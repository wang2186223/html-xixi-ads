My husband and I have been married for two years, but he has always been very cold towards me. Not only that, he has also been having affairs with other women. I lost all hope in him and threw a divorce agreement in his face. I'm done with this; let's get a divorce! After the divorce, I not only gained my freedom but also inherited billions in wealth! At this point, my ex-husband came back to me, kneeling in front of me and begging for my forgiveness. Should I forgive him? （I highly recommend a captivating book that I couldn't put down for three days and nights. It's incredibly engaging and a must-read. The title of the book is "Revenge of the Entertainment Queen" You can find it by searching for it in the search bar.）
