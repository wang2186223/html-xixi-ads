###Chapter 1 First Love Returns


"Isabella Taylor, if you can't have a child, get out of the Brown Family!"



At Aiden Brown's birthday party, Isabella of the Brown Family overheard people gossiping that she couldn't have children.



Her husband Michael Brown's mother, Stella Hall, felt embarrassed



She slapped Isabella in public and gave her an ultimatum.



Isabella covered her swollen face and received a photo as she left the Brown Villa in disgrace.



In the photo, romantic rose petals were arranged in a heart shape,and the birthday backdrop made of balloons was beautifully vibrant.



The girl standing in the center was stunningly beautiful, smiling sweetly and happily at the camera. Clenching her fingers. Isabella was furious because Michaef had refused to attend Aiden's birthday party, causing her to be scolded harshly.



Yet, he had meticulously arranged a birthday scene for his first love and was celebrating her birthday!



Gritting her teeth. Isabella turned around, got into her car, and drove off with a sharp turn.



She also wanted to have children, but in the three years of marriage,Michael had never touched her. How was she supposed to conceive?Asexual reproduction?



But the Brown Family was pressuring her and threatening her.



If she couldn't get pregnant, she feared she wouldn't be able to keep her position as Mrs. Brown in the Brown Family.



After all, Michael only had hatred for her, not love. If she were kicked out of the Brown Family, he would be the first to raise his hands in approval.



Isabella made a turn and drove onto the main road.


The photo showed a corner of the background, and Isabella recognized it as a well-known hotel in Evergreen City.



When she arrived, the clock struck midnight.



Isabella pushed the door open, and a"bang" exploded above her head.



Fireworks lit up the sky, their dazzling colors making Isabella a bit dizzy.



She pursed her lips and pushed open the door to the banquet hall.



A wave of lively noise hit her, and the crowd was cheering.′′Kiss,kiss." No one noticed Isabella's sudden appearance.



A long table was set in the center of the banquet hall, with four people sitting around it.



Each person had a seductive girl in their arms.



And her husband, Michael, was sitting in the host's seat,holding Bianca Taylor, whose long hair flowed down her back.



Her innocent and pure face was now flushed red from the crowd's teasing, and she looked at Michael with big, watery eyes.



Michael met her gaze, his eyes tender and affectionate.



He had a faint smile on his lips, but it was clear it came from the heart.



In the three years Isabella had been married to him, he had never smiled at her. "Who would have thought, Michael, undefeatedI in the casino,would lose on purpose just to kiss Bianca!"



"Yeah, Bianca. In the years you were abroad, Michael didn't have any other women around him because of you. Now that you're back you can't let him down!"



Hearing this. Bianca's face turned even redder, and her gaze at Michael was filled with pure affection.



From the moment Isabella saw the face in the photo, she knew she wouldn't be able to keep her position as Michael's wife this time.



For no other reason than that Bianca was Michael's first love, whom he could never have!



She was also Isabella's half-sister.



Back then, the Brown Family disapproved of Bianca's status, broke them up, and forced Michael to marry Isabella. On the wedding day. Bianca left heartbroken. If it weren't for
Aiden's disapproval, Michael would have probably left the wedding to chase after her.



The sight of the two gazing at each otherwith deep affection hurt Isabella's heart.



Seeing their heads getting closer and closer.



Isabella cleared her throat, drawing everyone's attention.



She leaned lazily against the door, arms crossed, and said, "I was wondering which woman had such charm that he couldn't even attend Mr. Brown's birthday. Turns out it's you! Long time no see,my shameless sister Bianca! Your mom was a mistress when she had you, and now you're here to seduce Michael.What,is the mistress gene hereditary? Michael lost on purpose just to kiss you.You are a born actress!"



Bianca was still the same as three years ago,always playing the victim. As soon as Isabella's harsh words came out, Bianca's eyes immediately reddened, as if she had suffered a great grievance."Isabella, you misunderstood. We were just playing around. At a friends' gathering. everyone suggested playing cards, and sínce gambling for money seemed boring, we decided to play for other stakes."



Isabella curled her lips into a cold smile



She understood Bianca's little schemes.



She was subtly flaunting that Michael's friends included her in their activities but excluded Isabella, implying that as Michael's wife, she was actually nothing.



But no matter what, Isabella was Michael's wife now.



No matter how much Michael loved Bianca, she still had to bear the label of a mistress.



Moreover,it was Isabella who are originally engaged to Michael. Michael and Bianca's love was never accepted by everyone from the start!



Isabella was stunningly beautiful, with striking features, and when she sneered, her aura was overwhelming.



Bianca, with her delicate demeanor, was completely overshadowed in front of her.



"If you like playing around, come to me. I know plenty of games that will leave you wanting more!" Isabella said.



Bianca pursed her lips, hiding the disdain in her eyes. "Isabella, you might not know, but the way Michael and his friends play cards is different from what you learned in the countryside. It's very complicated; Michael taught me all night, and I still couldn't get it."



Everyone knew that Isabella was not favored by her father, Indigo Taylor. When she was young, she made a mistake that angered Indigo, and she was sent to the countryside.


She wasn't brought back until she was an adult. "You couldn't learn because you're stupid, spending all your time thinking about how to seduce men." Isabella mercilessly exposed."As for me, I've been playing cards since Í was á child. NJo matter how difficult the game,it's a piece of cake to me."



Humiliated repeatedly, Bianca couldn't maintain her composure.



She looked at Isabella with teary eyes, "Isabella, I know you've never liked me, thinking I stole Dad's love. When we were kids, you pushed me down the stairs, almost making me spend my life in a wheelchair. Now you're jealous of my past with Michael and falsely accuse me of seducing him. I stayed abroad for three years to make way for you. Today is just a normal friends' gathering.Just because you're Mrs. Brown, does that mean you have to restrict Michael's basic social interactions?"



Then she looked at Michael with teary eyes, "Michael, if that's the case, then we shouldn't see each other anymore. I'm afraid... I'm afraid Isabella will misunderstand again."



From the moment Isabella appeared until now, Michael hadn't given her a single glance It wasn't until now that he looked at her coldly, "She has no ríght to control me. She's just an irrelevant person; who cares if she misunderstands."



Bianca's lips instinctively curled up, buat she tried to restrain herself."Michael, don't say that about Isabella..."



Michael raised his hand to pat her head, looking at Isabella with eyes as cold as ice. "Get out. This isn't a place for you!"



Isabella was so angry that she laughed, her eyes cold. "This shabby hotel is indeed unworthy of me. Michael, celebrating your first love Bianca's birthday, couldn't you have chosen a better place? Is Bianca unworthy of the top banquet hall at The Grand Majestic Hotel?"



The Grand Majestic Hotel was the most luxurious hotel in Evergreen City.



The top banquet hall there could directly host state guests.



Although Bianca knew she wasn't worthy, hearing Isabella say it so bluntly still made her feel bad. Especially since Isabella kept emphasiżing het státus as Mrs. Brown.it was like a slap in Bianca's face.



Bianca was furious but couldn't say anything, feeling utterly stifled!


Michael frowned and glared at Isabella, "Shut up!"



"Fíne." Isabella obediently shut up, walked over in her high heels.and disdainfully looked at the crease on his pants, which was caused by Bianca sitting on his lap.



"Throw away those pants. They're so wrinkled, even a tramp wouldn't wear them!"



With one sentence, she insulted both of them.


Everyone around gasped; Isabella's words were indeed sharp!


Isabella didn't care how ugly Michael's face looked and pulled a chair to sit next to him. She elegantly crossed her legs. "The fireworks are done, the cards have been played, isn't it time to go home?"



"Go home?" Michael's deep eyes shot out two sharp, mocking glances. He sat up straight, towering over Isabella, exuding a sentse of oppression. "Go home for what? To watch you act like a bítch ín heat,trying to seduce me in every possible way?"



Isabella was infuriated.



But her personality was such that the angrier she got, the brighter her smile became.



No matter how much it hurt inside, she would never admit defeat on the surface.



"As my husband, isn't that your duty? If you can't do it, then.naturally, I have to work a bit harder."
###Chapter 2 Divorce


A simple sarcastic remark, and Isabella's heart ached first.


No one knew that Isabella loved Michael.



Even though she had forced him to marry her with an engagement.she had secretly rejoiced for a long time because they became husband and wife.



But after Michael married her, he completely ignored her.



William didn't even want to touch her, and he found it annoying to even look at her.



The Brown Family kept urging her to have an heir, and her
grandfather Daniel Wilson also hoped she would have a child soon.



At first, she understood that William was upset about being separated from Bianca and didn't hold it against him. It was only tonight that she realized it was all for Biarrca.



How ironic!



They were already married, yet he remained physically faithful.



William had been married to someone else anyhow!


The more Isabella thought about it, the more stifled she felt, but her smile became brighter, "If you have a sexual dysfunction,I don't mind doing IVF. Or if you don't mind raising someone else's child,I can find a surrogate. You know, the prerequisite for your inheritance is to have a child. After tonight, you have two months to think it over. Anyway, you compromised to marry me for ten percent of the shares, so compromising to have a child for the management rights shouldn't be a big deal. I'm very open-minded.As long as you complete the task, I don't care how you play or how many lovers you have..."



Before Isabella could finish her sentence, William suddenly stood up and grabbed her jaw, pushing her back. The chair tilted back, and she hit the table behind her, barely steadying herself.



William's eyes were cold. "Isabella, how dare you treat me as a tool for having children?"



Of course Isabella dared.



When Daniel had an accident, she dared to force him to marry her with an engagement, so what else wouldn't she dare to do?



Isabella closed her eyes, enduring the discomfort, "IVF or surrogacy,or you can have the child with me yourself, your choice!"



Michael looked down at Isabella's cold, mocking face, countless emotions flashing in his eyes.



How many years had it been since someone threatened him like this?



Michael was so angry that he laughed, "You think you're worthy of having my child?"



Isabella also laughed, her beautiful eyes narrowing and shíning sharply.



"Fine!" She pushed Michael away, shifting her weight forward to bring the chair back to the ground.



As soon as she was back on her feet, she opened her bag, and threw a stack of papers in Michael's face. "Then let's get a divorce. Your friends are all here, so they can be witnesses. I don't want a useless cheater who can't even have children!"



No one knew how much courage it took for Isabella to say that.



The divorce agreement had been in her bag for a long time, ever since her 99th attempt to seduce Michael had failed.



She loved Michael, but this was as far as it could go.



She had tried very hard to be with him. Especially, he shouldn't have used Bianca to humiliate her.



With the backing of the Brown Family, Michael had always been a leader in their circle.



After Michael took over the company as an adult, he gradually turned the Brown Group into a multinational corporation, ranking among the world's top companies.



It had been a long time since anyone dared to throw somethíng in his face.



And in front of so many people.



The atmosphere in the banquet hall instantly turned icy, with only Bianca barely containing her excitement.



She pretended to mediate, "Isabella, how can you talk about divorce with Michael in front of so many people? You're trampling on Michael's dignity! Apologize to Michael, and forget about the divorce! If you're angry about the joke earlier, I apologize, Don't let it affect your relationship with Michael; that would be my fault!" "Who do you think you are? You think you have the right to affect my relationship with him?" Isabella looked Bianca up and down with disdain. "This is none of your business?"



Bianca,feeling wronged, closed her eyes with tears, her eyes full of malice.



She thought, 'Isabella, go ahead and be arrogant. The more arrogant you are, the more Michael will hate you.'



"Michael, if you want a divorce, sign the papers. Sexual dysfunction is one thing, but dragging out a divorce, are you even a man?"Isabella said.



Bianca,unwilling to give up, jumped in to defend Michae1. "Isabella,mind your words. Michael is a man, and it's too much to insult him like that!"



Isabella retorted, her probing gaze shifting between the two of them.
"A man? What, have you tried sleeping with him?"



If they had really slept together, Isabella could dema nd more in the divorce settlement.



After all, it would be adultery during the marriage



Bianca's face instantly turned red, her shy gaze sweeping over Michael.



She wished she could try!



After all. Michael was the man she had dreamed of since she was a child.



But unfortunately...



Bianca clenched her fists. "You don't have to slander me like this.Michael and I are innocent."



Isabella sneered, "Innocent like sitting on Michael's lap and kissing?That kind of innocent?" Bianca's face turned green.



Michael looked at Isabella with a cold smile, his eyes dlark and terrifying. "You want a divorce so badly, what, do you have someone else you like?"



"None of your business. Even if I don't have someone now, I can find someone after the divorce!" Isabella's eyes lifted, forming a beautiful arc.



She still had to fulfill Daniel's wish.


Finding a man willing to be with her wasn't hard.



Although finding someone better than Michael might be difficult,finding someone comparable was definitely possible!



"Besides, by divorcing, I'm doing you a favor. What are you dissatisfied with? Unless you don't want to give Bianca a proper status and want her to remain a mistress forever?" Isabella's meaningful tone made Bianca's face change. She looked at Michael with a pale, hopeful, and anxious expression. But Michael didn't even glance at her; he kept staring at Isabella as if trying to see through her.



After a long time, he slowly spoke, "Divorce, fine! You said you played cards since you were a kid. If you beat me, I'll sign."



Michael held up the deck of cards on the table, his narrowed eyes revealing unreadable emotions.



Isabella didn't speak, just looked at him and smiled.



Her smile was cold, with an indescribable mockery.


"Are you scared?" Michael threw the cards back on the table, his mouth curling in contempt.



Isabella coldly laughed, "Remember what you said. If you lose, don't cry!"



With that, she raised her hand and took off her trench coat. Isabella had come straight from Aiden's birthday banquet,stfll wearing the red dress from the event.



It was a dress she had specially chosen for herself, with a backless design that revealed her beautiful shoulder blades and a large area of delicate skin.



The cinched waist design accentuated her slender waist, and her chest formed a beautiful curve.



She was as beautiful as a siren, making people breathless.



All the men present were staring!



How could Michael bear to neglect such a beautiful woman for so many years?



Could Michael really have a sexual dysfunction?



Many people, daringly, glanced at Michael's crotch. Michael's face instantly turned ugly.



HIis gaze fell on Isabella, his hand on the table clenched, veíns bulging.



Bianca saw this and was so jealous her eyes were spitting fire!



She thought, 'Isabella, that bitch, grew up in the countryside but turned out so beautiful. With such a seductive appearance, she really knows how to lure men. Absolutely despicable!'



Isabella sat down at the table, leaning forward slightly, casually playing with the cards in front of her. "How do you want to play?Blackjack? Roulette? Or Poker?"



Michael's friends exchanged glances. Wow, Isabella really seemed to know her stuff!



"Blackjack, don't want you to lose too badly!" Michael said.



Isabella gave a wicked smile and started shuffling the cards Her fingers were long and slender.



Fifty-four playing cards were manipulated into varíous tricks by her ten fingers, even the rich kids who were used to playing cards couldn't help but exclaim, "Impressive!"



Just based on her shuffling skills, Isabella was definitely a pro!



Even Michael's gaze towards Isabella changed slightly.



Did Isabella really know how to play cards? Where did she learn it?



After shuffling, Isabella leaned over and dealt Michael a card.



Her deep cleavage was fully exposed due to the leaning motion,making everyone swallow hard.



Michael's face turned black on the spot!
###Chapter 3 You Can't Let Go of Me, Have You Fallen in Love with Me?
Isabella dealt the cards quickly, her movements smooth and graceful. After dealing, she rested her chin on one hand, her eyes seductive. "Want more?"



Michael was looking at her, not the cards. Next to him,Bianca was anxious but didn't dare show it too much.



She gently nudged his arm to remind him, "Michael..."



Isabella raised her eyelids slightly. "By the way, let me remind you.Michael and I are not divorced yet. All the expenses for your birthday today are considered marital assets. I'll have someone settle the accounts later. If you know what's good for you,you'll pay me back willingly. Otherwise, I'll have to sue you!"



Bianca's face turned black.


Especially when she saw that Michael had no reaction to Isabella's words, her face turned as pale as a sheet.



"Want more?" Isabella ignored Bianca and asked Michael again.



Michael tapped the cards with his well-defined fingers and said calmly, "Yes."



Isabella suddenly smiled. She hadn't even dealt the cards yet but stood up, leaning on the table.



"You've lost!" Her body leaned towards him, her deep cleavage appearing right in front of Michael.



Bianca wished she could rush over and cover Michael's eyes.



But she didn't dare. She could only shout unwillingly from the side."You haven't even dealt the cards. How can you say Michael lost?Isabella, if you don't know how to play cards, just admit it. Why pretend?"



Isabella clicked her tongue, her gaze sweeping disdainfully over Bianca before landing on Michael.



Her eyes seemed to say: You're a highly praised businessman.how could you fall for someone as stupid as Bianca?



She picked up the card Michael wanted, flipped it over, and showed it to everyone.



Bianca had just heard Michael explain the rules of blackjack and still remembered them.



When she saw the card, her face changed immediately.



Michael had really lost!



He lost at the card table, to Isabella, that bitch!



"This is impossible!" Bianca screamed. "You must have done something. How could Michael lose!" Isabella found it amusing. "So what if he loses now? With you around, he'll only keep losing in the future! Where is your disgusting tone? Keep it up."



Bianca's face turned ugly.



She looked to Michael for help, hoping he would speak up for her.



But Michael's eyes were fixed on Isabella, not even sparíng a glance at her.



His eyes seemed to be brewing a storm, and thins were about to froze.



David Miller, who knew Michael best, reacted and signaled everyone to leave.



Bianca didn't want to go but was dragged away by David.



Unless he wanted to lose, Michael had never lost at the card table.
Unexpectedly, Michael's first loss was to Isabella.



The banquet hall door slammed shut, and Isabella looked away from the intense eye contact.



She turned and bent down to get her coat



Her bare back was exposed to Michael, her shoulder blades looking beautiful.



Michael's eyes darkened for a moment. He grabbed Isabella's slender wrist and pulled her over.



He was strong, pulling Isabella off balance. Before she could react,he lifted her onto the table by her waist.



MichaeI leaned over, looking down at her, his eyes half-closed,danger emanating from him.′′Cheating in front of me, huh?"



And her cheating technique was so skilled that if he hadn't marked the cards, he wouldn't have noticed. Michael suddenly felt that after three years of marriage, he didn't know Isabella at all.



"Do you have evidence, Mr. Brown? If not, please don't slander me.Or are you just a sore loser trying to avoid divorce?"



"Divorce? Don't you want a child to secure your position as Mrs.Brown?"



Isabella sneered. "There are plenty of good men out there. Without you, I can find another anytime. A child is just a child. If you don't want to have one with me, plenty of men will. After all, I'm so good-looking. If I post an announcement, many men will come to me willingly."



"No wonder you're so eager to divorce me. You must have planned to use the alimony I give you to support your lover." Michael's face darkened, his eyes like knives. "Isabella, do you think I'm dead?"



"A proper ex should be as good as dead, right?" Isabella felt uncomfortable being grabbed and twisted.
 They were so close that her struggling movements rubbed against Michael's legs, instantly arousing him.



"You want a man so badly? Fine, T'll satisfy you!" He grabbed her shoulders and pushed her back, his strong body pressing down on her.



Isabella was stunned for a moment. Realizing what he was about to do,she resisted even more fiercely. "Michael, what are you doing? I don't want you anymore. Get away from me. You're disgusting!"



She tried to kick him, but he grabbed her ankle and pulled her over,her legs spread wide. Michael's waist was between her legs, the position suggestive!



She felt Michael's growing erection, and Isabella was dumbfounded.



What was wrong with Michael? She had tried to seduce him ninety-nine times before, and he never responded.



Why was he reacting now that she mentioned divorce? Could Michael have some kind of fetish?



Michael started unbuttoning his shirt, his long fingers fitted the black silk fabric, creating a mesmerizing sight.



But Isabella had no time to appreciate it; she just wanted to run!



If it were before, she would have been happy if Michael treated her like this,even responding passionately.



But now. on the card table where he had been with Bianca, she only felt disgusted.



It was as if Michael had stripped away her last bit of dignity, thrown it on the ground, and trampled on it.



She couldn't stand it!



"Michael, are you even a man? Wanting to have sex with me when I ask for a divorce? What, did you suddenly realize you can't let me go and have fallen in love with me?"It was like a bucket of cold water poured over Michael. He stopped unbuttoning.



He looked down at Isabella, his features cold and angry


"Fallen in love with you?" He seemed to be hit where it hurt,his expression mocking. "Isabella, you wish!"



Seeing that he no longer wanted to force her, Isabella sighed in relief and pushed him away. "Then what? I ask for a divorce to fulfill your great love, and you want to sleep with me and give me a child? Don't tell me you suddenly realized you could endure a bit more for the sake of control"







Her words undoubtedly enraged Michael!



Michael's eyes darkened, and he grabbed Isabella's neck, his fingers tightening. "Isabella, who do you think you are? Divorce can only be initiated by me. You have no right!" Isabella's face turned red as she couldn't breathe.



She grabbed Michael's hand and spoke with difficulty. "Then go ahead and initiate it. If you don't, I'll think you really love me and can't bear to divorce me!"



Isabella's words seemed to disgust Michael.



He let go, took a wet wipe, and slowly wiped the places he had touched her.



Then he crumpled it up and threw it away.′′Divorce is fine. But you get nothing!"
###Chapter 4 Uncle Thomas


With that, Michael not even glanced at Isabella before turning and leaving.



Michael's upright figure was filled with intense anger.



The loud commotion startled the people in the hallway outside



No one dared to speak, all eyes on his furious face.



Bianca, through the automatically closing banquet hall doors,saw Isabella on the table with disheveled clothes and immediately bit her lip hard.



The terrifying thought that "Michael touched Isabella"swirled in Bianca's mind. Without thinking, she turned to chase after Michael.



In the banquet hall, Isabella struggled to get off the table. Just now, her waist was almost broken by Michael's gríp.



Looking at the closed door, Isabella couldn't hold back and ctrsed harshly, "Michael,you bastard!"



She had pretended to be a gentle wife for him for three years, but at this moment, the unrestrained Isabella from the countryside had returned.



Back then, she married him and used the Brown Family to save the Wilson Family, which was true.



But her love for him was also true.



Otherwise, she wouldn't have humbled herself and lived a lowly life.in the Brown Family for three years.



But now, with Bianca back in the country, Michael was entangled with her again, publicly disrespecting her as Mrs. Brown.



Isabella decided that she and Michael should just both lose! Isabella limped out of the hotel, standing at the entrance,the cold night wind making her tears well up.



She took out her phone and called her uncle to pick her up.



The black limited edition Bentley arrived quickly, making a beautiful drift stop in front of Isabella.



Thomas Wilson got out and opened the passenger door, "What's going on? Why are you here alone? Where's Michael?"



"Thomas." As soon as Isabella saw Thomas, her eyes reddened involuntarily. Seeing her aggrieved look, Thomas immediately knew that Michael had bullied her again.



He was instantly furious, "Tell me, how did Michael bully you this time? I'll stand up for you!"



When Isabella insisted on marrying Michael, the whole family was against it. Michael clearly had an engagement with Isabella, but he was entangled with the illegitimate daughter of the Taylor Family.Bianca.



A heartless man like Michael didn't deserve Isabella.



Although he was Isabella's elder, Thomas was actually not much older than her, only a few years apart.



So,since childhood, Isabella loved to act spoiled with Thomas.



Hearing that Thomas wanted to stand up for her, all her emotions surged up. She unconsciously hugged his arm, resting her head on his shoulder, and rubbed against him. "Thomas, I want to divorce Michael. Help me find a good lawyer."



Although Thomas hadn't taken over the Wilson Family's business,he had some standing in the financial world.



He ran a financial company with the best legal team in all of Eldoria. It was said that the chief of his team had never lost a case.



Thomas naturally understood Isabella's thoughts.



Seeing her hurt to the point of wanting a divorce, he knew Michael must have done something unforgivable.



A cold glint flashed in his eyes, but his face showed only concern as he rubbed her head. "I told you from the start that Michael wasn't right for you, that you shouldn't humble yourself. Now you regret it.don't you?"



Isabella's eyes were red and misty,′′regretit so much!" She paused,then rubbed her head against his palm, "By the way, Thomas,don't let the other uncles and grandpa know about this for now. I'm afraid they'll get so angry they'll kill Michael."



It wasn't that she couldn't bear Michael's death; she just didn't want Thomas and Daniel to get into trouble because of Michael.



In her own words: He's not worth it! Thomas nodded, "Your uncles are all out of the country right now.and Daniel's health isn't great. If he knew. he'd get sick from anger It's better not to let them know. With your little uncle here, I won let you suffer. But..."



Isabella knew what Thomas wanted to say, "Don't worry. I'll find a way to fulfill grandpa's wish. There are plenty of good men in the world; I don't have to be with Michael."



Perhaps because Daniel was getting older, he valued family heritage more and more, especially his only daughter Grace Wilson's child Isabella!



Back then, shortly after Grace passed away, Indigo brought his mistress and Bianca to the house.



At that time, Isabella was young and impulsive, easily falling into their trap and almost being driven out by Indigo,



It was the Wilson Family who got the news and took Isabella back.


At that time, Daniel had already taken the family to live in seclusion
in the countryside. No one knew that Daniel was once the famous Gambling King.



Later. Daniel's enemies found them, and the Wilson Family suffered a heavy blow. To protect her family, to spite Bianca and her mother Harper Clark, and to fulfill a childhood dream, Isabella took the marriage contract with the Brown Family and forced Michael to marry her.



She thought that with her intelligence, even if Michael didn't love her at first, she could work hard to make a good life and not worry Daniel.



But now, she was on the verge of divorce!



She had tried so hard to seduce Michael and have a child, mainly because she didn't want Daniel to die with regrets.



"Don't do anything rash!" Hearing her dangerous words, Thomas couldn't help but tap her forehead.



Isabella covered her head,′′Don't worry, Thomas. I know what I'm
doing. Even if I'm in a hurry to have a child, I won't let myself suffer."



Isabella had always been decisive since she was a child. Seeing her determination. Thomas didn't persuade her further and drove her away.



Sitting in the passenger seat, Isabella lowered her head and sent a message: [Find me a man as soon as possible, taller than Michael,more handsome, smarter,better in every way!]



Soon, a reply came: [Isabella, you're finally back? Don't worry, it's easy. I'll get it done!]



Michael returned to the Brown Family the next evening.



After Aiden's birthday party, the Brown Family usually had a small gathering.



As soon as he walked in, Aiden hit him with a cane. "How dare you come back? Look at what you've done,Isabelfa was so angry she left. Why did you even come back?"



Hearing that Isabella hadIn't returned. Michael's face darkened. He clutched his arm where he was hit and looked around, but couldn't find Isabella.



Michael's expression turned cold, and his voice followed suit.′′She′S not here. Where did she go?"



Aiden was so angry he was panting, "How dare you ask? Isabella is your wife. You don't even know where she went. What kind of husband are you?!"
###Chapter 5 Isabella, You're Serious about This!


Michael really didn't know.



He had been married to Isabella for three years, and when he thought about it carefully, he seemed to know nothing about her!



Michael's mother, Stella, had a stern face. "She went out to find you last night and hasn't come back yet. Who acts like her? Married for so many years, she hasn't gotten pregnant, and now she's throwing a tantrum and not coming home! And you, you didn't even come back for your grandfather's birthday yesterday. You can't act like this out of spite. If it were something serious, it would be one thing but it was just to celebrate Bianca's birthday. How could your grandfather not be angry? Alright, go apologize. If you really like that Bianca, wait until you divorce Isabella,then you can marry her."



Hearing Stella's words, he recalled Isabella's temper when she mentioned divorce last night.



Michael's expression turned cold."Mom, did you mention divorce to her?"



"Of course!" Stella didn't think there was anything wrong. "She's been married for three years and hasn't had a child. What's the point of keeping her? Anyway. I don't care. I already told her last night. I'll give her two more months. If she still can't get pregnant.she can get out!"



Michael gave her a deep look. "Mom, this is between her and me.Don't interfere anymore."



With that, he walked into the house with a cold face.



Stella was stunned for a moment, then chased after him."Michael,what do you mean by that? You..."



Before she could finish, she met Aiden's cold, stern eyes and swallowed the rest of her words.



Aiden warned Stella and then turned his gaze to Michael. "Come with me." Michael took off his suit jacket, handed it to a nearby servant.and followed Aiden upstairs.



As soon as they entered the study. Aiden heavily leaned on his cane."Kneel down!"



Michael stood still. "Grandpa, I'm not a boy anymore!"



Aiden held a prestigious position in the Brown Family, and no one dared to defy him.



When he disciplined the younger generation, he never held back.
Michael and his brothers had all been punished by kneeling before.



Aiden couldn't help but hit him with his cane again. "You know you're an adult, yet look at the foolish things you did yesterday. Is that something a mature man would do? Isabella is your wife. You didn't even get her a bouquet for her birthday, but you bought fireworks for Bianca's birthday. Isn't that humiliating Isabella? No.wonder she wants a divorce! I don't care; I only want Isabella. If you drive her away, don't come back to the Brown Family, I don.'t have a useless grandson like you!" Aiden continued, "I understand Isabella. She might be asking for a divorce out of impulse. But if you don't hurry and win her back.she might really leave, and then youll tegret it!"



Michael stood straight, seemingly unfazed by the pain in his leg.



His eyes held a hint of coldness. "If Isabella leaves, she leaves. Do you think I can't find another wife?"



′′T2'm afraid you won't find a wife as good as Isabella!" Aiden added."No,you definitely won't find one as good as Isabella!"



Michael didn't speak, his eyes lowered, his expression cold to the point of indifference.



Seeing him like this gave Aiden a headache. "I just don't understand. When Isabella came with the engagement token, you agreed to marry her. Didn't you like her and protect her when you were young? When she was sent to the countryside,you always wanted to find her. How come things became different now?"



Michael let out a cold laugh. "People change." Aiden was infuriated by his words, his cane thumpíng loudly.
"Regardless, you're married to Isabella and should be responsible for her. If you continue like this, I'll have to revoke your status as the heir! The Brown Family's company will never be handed over to someone untrustworthy!"



Hearing this, Michael's face darkened.



He looked up, his expression calm as he stared at Aiden. After a long while, he sneered. "You can announce right now that my second brother, Nolan Brown, will be the heir. Let's see if he can handle it!"



With that, he turned and walked away without looking back.



Behind him, Aiden was furious, throwing his cane at him.



It hit the closed door with a bang, making Aiden's eyes roll in anger.


 
He firmly believed that Michael would regret it in the future! After leaving the study, Michael received a call from his marital home."Mr. Brown, we just received a document. It looks like a court summons."



"A summons?" Michael squinted. "Where did the summons come from?"



The servant's voice sounded nervous. "It's a divorce summons from Mrs. Brown."



Hearing this, Michael's expression turned icy.



He hung up the phone and quickly walked downstairs.



The servants at the Brown Villa hurriedly handed him his coat,and Stella took a few steps to catch up.′′Dinner is about to be served.Where are you going again?"



He wasn't there for Aiden's birthday banquet yesterday, and now he was leaving again. The family would surely be displeased with him.


Did he still want to be the heir of the Brown Family?



Michael dlidn't look back, "I have something urgent!"



Behind him. Stella stomped her feet in anger!



Michael drove back to his marital home and saw the name of the opposing lawyer on the summons. His eyes narrowed dangerously.



Ryan Martin, a renowned lawyer with an undefeated record,working for the top financial group, Global Financia1 Solutions.



It was said he only handled commercial cases and never dealt with divorces.



Michael thought, Why did he make an exception for Isabella's divorce case? Do they know each other beforehand? Or is he one of the people Isabella mentioned, anyone but him?^



The servant didn't dare look at Michael's face. After handing him the summons, they quickly retreated. Michael stood alone in front of the floor-to-ceiling window in the living room, his tall and imposing figure as if wrapped in frost.



After a long while, Michael let out a cold laugh.



Then, he took out his phone and called Isabella.



He found that both his calls and WhatsApp messages were blocked.



Michael laughed coldly, his fingers gripping the phone so tightly that his knuckles turned white.



He thought, 'Fine! Isabella, you're serious about this!



He took a deep breath and called Ryan.



On the other end, Ryan looked at the flashing phone screen and then at Thomas, who was half-hidden in the  shadows across the desk.′′Michae] is calling." Thomas reached out. "Give me the phone."


Ryan handed the phone over, and as soon as Thomas answered.
Michael's cold, angry voice came through. "Where is Isabella?
Divorce? Fine! Let her tell me herself!"



"Isabella doesn't want to see you. Mr. Brown, it would be wise to sign the divorce papers. After all, you were once married. Taking it to court won't be good for either of you."



Michael laughed. In all of Evergreen City, no one dared to sue him!"You better advise her to think it through, or else..."



Thomas's voice turned cold. "Michael, don't think Isabella has no one to back her up."



"Ifyou want to play threats, go ahead and try!"
###Chapter 6 Who is he?


The call was abruptly cut off, and Michael's face instantly darkened.



He was right after all.



Isabella was in a hurry to divorce him and dared to disappear just like that. It turned out she had already found someone to rely on.



The divorce wasn't even finalized, and she dared to openly leave with Thomas.



Thinking about how Isabella left with Thomas last night dressed like that and hadn't returned, a fire of anger ignited in Michael's chest, growing stronger by the second.



Glancing back at their marital home, Michael grabbed his coat and strode out.



He had to see for himself what Isabella was up to behind his back.
Divorce? He wouldn't agree to it. She shouldn't even think about if.



Just as he got into the car, his phone rang.



It was his friend, Ethan Martinez.



Michael pressed the answer button, his voice cold, "What is it?"


Ethan was taken aback but couldn't suppress his curiosity. "Well, 1heard that last night you threw a party at the hotel to celebrate Bianca's birthday, and Isabella caught you red-handed. She was so furious that she even brought out the divorce papers. Is that true?"



Michael frowned sharply,′′YOou called just to say this?"



Seeing that the call was about to be hung up, Ethan quickly got to the point."Don't you want to know where Isabella is?"



"You know?" Michael's eyes narrowed. "Not only do I know, but everyone in our circle knows."



Ethan's tone became more animated, "Last night, a young and beautiful lady was online looking for a high-quality man. Her requirements were that he had to be taller, more handsome,and younger than you-in short, better than you in every way. Thínk about it, who else but Isabella would dare to do something like that?"



The veins on Michael's forehead throbbed,"She really said that?"



"Absolutely. She offered fifty million dollars. Who else in Evergreen City has that kind of audacity? I heard she already found a man who met her criteria and took him to The Grand Majestic Hotel. By now, I bet the two of them are..."



Before Ethan could finish, Michael hung up the phone with a dark expression.



He floored the gas pedal and headed straight for The Grand Majestic Hotel. Meanwhile, at the top floor of The Grand Majestic Hotel.



Isabella was suddenly embraced from behind and pressed against the large floor-to-ceiling window.



The man had just come out of the shower, water droplets still clinging to his well-defined body, eventually trickling into the towel wrapped around his waist.



Isabella turned around, stunned by the man's impressive physique.Her delicate hands caressed his strong arms.



She couldn't help but marvel.



This body, this face, compared to Michael, was so much easier to obtain.



Thinking about the cold treatment she had endured for three years in the Brown Family, Isabella felt she had been greatly wronged.



Michael wouldn't even look at her, yet she kept trying to get close to him.



Without Michael, what kind of man couldn't she find?



Why should she endure his mistreatment?



"Isabella, are you satisfied with my body?" The man took Isabella's hand and guided it over his body, his deep voice seductive.



From his chest to his abs, moving downward.



Isabella's hand felt like it was on fire. She slowly lifted it and hooked the man's chin, "Of course I'm satisfied. As long as you help me, I'lI give you whatever you want."



"Really? Then let's..." The man lowered his head to kiss her lips.



A loud noise separated them, the door slammed against the wall by a heavy object. Before Isabella could react, two rows of men in black suits rushed in, pinning the man beside her to the ground.



The man instinctively resisted, but the men in black pulled out self-defense weapons.



Seeing that someone was about to get hurt, Isabella stepped forward and coldly ordered, "What are you doing? Let him go!"



"Who dares to let him go!" A cold and commanding male voice came from the doorway. Isabella looked up to see Michael standing there with a grim expression.



Michael, dressed in a black suit, exuded an overwhelming pressure.his entire demeanor murderous.



Isabella suddenly understood. She grabbed a coat and draped it over herself, taking a few steps forward."Michael, this is a hotel.Who allowed you to barge into my room? Let him go!"



"Let him go?" Michael's voice was icy, his gaze sweeping over the shirtless man on the floor with intense intimidation, "Dare to touch. my woman, and you think Tll let him go?"



Isabella didn't want to argue with him, her words laced with sarcasm, "You should have received the divorce papers by now Michael. Isn't it ridiculous to act like a loving couple at this potnt?"



Michael didn't respond.



His sharp eyes fell on her exposed legs, then scanned the bed,finally resting on her red lips, confirming nothing had happened



Only then did he enter the room.



Michael had shares in the hotel, and knowing he was there, the hotel's managements were in a panic.



They all showed up.



Seeing the scene before them, they quickly retreated to the hallway,afraid that even one more glance would get them involved.
Michael walked up to the man pinned on the ground, his voice as cold as if it came from hell, "Where did you touch her?"



The man had heard their conversation, but the fifty million dollars Isabella offered was too much to pass up, an amoune he couldn'e even imagine in his lifetime.



He swallowed hard, "You two are already divorced. Whatever we do is our freedom..."



"Freedom? Let's see if your life is more important than your freedom." Michael stepped on his wrist, and with a crack, the man's face turned pale, drenched in cold sweat.



The man was in so much pain he couldn't even make a sound.



Isabella didn't expect Michael to go this crazy, "Michael, what are you doing? Who told you to hurt him?"



Before she could get close, she was scooped up and slammed into Michael's chest. The coat she was wearing slipped off one shoulder, and Michaeľlooked down to see her wearing only a sexy camisole. with large areas of bare skin.



His eyes darkened instantly.



Was this how she had been with that man just now?



Seeing his gaze, Isabella was furious. She raised her hand and started hitting Michael, "You lunatic, let me go!"



"And then what? Let you go find another man?" Michael easily caught her hands, his eyes narrowing with disdain and mockery."Isabella, you want a man so badly that you'd gofor someone who'd do anything for money?"



Isabella lifted her head, her cold and beautiful face defiant."SO what? At least he's clean, has a good body, a sweet mouth, and can give me what I want. Can you, Michael?"



This completely provoked Michael. He coldly glanced at the man on the floor and ordered,′′Drag him out and cripple him." The men obeyed and quickly took the man away.


"Michael, you can't hurt him. He's my man!"


She had paid for him. How could Michael just take him away?



"Your man?" Michael's entire demeanor was oppressive. He grabbed her wrist with one hand and loosened his suit with the other.turning to press Isabella onto the bed.



He lifted her chin, "Isabella, I haven't signed the divorce papers yet.and you dare to fool around with another man in front of me.Believe me, if I submit today's events to the court,you won't get a single penny, let alone a hundred million dollars!"
###Chapter 7 It's Too Late to Regret Now


He sneered coldly. "Without mhotey. do you think mhat mun outside will still listen to you? He wan't eve you."



"Michael, you bastard!" Isabella's face changed. Michael actually humiliated her like this.



"Don't forget. you were the one who cheated first. Don't slander me.The property division will be what it should be. If you shorichange me. I'll light you to the end."



What a joke.



For the past three years, she hadn't even bought a single luxuey item, and when he didn't come home at night, she even saved on groceries.



He could only dream about leaving all the money to Bianca? Isabella said, "Also, even if I have to money, I still have enough to fight a divorce case with you. This marriage, I'm definitely ending it!"



Hearing her words, Michael's face darkened even more.



The strength in his hand involuntarily increased.



Thinking of something, he suddenly sneered, "Really? Why do I think you can't even afford the room fee now?"



Isabella's chin hurt from his grip. She glared at Michael with reddened eyes, making muffled sounds.



Looking at Isabella's defiant face, now adorned with makeup she never wore before, and her constantly twisting,graceful figure,
Michael's deep eyes were filled with desire.



Isabella never wore makeup at home.



How come as soon as she mentioned divorce, she not only learned to put on makeup but also learned to wear such clothes to seduce men?



When did she change so much?



Why hadn't he noticed at all?



Taking advantage of Michael's momentary distraction, Isabella suddenly pushed him away.



She tightened her coat around her and kept her distance from him.



Before speaking, she rubbed her chin and cheeks, "Michael, are you crazy? You like Bianca. Isn't my asking for a divorce exactly what you want?"



For the past three years, he had treated her like she was invisible,and having a child with him was like asking for his life.



Now that she mentioned divorce, he was unhappy? And he said she couldn't pay the room fee. Did he think she
couldn't live without him?


Isabella completely ignored Michael behind her, snorted coldly, and walked out of the room in her high heels.



As soon as she reached the lobby, the manager stopped her. "Ms Taylor, if you're leaving, please settle the room fee."



Then, seeing Michael following behind Isabella, the manager immediately lowered his head and respectfully greeted,"Mr.Brown."



Isabella rolled her eyes, casually pulled out a card from her bag, and handed it over.



She had booked this hotel room on a whim.



Now that Michael had come over and ruined her plans, she couldn't stay here any longer. The manager took the card with both hands and went to the front desk to swipe it.



Michael stood behind her, his suit jacket draped over his arm revealing the black shirt underneath.



Broad shoulders, narrow waist,long legs.



His eyes were fixed on Isabella in front of him.



Many passersby couldn't help but be deeply attracted to him.



But Isabella was completely unaware.



She just wanted to leave quickly.



The manager soon returned with the card,′′Ms. Taylor, I'm sorry but this card can't be used."



Isabella was slightly stunned. Without thinking much, she took out
another card from her bag.



Still no good.



Isabella took out all the cards in her bag.



None of them worked.



All her cards were frozen.



Isabella turned around and finally looked directly at Michael, who had followed her down, "Did you do this?"



Most of the cards she had now were given by him, and the other two were from Aiden.



Now none of them worked. It must have something to do with him.
Michael didn't deny it. He walked over to her, looking down at her, "Who said this marriage was definitely ending? Before the lawsuit starts, I freeze my own supplementary cards. Is there a problem? Or do you think I would let you use my money to support your lover outside?"



Isabella was furious.



She hadn't expbected Michael, as the heir of the Brown Family and a business tycoon in Evergreen City, to use such underhanded tactics to force her to comply.



Thinking about what he had just said, she suddenly understood something.



She wanted to laugh, "Michael, do you really think using this method will make me compromise, pretend nothing happened,and obediently go home with you?"



Michael's face darkened at her words, not thinking she had any other options, "What else do you want? If you don't come back with me, where can you go?" For the past three years, whenever she threw a tantrum, he never really argued with her, and they had gotten along until now.



Today would be no exception.



After speaking, Michael frowned slightly, "Grandpa is still waiting for us to give an explanation. Don't waste time."



There was no emotion in his eyes.



He simply saw this as a matter of restoring his male pride, not even curious about why she wanted a divorce.



Isabella knew all too well how cold and heartless Michael was.



His love wasn't with her, and it wouldn't be any different in another three years.



She found it utterly pointless,′′Iwon't go back with you. Give it up."
Michael frowned, "What did you say?"



Isabella coldly curled her lips, "Isn't my meaning clear enough?Michael,you know how you've treated me these past three years.Now that Bianca is back, you immediately go to her. You use her to humiliate me, just to force me to divorce you, right?So now that things are going your way, you're unhappy? Do you want me to go back and continue being the unappreciated Mrs. Brown, or watch you and Bianca be lovey-dovey every day? Michael,do you find bullying me fun?"



Michael's brow furrowed tightly, and he pulled Isabella close, his voice low, "Don't play this game with me. When have I ever bullied you?"



If this wasn't bullying,then what was?


His grip wasn't light, and Isabella felt a bit of pain.



But it couldn't compare to the pain of the wound in her heart being reopened. Michael was someone she had loved deeply.



Even though she had decided not to like him anymore, her heart's reaction couldn't lie.



She felt like she was suffocating. "You want to know? Then I'll tell you. Three years ago, on our wedding night, Bianca called,and you left without a second thought. Three years later, she returned to the country, and you abandoned me, even ignoring Grandpa's birthday party to find her. When the Taylor Family had trouble, you gave money in her name without a word. Do I need to continue?"



The person he truly cared about was Bianca,not her.



It was the same three years ago, and it hadn't changed three years later.



So,she decided to give up.



The air fell silent. Michael's face was tense, his eyesstormy, "I didn't know marrying me made you feel so wronged, that you even investigated everything I did so clearly. But don't forget, you were the one who came to me with the marriage contract and forced me to marry you1. Wasn't it all voluntary on your part?"



He thought, Now you regret it? Too late.'
###Chapter 8 He Can Get Lost


Isabella's heart tightened, and a sour feeling spread throughout her body.



All these years,what had she been holding on for Michael?



She forcefully shook off his grip, took a step back, and a sarcastic smile appeared on her lips. "You're right, everything was voluntary on my part. So, Mr. Brown, just sign the papers. You go find your lover Bianca, and I'll find my lover. We won't hold each other back,isn't that better?"



Michael stood there quietly, his eyes deeply fixed on her, exuding an imposing aura. "You think hiring Ryan to sue me will work? I told you, as long as I want, you won't get anything from me,Do you want to be Mrs. Brown, or get divorced and end up with nothing?Think it over."



"Since we can't come to an agreement, see you in court." Isabella said no more, took out her phone, and sent a message.
Just as she was about to leave, Michael's voice came from behind.



"All your cards are frozen. Even if you walk out that door, where will you go? With one call, no hotel in Evergreen City will take you in."



Isabella, with her back to him, bit her lip. "Michael. I'd rather sleep on the streets than go home with you."



Her phone rang. She picked it up and said hello, her nose tingling at the familiar voice. "You said you were nearby, why aren't you here yet?"



"Look at the entrance."



Isabella instinctively looked up.



Thomas got out of the car, walking briskly towards her in a sharp suit. "Isabella."



Seeing Thomas,Isabella let down all her defenses, quickly stepped forward, and took his arm without a word.



Thomas patted her head reassuringly.



He asked her what was wrong.



Isabella only said that Michael had frozen her bank cards and she had nowhere to go. Thomas's face changed instantly.



He coldly looked at Michael standing not far away.



Then he took Isabella to the front desk, pulled out a card from his pocket in front of Michael.



"I'll pay for her room." Thomas was full of authority, and the manager didn't dare refuse.



Then he signed and took Isabella away without giving Michael a second glance. Everyone was stunned.



No one expected Thomas to suddenly appear and pay for Isabela's room right in front of Michael.



They thought Thomas and Isabella must be quite close.


MichaeI's eyes were fixed on Isabella and Thomas's intimate posture.



His deep voice was full of pressure, "Ryan, you dare take my divorce case? You are risking your career of so many years."



Michael recongnized Thomas's voice.



It was the voice from the call he made today.


Thomas protected Isabella with his hand, his expression unchanged,and looked at Michael with a cold smile, "You talk tough, but you don't even know who I am. Michael, do you think you can fight me? I'll just assume Isabella watsed her three ye ars on you. As long as I'm here, you won't win this case." With that, he took Isabella and left directly.



The people in the hotel were scared, no one dared to move.


A group of men in black came out of the elevator, the leader walked up to Michael, "Mr. Brown, we've moved him out of the country as you instructed. Without your orders, he won't appear in Evergreen City again."



The car outside sped away, and Michael's face grew darker. "Find out who that person was just now, and who Isabella has been in contact with this past year. I want all the information in an hour."



"Yes, Mr. Brown."



In the car, Isabella and Thomas sat in the back seat. Thomas was both worried and angry,"You dare bring any man into the hotel?Aren't you afraid he might be a scammer?"



Thomas had been worried all the way here. Fortumately, nothing happened, ofherwise. he wouldn'e knot how to explain to Daniel.



Isabella knew Thomas was worrledt tiboat her.so she held Fits arin and carefully explained. "Thomas, you misunderstood. I pald i high price to find that man. His looks and physique are top-noteh, and his education and family background have been checked. The child born would definitely be smart and good-looking."



Unfortunately, Michael ruined it.



"By the way, Thomas, please save that man. He was taken away by Michael."



Michael was ruthless, something might really happen.



"Now you are worried?" Thomas squinted, "Don't worry, he wouldn't dare take a life. At most, he'll teach him a lesson and kick him out. But you, how will you face him if you push him too far?"



Isabella just sighed in relief, but was stunned by his words. "What do you mean?" Thomas said, "Daniel has asked for you and Michael to visit him together, or he won't continue his treatment. You know his wish is to see your child before he dies. If he knows you filed for divorce,he might get furious."



Daniel was known for his bad temper.



Only Isabella, his granddaughter, could manage him. None of his sons dared to go against him.



"Grandpa is throwing a tantrum again. Thomas, why didn't you say earlier?" Thinking of the harsh words she just said, Isabella felt a wave of darkness, "The divorce papers have been sent.How can I bring Michael to see Grandpa?"



"True, I don't that the way he talk." Thomas was also angry just now and couldn't hold back. "Daniel is getting old and his health is deteriorating. The doctor said he can't take too much stress. So,I think it's better to keep the divorce from him for now."



Hearing about Daniel's condition, Isabella felt terrible. She hadn't been able to visit Daniel because she was busy with the Brown Family'sbirthday party.



She could only hear his voice on the phone, not knowing he was just comforting her. "Thomas, I understand. I won't let Grandpa know about this."



Just then, her phone rang



It was Michael's grandfather, Aiden.



Aiden was the only one in the Brown Family who truly caredI for her.



Isabella would never ignore his call,



On the phone, Aiden's voice was gentle and loving, "Isabella,I know you've been wronged and are feeling sad. Come home. Don't worry,you have me."



Isabella's eyes turned red, her voice choked with tears, "Aiden."
"It's not your fault, Isabella." Aiden understood everything. "It's all Michael's fault. Don't worry. I'll always be on your síde. I've already told him, if he dares divorce you, he won't get a penny of the Brown Family's inheritance. He can get lost."



Isabella paused.



No wonder Michael was making things difficult and wouldn't divorce.



It was all for himself.



She had been deluding herself.



But Aiden's support still moved Isabella deeply.



Isabella said, "Aiden, even if I'm not with Michael, I'll still consider you my family. Whenever you want to see me, I'llcome."



"Why not now?" Aiden's voice was sincere,′′I7m really worried about you being out there alone." Kay Cruickshank
I really like this book, it makes not want to put it down
###Chapter 9 Are You Looking for a Fight?


"Aiden, I'm planning to visit my grandpa now. Can I come back later?" Isabella didn't want to hurt Aiden's feelings too much,so she planned to visit when Michael wasn't around.



"Daniel?" Aiden seemed shocked, "Isabella, you didn't tell Daniel about the divorce with Michael, did you?"



"No, Aiden, can you help me keep it from him too? I don't want him to worry." Isabella knew about the close relationship between Aiden and Daniel.



They had known each other since they were young.



The marriage arrangement was made back then.



′′Iwas just about to tell you, Daniel called me." Aiden's tone was tense,"It sounded like he heard something. He insisted I send him a photo of you two together. I told him you two went out to have fun,so he didn't press further. But I have a feeling Daniel will call again tonight. If the truth comes out, I'm really afraid he'll rush over here. Given Daniel's condition, even he didn't dare take the risk.



He instructed the driver to turn back to the Brown Family.



When the car stopped outside the Brown Villa, Isabella asked Thomas to leave.



As soon as she entered. she heard laughter from the hall.



Led by Stella, many wealthy ladies from the circle had gathered.



Isabella immediately noticed two women sitting next to Stella.



Bianca and her mother, Harper, who used to be a mistress.



Harper was wearing a bright red dress, with heavy makeup, looking obsequiously at Stella,talking.



Stella glanced at Bianca, who immediately blushed. As she turned, she saw Isabella coming in from outside.



Bianca's eyes flickered, and she pretended to speak unintentionally."Stella, please don't say that. Michael married Isabella. I can't mess.with Michael now."



"Why not?" Stella had no fondness for Isabella and would be the happiest if they divorced. "Michael liked you back then. If she hadn't insisted on bringing the marriage contract to Mr. Brown, I might have had a grandchild by now. I make the decisions here.Once she divorces, she won't get anything. I'll immediately go to the Taylor Family to arrange the marriage between you and Michael."



As soon as Stella finished speaking, Isabella walked past her without even a glance.



In front of so many people, Isabella didn't show her any respect.



"Stop!" Stella's face changed, and she shouted at Isabella, "You've been out all night. Where have you been messing around? Can't you see who's here? Your mother Harper and your sister Bianca are here, and you don't even notice?" Isabella turned coldly. "My real mother is dead. It would be strange if I saw her."



"You..." Stella got pissed off.



Harper tried to mediate softly, "Mrs. Brown, please don't be angry.Isabella has always misunderstood me. I'm used to it."



"Misunderstood?" Isabella sneered, stopping in her tracks, "Come on, tell me, what misunderstanding could I have about a mistress who climbed up using her body? How dare you call yourself my mother in front of me? You don't deserve it."



In front of outsiders, Harper had to hold back her anger,"It's not like that, Isabella. We heard you and Michael were having issues and wanted to check on you. Indigo misses you too and wants you to come home."



"Which home? The Taylor Family's house that you and your daughter have taken over?"



Isabella's eyes grew colder, "Or have you forgotten how you schemed to drive me out? Now you come to act in front of me.
Harper, even if you don't find it disgusting, I do."



Just five days after Grace's death, her hypocritical father Indigo brought Harper and Bianca, who was about her age,into the Taylor Family.



She was drowning in the grief of losing Grace, and Bianca and Harper seized the opportunity.



If Daniel hadn't taken her away, she might not have survived.



Later, to give Michael a good impression, she married into the Brown Family and had been avoiding any contact with them for three years.



Even when Michael secretly supported the Taylor Family, she endured it.



But now, they had come to act in front of her. Since that was the case, she saw no need to endure any longer. "By the way, the villa you're living in now belongs to my mother. It's time for you to leave."



Hearing this, Harper and Bianca turned pale.



Sitting in thne middle, Stella slammed the table, "You're too much.They are your mother and sister. Is this how you talk to them? You say Harper is a mistress, but do you know that everyone in Evergreen City knows it was Grace who cheated first? She couldn't keep Indigo, so why blame Harper?"



Stella didn't want to see Isabella anymore.



Her bright red nails pointed at Isabella a few feet away,′′Ishouldn't have let Michael marry you. Get out now. Someone, throw her out."



The servants and the butler exchanged glances, remaining still.



Everyone in the Brown Family knew that although Isabella wasn't favored by Michael, she was important to Aiden. Whenever there was something good, Aiden would let Isabella choose first, even before Stella.



Finally, the butler had to step in, "Mrs. Stella Brown, Mr. Brown was just asking about Isabella. If he can't find her later, he might get angry."



Stella's face turned even uglier.



Because she didn't dare to go against Aiden either.



Bianca stepped forward,"Mrs. Stella Brown, this is how Isabellas is.Please don't be angry with her because of me and my mother.How about I apologize to Isabella and see if I can calm her down?"



Hearing this, Stella's anger flared up even more. "She doesn't deserve your apology. Does she think she can compare to you?"



Bianca smiled awkwardly and walked towards Isabella.



When she was just a step away, she whispered so only the two of them could heat, "Isabella. I really admire you. Three years of a sexless marriage, plus the whole family being harsh to you, and you still managed to hold on. But Michael loves me, nof you.Staying here only makes you an eyesore."



Isabella's voice was icy, "Are you looking for a fight?"



Bianca raised an eyebrow, "I don't believe you dare to hit mein front of everyone."



Just then Bianca's head was turned to the side by a slap, and before she could react, another loud slap followed.



"Didn't you think I wouldn't dare to hit you? Want now?"



Bianca's face swelled from the slaps, and facing Isabella's imposing aura, she instinctively stepped back.



She didn't know what she bumped into, but when she looked up,she saw Michael standing right in front of her.
###Chapter 10 What Explanation Do I Owe Her?


"Michael." Bianca saw Michael, and tears immediately welled up in her eyes. She looked so pitiful that anyone would think she had suffered a great injustice.



She wanted to take the opportunity to snuggle up to him, but Michael called the butler over to avoid her approach.



He casually handed over his coat.



Every move he made exuded the aura and dignity of an heir.


Isabella also turned her gaze to Michael.



Michael's deep, cold eyes lifted slightly, a chilling frost in them that sent shivers down one's spine.



The entre hall fell silent in an instant. Everyone was waiting to see how Michael would deal with Isabella.



Only Isabella herself remained the calmest of all.



When Bianca deliberately walked over to provoke her, she had already heard the sound of a car entering the yard outside



Those two slaps were not only something Bianca asked for but also something she specifically did for Michael to see.



Michael walked towards Isabella with a stern face.



Bianca took two steps forward without making a sound,just enough to show the slap marks on her face to Michael.



Michael frowned unconsciously.



Bianca thoughat he was feeling sorry for her and couldn't wait to teach Isabella a lesson. She put on her act, wiping her tears and pleading for Isabella,
"Michael.Isabella didn't mean it. She might have misunderstood me.so don't blame her."



But Michael squinted his eyes at her. "What are you doing here?"



His icy tone carried no emotion, and not only was Bianca stunned,but even the people around didn't expect Michael to say that.



After all, it was no secret within the circle that Michael liked Bianca.



Even Stella had come out to confirm it.



Logically, he should be on Bianca's side, kicking Isabella out of the house.



Bianca's face changed slightly, unsure if Michael was genuinely unwelcoming or just saying.



She then lowered her head, biting her lip, and replied,"Mrs. Brown invited my mom over, and I came along." Michael's gaze swept across the hall, and his face darkened further when he saw Harper.



His voice grew colder. "Why did you deliberately seek her out?"



Bianca thought she had misheard, looking at Michael with even redder eyes, "Michael, it's not like that. I didn't do anything to Isabella. It was Isabella who hit me first. You saw it just now.I didn't even have a chance to fight back. It was all Isabella hitting me."



Isabella had no interest in watching their act and didn't even look at Michael.



She walked straight through the living room to Aiden's place.


Seeing that Isabella didn't even have him in her eyes, Michael's face darkened, "Isabella, who allowed you to leave?"



Isabella knew what Michael wanted to do by keeping her. It was nothing more than to back up his Bianca and make her apologize to Bianca. He shouldn't even think about it.



She didn't come back for him; she came back to keep Aiden from being sad and to calm Daniel.



Her time wasn't meant to be wasted on these people.



Isabella left the hall without looking back.



The veins on Michael's forehead bulged, and he pursed his lips,about to chase after her. "Stop."



Seeing Michael about to chase after Isabella, Stella's face turned dark, "Come here, I have something important to tell you."



"What is it?" Feeling increasingly agitated, Michael casually unbuttoned the top two buttons of his black shirt, his Adam's apple moving up and down.


 
The sexy curve made Bianca, standing nearby, stare in a daze. Stella's face was cold, "What do you mean, what is it? Are you going to let Bianca suffer this grievance for nothing? If you don'E stand up for her, then I will. I'm telling you, I can't stand Isabella for another minute. If you two are going to divorce, do it quickly. Don't waste time."


Michael's face remained calm, but he felt a faint annoyance inside.
"Whether we divorce or not is between me and her. Don't interfere."



Seeing that Michael wasn't getting to the point, Stella felt  something was wrong, "So, are you planning to divorce or not? When are you going to handle it? And the news about you celebrating Bianca's birthday last night has spread in the circle. Aren't you going to give her an explanation?"



Michael's eyes darkened, "What explanation do I owe her?"


Stella thought he was deliberately provoking and smiled at Bianca,"Of course, it's about your marriage." Michael's cold gaze fell on her, and Bianca's body trembled.



She softly called out, "Michael..."



"You should call me Mr. Brown." Michael didn't hold back his aura.and the pressure was intense even when he wasn't speaking.



Bianca's heart trembled, not daring to look directly at Michael.



Last night, she had indeed spread the news that Michael had come specifically to celebrate her birthday and had secretly sent the photos to Isabella's phone.



She hadn't mentioned anything else.



It was the people present who helped her spread the word.



She hadn't expected Isabella to actually come and make such a scene. The rumors that spread were exactly what she wanted.



Only if Isabella and Michael divorced would she have a chance to marry into the Brown Family and become the high and mighty Mrs. Brown.



But now, she couldn't lose her image in front of Michael.



She bit her lip, tears in her eyes, and approached Michael, "Michael,are you unhappy because I came here? I really didn't mean to.Hf you don't want to see me, I'll leave right now."



Saying this, Bianca was about to leave.



Stella stopped her, turning to glare at Michael, "If you dare to kick Bianca out, believe me, I'll turn against you. Do you think you'd still be standing here if Bianca hadn't saved you back then?"



Thinking of the past, Michael's expression softened slightly.



Seeing this, Bianca cautiously tugged at his clothes,′′Don't be angry.
I know it's my fault. You should go find Isabella. Shemight be waitinng for you. I'm fine."



She thought this would make Michael feel even more sorry for her.



But to her surprise, Michael turned around and went straight to the backyard, leaving her without hesitationto find Isabella.



Bianca's nails almost dug into her palms to keep from showing any sign of losing her composure.



Seeing this, Stella felt even more sorry for Bianca, "Bianca,I managed to keep him here, and you pushed him to Isabella. Those two slaps are for nothing now."



Bianca forced a smile, "It's okay, Mrs. Brown. As long as Michael is happy, I don't mind suffering a little."



Hearing this, Stella was even more convinced that Bianca was the wife she wanted for Michael.Obedient and sensible, far better than that country bumpkin Isabella who didn't understand any rules.



"Bianca, trust me. As long as they divorce. I'll make sure you marry into the Brown Family and become Michael's wife."



Bianca's face remained calm, but she was extremely excited inside."I'll listen to you."



Michael arrived at Aiden's place but didn't see him in the living room.



He walked upstairs and faintly heard Isabella and Aiden talking in the study.



He slowly approached, leaning against the outer wall of the study,not feeling that his behavior was wrong at all.
###Chapter 11 The Heir's Identity Given to Isabella
In the room, Isabella was talking to Aiden, "I'm back. I'm sorry for making you worry."



Aiden felt sorry for her, "I know all about you and Michael. I know all the terrible things Michael has done. You've been wronged all these years and had to endure it for the greater good. I should be the one apologizing to you."



Isabella shook her head, not wanting to upset Aiden further,so she didn't explain more.



Seeing Isabella remain silent, Aiden felt even more distressed,"Isabella, don't worry. In this family, my word stilI counts.The marriage agreement was between you and Michael. No one else is either qualified or worthy."



Isabella didn't need to think to know who he referred to. The commotion in the hall was intense; Aiden must have just heard about it.



Isabella felt a pang in her heart. Besides Daniel, only Aiden truly cared for her.



However,her divorce case with Michael was already settled.



She could only appreciate Aiden's kindness.



Just as she was about to explain, Aiden suddenly said, "Isabella, I plan to hand over the Brown Family's inheritance to you. Anyway.Michael insists on divorcing you. Our family doesn't need someone as unfaithful as him. When you take charge of the Brown Family,divorce means he gets nothing. Let's see if he still dares to divorce you."



Only Aiden knew Isabella's true identity in the entire Brown Family.



Daniel's beloved granddaughter, also a young lady of the Wilson Family, was exceptionally smart and beautiful. If it weren't for him, Michael might hot have married such a good wife as Isabella.



Yet, with Isabella by his side, Michael didn't know how to cherish her, causing her to suffer greatly in the Brown Family.



If they divorced, he would feel the most guilty.



Isabella was stunned.



She almost thought she had misheard.



Aiden wanted to hand over the entire Brown Family's inheritance to her!



Wasn't he worried she might cause chaos in the Brown Group to get back at Michael?



Aiden had so much trust in her that he was willing to give her his hard-earned business as compensation. In contrast, that bastard Michael froze all her bank cards as soon as he heard she wanted a share of his assets.



They were both from the Brown Family, yet the difference was so stark.



But she knew this was between her and Michael.



Even if they divorced, the money should come from Michael,from his independent company assets, not Aiden's lifelong business.



Michael should be the one to pay.



"Aiden, about the inheritance..." Just as she was about to refuse, the door was suddenly pushed open from the outside.



A cold voice broke the conversation inside the room, "I disagree!"



Michael's tall figure appeared in the room, his eyes briefly glancing at Isabella's small face before walking straight to Aiden. His words were as cold as ice, "Grandpa. How could the Brown Family's business be handed over to Isabella, especially when she's about to divorce me?"



Turning to Isabella, Michael's every word hurt her dearly, "Isabella.I underestimated you. Since you can't get money from me, you're trying to get it from Grandpa, right?"


No wonder she came back.



He thought she came back for something else, but it turned out money was more important to her than anything else.



Isabella was heartbroken.



The explanation on her lips turned into a cold smile. She now fully understood the feeling of misplaced trust.



She had been his wife for three years, yet in his eyes, she was just an outsider who only cared about money. Aiden, hearing this, almost fainted from ánger.



He swung his tightly gripped cane at Michael.



Michael didn't dodge, taking the hit head-on.



Instead, Aiden almost sprained his back, and Isabella stepped forward to support him.



Michael reached out his hand but withdrew it when he saw Isabella.



Aiden sat in the chair, pointing at Michael and cursing, "You bastard, are you trying to piss me off? Do you forget what you promised when Isabella married you? How could you say such things to her? I'm ashamed of you."



Michael's deep gaze fell on Isabella,full of confusion.



How did she manage to charm Aiden into being willing to give her the family business? Aiden said. "Why are you staring at Isabella? Let me tell you, if you and Isabella don't have a child soon. I'll have a lawyer draft a contract to hand everything in the Brown Family over to Isabella.You were out all night last night, and today you dare to bring someone else home to upset Isabella. Do you think no one in this family can control you? I want to see who you are to Isabella without the inheritance."



Aiden's scolding, especially in front of Isabella, made Michael's face turn extremely dark.



He stood there quietly, his cold gaze fixed on Isabella, exuding a strong sense of oppression.



Seeing this, Isabella felt much better.



Having someone to back her up gave her confidence.


She could already imagine that if she took over the entire Brown Family, Michael and Stella would have to listen to her.



They would have to report everything to her without a hint of complaint or disrespect.



Just thinking about it made her feel satisfied.


This matter had been mentioned before. Aiden and Daniel, feeling they were getting old, wanted her and Michael to take over the two families' companies and create a brilliant future together.



But they didn't expect that before taking over the companies, the two would reach the point of divorce.



Seeing Isabella lower her head, lost in thought, Aiden made the decision directly. "This matter is settled. Isabella, I'm not joking.Stay at home for the next few days. Once I handle this,I'll announce your inheritance."



Isabella didn't expect Aiden to be serious.



Aiden raised his eyebrows, deliberately lowering his voice,"Ifyou don't agree, I'll tell Michael about our agreement." Isabella didn't want Michael to know her true identity.



In the past three years, if he had cared a bit more, he would have noticed something.



Now, as they were about to divorce, she didn't want to cause more trouble.



She just wanted to end things properly and live her own life.



But looking at Michael's changing expression and thinking about Bianca's dreamn of marrying into the Brown Family, Isabella suddenly wanted to laugh. Her beautiful eyes lifted slightly,looking at Michael with a clear provocation, "I'll accept it."
###Chapter 12 Shouldn't I Have a Baby with You?
Michael's lips curled into a cold smile upon hearing this. He looked at her sharply, not saying a word, but exuding a deadly sense of oppression.



Isabella wasn't scared at all and met his gaze directly.



Silent sparks flew between their eyes.



Isabella's calmness made Michael's face even darker.



At this moment, Isabella's phone rang



It was a video call from Daniel.



Daniel couldn't wait until the evening and had already called to check in. Isabella truly believed that Daniel might have sensed something.



Aiden, who was beside her, saw who was calling at a glance.


He looked at Michael, who was still standing there, then at Isabella beside him, his eyes flickering, "Isabella, it's Daniel calling. You should answer, or he'll get suspicious again."



Isabella felt a sudden tension in her heart.



She came back today to hide her intention to divorce from Daniel with Aiden's help.



But who would have thought Michael would return at this time?


If she didn't answer now, she feared Daniel would overthink.



She had no choice but to answer the call.



As soon as the call connected, Daniel's loving face appeared on the
screen. "Isabella, what are you doing? You don't even have time to answer my call?"



Feeling guilty. Isabella pointed the phone at herself and Aiden.Facing Daniel, her voice softened. "I'm with Aiden. How are you.Grandpa? I miss you."



Daniel and Aiden were both eager for them to have children. She had been so preoccupied with fighting Michael that she hadn't spoken to Daniel in a long time.



Especially since she was hiding her divorce from Daniel, she felt even more guilty.



"I miss you too. How long have you been married? You promised to bring Michael to see me, but I haven't seen either of you. Do you think I'm easy to fool?" Daniel's dissatisfaction was genuine.



Once a legendary figure who could shake the business world with a word,Daniel now had to feign anger in front of Isabella.



Grace died early, and his sons were not yet married. He only had Isabella as his granddaughter.



He cherished her dearly, afraid she would be wronged in any way.Now that she was married, as long as she was happy, he was content.



"Daniel. Don't worry. Isabella is now married into the Brown Family. Don't think about taking her away from me." Aiden was afraid that if he wasn't careful, Isabella would be taken away.



Daniel and Aiden were old friends, a relationship only Michael was unaware of.



Besides, he never cared about anything related to Isabella.



Seeing the three of them chatting and laughing on the phone,treating him like air, Michael felt an indescribable discomfort.



He remembered that Isabella's grandfather Daniel was supposed to be farming in the countryside. How did he become so familiar with Aiden? But one thing Michael didn't miss.



When Daniel mentioned his name earlier, Isabella deliberately changed the subject. and Aiden helped her cover it up.



Michael felt something was off.



To confirm his suspicions, he casually picked up the cane Aiden had thrown earlier and walked over to place it by the chair. "'Grandpa,here's your cane."



As he spoke, he moved closer to Isabella, his slightly open collar revealing his sexy collarbone and muscular chest.



With Michael's face and body proportions, he was eye-catching anywhere.



Isabella squinted her eyes.



After three years of being with him, how could she not see that he was doing it on purpose? If it weren't for Daniel on the other end of the phone,she would have kicked Michael away long ago.



On the other end, Daniel immediately noticed Michael's fleeting presence beside Isabella.



′′Iss that Michael?" Daniel's tone was surprised, as it was his first time seeing Michael in person.



Isabella's eyebrows tightened, just about to stop him from speaking but Michael sat down right next to her.



He adjusted his posture to accommodate her, with half of his shoulder tightly against hers, as if afraid she would get tired. He held her phone higher with his hand.



They were so close that when Isabella looked down, she saw Michael's chest muscles.



Michael's unique scent overwhelmed her, and Isabella's face couldn't help but heat up. She instinctively turned away, only to find her lips brushing against his Adam's apple.



Isabella's mind went blank.



Her flushed face turned even redder, her heart pounding wildly.



But Michael remained completely unfazed. She was sure she had touched him.



How could he be so calm?



Then again, he never had feelings for her.



He liked Bianca.



Isabella closed her eyes, suppressing the discomfort in her heart. If it weren't for the fear of Daniel overthinking, she would have pushed him away and left. But Michael acted as if nothing had happened, leaning against her and greeting Daniel on the phone.



"Daniel, I'm Michael. Isabella often talks about you. It's my fault for not visiting you in person. How about we come see you tomorrow?"



On the other end, Daniel sat in his living room, exuding a powerful aura, his sharp and stern features far from those of a countryside farmer.



Seeing Isabella and Michael snuggled up together, Daniel couldn't be happier. "Good. If you can come, I'll be overjoyed. It's our first meeting, and I have something for you as a wedding gift."



Isabella's heart skipped a beat. Daniel was always generous,and since he mentioned a wedding gift, it was likely something valuable.



She couldn't let Michael take advantage of this. "Grandpa, it's our duty to visit you. There's no need for gifts. Please keep your things;it's too much trouble."



"We're all family. What's wrong with giving a gift? But you two
need to hurry up. It's been so long, and there's still no good news.
Next time I call, I want to hear that you're expecting a child."



"Alright, we'll do as you say." Michael lowered his head, giving Isabella a deep look, and agreed decisively.



Isabella's eyes widened, and she nudged him with her shoulder.



He was crazy.



What was he saying in front of Daniel?



They were already divorced. Who would have a child with him?



Isabella used quite a bit of force, but Michael didn't seem to feel any pain. Instead, he reached out to rub her shoulder, his voice low,
"What, are you shy about having a child?"



Isabella's face turned bright red, not wanting to reveal anything in front of Daniel and Aiden, She gritted her teeth and said, "Michael, take your hand off."



Michael pretended not to understand, "You bumped into me first.Shouldn't you apologize instead of being so self-righteous?"



Isabella said, "Mind what you say."



He leaned closer to her ear, "What did I say? Shouldn't I havre a child with you?"
###Chapter 13 If You Want to Leave, Take That Off Too
The way the two of them were talking with their heads down clearly showed they were a loving couple.



But to Daniel, something seemed off."Isabella, Michael is right.You've been married for three years now; it's time to have a child of your own. Or are you just wanting to play around for a few more years and deliberately not having one?"



Isabella bit her lip, feeling extremely wronged, but she couldn't say anything in front of Daniel.



If she said it was Michael who didn't want kids, Daniel's sharp mind would definitely figure out something was wrong between them.



If she said she didn't want kids, Daniel wouldn't believe it.



After all, she had willingly married Michael back then. She loved
Michael so much. and it didn't make sense that they hadn't hadáchild in three years.



No matter what she said, it would be wrong. Isabella was so anxious that her eyes were about to turn red.



At that moment, Michael spoke up for her, "Daniel, it's not Isabella's fault. I wanted us to have some time alone first, so we didn't plan for a child early on."



"You young people are just too laid-back. It's been three years;it's time to have a child and settle down." Daniel said earnestly.



The misunderstanding was cleared up.



′′Iunderstand. We'll have a child. Just wait and see." Isabella tried her best not to let Daniel see anything amiss and quickly agreed.



As for whether it would be Michael's child, that was uncertain.



Hearing Isabella say it herself, Daniel was overjoyed, "Good,you
said it. I'llbe waiting for the good news."



"Yes. Grandpa, take care of your health. Don't overwork yourself.Fl come to visit you." After a few more words to appease Daniel.Isabella finally hung up the phone.



The next second, she stood up and glared at Michael, "Michael, did you do that on purpose?"



Michael's expression didn't change. He straightened his clothes and said leisurely, "What did I do? I was just chatting with you and Daniel. You didn't like it?"



Isabella was so angry she gritted her teeth, not wanting to say more.She greeted Aiden and turned to leave.



She didn't even look at Michael.



Michael wanted to follow her, but Aiden stopped him. "Where are you going?"
Michael paused, his tall figure turning around, exuding an air of mischief, "Grandpa, didn't you scold me enough juse now?"



Aiden said angrily, "Let me tell you, if it weren't for Isabella's family being in trouble back then, do you think you could have married her? Three years of marriage, and you haven't even visited Isabella's relatives. Is this how you treat your wife?"



Michael's face turned cold. "That's none of your business. I have my own ways."



Aiden snorted, "You just talk. Isabella has been staying at home for you these past few years, losing her own life. And you? Playing around outside all the time, not doing anything good. By the wray go and get rid of that woman and her daughter outside. Isabella doesn't want to see them. Don't affect her mood."



Michael said nothing, his face dark.



After a moment, he looked up at Aiden and said calmly, "Isabella's grandpa, Daniel, don't you have anything to tell me about him?"
There were rumors that after Isabella left the Taylor Family. she was taken to a remote countryside, living with Daniel.



But the Daniel he just saw in the video was clearly more imposing than Aiden, with an arrogance and dominance that ordinary people couldn't possess.



It was impossible to associate him with an old farmer.



Aiden and Isabella must be hiding something from him.



Aiden wasn't afraid at all. Sittingin the chair behind the desk, he raised an eyebrow, "What do I have to say to you? That's Isabella's grandpa. You should have taken gifts to visit him. It's you fault if you don't know him?"



Michael's face darkened.



Just as he was about to leave, Aiden reminded him, "Michael, I've done everything I can for you. If you still can't keep Isabella, that's your own problem. And don't forget what you promised Isabella just now. Daniel is her closest family."Michael frowned. "You don't need to worry. I understand."



With that, he left.



On the other side.



Isabella returned to their marital home and immediately started packing her things.



In three years of marriage, she had lived in this room alone.



She used to buy flowers and decorations to make the place look nice,hoping it would lift his spirits when he came home.



But he never cared about this place



She got tired.



A one-sided marriage was too boring. She wanted to leave.
After packing the last item. Isabella grabbed her suitcase and was about to leave.



Suddenly a cold, bone-chilling voice sounded behind her, "Where are you going?"



Isabella turned around to see Michael standing there with a cold expression.



She calmed down,"Do I need to report to you where I'm going?Don't forget our relationship."



"If you want to leave, leave the things behind." Michael walked over step by step, his tall figure almost enveloping her.



She had changed clothes, wearing a burgundy fitted long dress that perfectly showcased her beautiful figure, with her exposed skin looking delicate.



Isabella understood his meaning and sneered, "These are my personal belongings. Why can't I take them?" "What if there's something from the Brown Family hidden inside?"



Michael was cold and unreasonable.



Isabella's chest heaved with anger. She immediately opened the suitcase for him to see,′′Fine,check it yourself. See if there's anything hidden from the Brown Family?"



Michael really came over to check.



His fingers picked up a ruby ring from the suitcase, his lips curling without a trace of emotion,"II'm not mistaken, this was worn by Grandma when she was young."



"That was a birthday gift from Aiden. What does it have to dlo with the Brown Family?" Isabella tried to snatch it back, but she wasn't tall enough. Michael raised his hand slightly, and she almost fell onto him.



She had wanted to keep it as a memento, but ifhe wwanted it,he could have it. "Not just the ring. The clothes you're wearing. the jewelry. the branded bags in the closet, all bought with money from my card Do you think you can take them without my permission?"



Isabella saw through Michael.



She could only see his true colors when it came to divorce.



He even wanted to count the money spent on clothes?



Biting her lip, Isabella decided to leave the suitcase behind, "Since it's all the Brown Family's money, I don't want it anymore."



Isabella pushed Michael aside and was about to leave, but he grabbed her wrist tightly, his eyes darkening,′′Ifyou want to leave,take off the clothes you're wearing too!"



Isabella couldn't believe what she was hearing.



Michael meant that if she wanted to leave, she could only do so naked."Michael, say that again!" Isabella's face turned pale with anger.
Both of them were furious, and neither was willing to back down.



Neither was willing to be the one to lower their head.



Bianca was just downstairs. He was deliberately trying to embarrass her.



This wasn't just making things difficult for her; it was a complete humiliation.
###Chapter 14 What is your relationship with that man named Thomas?

He chased her from Aiden's place to the bedroom. Wasn't he just trying to stand up for Bianca?



Just because she slapped Bianca twice, he felt so bad that he wanted to get back at her.



If he liked Bianca so much, why did he agree to marry Isabella in the first place?



Isabella's eyes turned cold, her face indifferent. "If I take off my clothes, will you let me go?"



Michael's face instantly darkened at her words.



He was betting that Isabella wouldn't really go through with it.



His jaw tightened."Isn't taking off your clothes easy for you? Every nightI came over, weren't you seducing me like this?" Isabella released her tightly bitten lips. "Fine, let go of me.and Tll take them off!"



Michael's eyes flickered, and he stared at Isabella's expression as if trying to see through her.



He let her go.



He knew how strong her pride was. With Harper and Bianca downstairs, she couldn't possibly walk out like this.



But the next second, Isabella tore off her long dress right in front of him.



The zipper broke.



From top to bottom, her body was exposed to him almost instantly.



Her breasts, tightly wrapped in a bra, bounced with her violent movements. Below was a pair of lace-trimmed panties, matching her smooth.slender legs.



From Michael's angle, he could even see her buttocks. perky and eye-catching.



Isabella's face turned pale, she could see Michael's gaze.



But the little fabric left on her was her last line of defense; she couldn't take off any more.



"Enough? It's all yours!" She threw the dress into Michael's arms,turned around, and started to walk out barefoot.



Her sweet scent hit his nose as Isabella was about to walk out the door like this.



Michael was going crazy.


 
She really dared. His face darkened, and he strode forward, grabbing her just as she was about to open the door, pinning her againse the wall. "You don't even care about your dignity?"



His hot breath fell on her, as if it would burn a hole in her.


Isabella struggled in his arms. "Michael, get off me. Don't forget what you just promised me. I've taken off my clothes. What more do you want?"



The more she struggled, the tighter his hand gripped her waist.



Isabella couldn't break free and was furious.′′Do you want me to take off these two pieces of underwear too? Would that make you happy? Michael, after three years of marriage, I didn't expect you to be such a bastard."



Michael's face was far from pleasant. She was almost completely exposed, rubbing against him, as if he had extraordinary self-control.



He pushed Isabella away slightly and picked a long coat from the
scattered clothes to cover her. "If you want to leave. I won'e stop you. But think it through. Once you leave the Brown Family.
everything GrandIpa said to you will be null and vofd."



Isabella clutched the coat tightly, her face flushed with anger. "That was Aidenn's gift to me. What right do you have to make decisions for him? I am determined to get the Brown Family's property."



Michael's face turned cold as he stood there, staring at her."H you want the Brown Family's money, fine. Continue being my wife, and don't ever think about leaving me."



"Impossible!" Isabella raised her head like an unyielding swan



Michael squinted his eyes, his tone cold. "Then don't think about taking any money from me."



Isabella wanted to take his money to support another man.She shouldn't even think about it.



Isabella zipped up the coat. "Then see you in divorce court. Let's see whose legal team is better." She trusted Thomas's people.



Mentioning the legal team, Michael's eyes changed. and a fre of anger ignited in his chest.



He took two steps forward, cornering her. "Tell me, what's your relationship with that man named Thomas?"



Isabella was startled but quickly realized.



With Michael's abilities, it was impossible for him not to investigate Thomas.



Unfortunately, no matter how hard he tried, he wouldn't find anything.



Looking at the furious Michael in front of her, Isabella curled her lips and sneered."What does it have to do with you?"



Michael grabbed her chin, forcing her to look at him."He flew over to fight a divorce case for you. Are you saying there's nothing between you two? Or have you aIready slept with him?"



"Michael, you bastard." Isabella was emotional, trying to push him away, but Michael didn't budge.



Instead, he grabbed her waist, trying to pull her into his arms.


Isabella didn't give him the chance.



She stomped hard on his foot.



She was wearing high heels.



The pain was unimaginable.



Michael's face changed instantly.



Isabella didn't care about him, grabbed her things, and quickly left.



Michael actually slandered her. He entangled with Bianca, and now he dared to bully her.



She was determined to end this marriage.



Isabella didn't care about Michael anymore.



Meanwhile, in the living room downstairs.



Harper and Bianca hadn't left yet and were chatting with Stella.



Bianca kept her head down, answering everything, making Stella like her even more.



She held Bianca's hand, sighing that Michael had chosen the wrong person. If Bianca had married Michael, it would have been a hundred times better than Isabella, who never pleased her.



Maybe she would have had a grandchild by now.
When Isabella came downstairs in a coat, she was immediately seen
by Bianca and her stepmother. Harper.



Harper immediately noticed something was wrong with Isabella.



Isabella's face was flushed, her hair slightly messy, and there was a hint of charm in her eyes...



They probably weren't arguing upstairs but doing something more suggestive.



Pretending not to notice, Harper deliberately spoke up to draw attention. "Isabella. Why are your eyes red? Did you just have a fight with Michael?"



Harper pretended to be concerned but was actually trying to make things worse.



Isabella couldn't be bothered with Harper and didn't even look at her.



But Harper wouldn't let it go.′′It2Ss okay if you had a fight. Aren't
you divorcing MAichael? Do you have anywhere to go? Do you want to come home with us?"



When Isabella was kicked out of the Taylor Family, she was only a teenager. For so many years, Indigo never said a word about letting her come back. Isabella was just an unwanted orphan. What was she so proud of?



Bianca was the one who was pampered and raised as the Taylor Family's young lady.



Bianca was the one who deserved such wealth and luxury.



Why should all the good things go to Isabella?



Harper clung to her, and Isabella coldly watched her act.



Seeing Isabella not responding, Harper became more smug,thinking she was really kicked out by Michael. "There aren't many rooms at home,but we can have the maid prepare one. It's better than you going back to the countryside. But the room you used to stay in has been taken by Bianca. You are her sister. You wouldn't mind, right?"
###Chapter 15 Initiating Trouble


Harper just wanted Isabella to know that now the Taylor Family was under her control.



There was no place for Isabella anymore.



Harper humiliated her in public over the house, and Isabella wished she could tear off Harper's hypocritical face.



But she restrained herself.



Harper was waiting for her to make a move and cause a scene.



Isabella carried her suitcase and walked down the stairs step by step,standing coldly in front of Harper. "Are you getting tooold and losing your mind? I said that house belongs to my mother,Grace. In a few days, I will personally take it back, and if anything my mom left is missing, I will make you pay a hundredfold."



Previously, her attention was all on Michael. She didn't want Daniel to hear anything that would cause him distress, so she rarely inquired about the Taylor Family.



But now, Harper had provoked her.



She had no reason to endure it any longer.



Hearing Isabella mention the house again, Bianca quíckly came over to pull Harper away.



She pretended to mediate but actually fanned the flames, "Mom,Isabella has been in a bad mood lately, so don't push her anymore.If Isabella really wants to come home, I can give up my room for her."



Isabella sneered, her gaze falling on Bianca'sswollen face, her voice cold and oppressive, "What, those two slaps earlier weren't enough to teach you a lesson, and you still dare to talk nonsense in front of me."



Bianca's face turned pale, and she put on a pitiful loo k in front of others, "Isabella, I didn't." Isabella was tired of their act, "Bianca, don't get too complacent.
Even if I divorce Michael. you 'll never be Mrs. Brown."



"You, what do you mean by that?" Bianca panicked and grabbed Isabella,who was about to leave.



It was then that Bianca noticed that under Isabella's coat,she was only wearing lingerie, revealing a patch of bare skin, and there was an unintentional allure in Isabella's eyes.



Michael was still upstairs and hadn't come down.



What had they just done?



Bianca connected the dots, her face tightening. She couldn't believe it



Seeing Bianca's expression, Isabella understood immediately.She lowered her head and retaliated harshly, "Even if Michael treats you differently, so what? You two will never be together openly. Don't even think about it in this lifetime." "What are you going to do?" A vicious look flashing hr Biance's eyes as she tried to tear off isabella's clothes in public.



Isabella had already seen through her and yanked her clothes back.throwing Bianca aside. "You want to know what I'm going to do?Just wait and see."



With that, Isabella grabbed her luggage and left without a moment's hesitation.



Her high heels and black coat made her more eye-catching.



Stella, seeing Isabella finally leave, felt a weight lifted off her shoulders and went to pull the stunned Bianca, "She's just a lunatic.Why bother with her? She's been married to Michael for three years and hasn't had a child, I've never liked her. But Bianca, you're different. You're the one I see as Michael's wife. Michael likes you too. Maybe he'll propose to you soon."



Bianca was a bit dazed, and Harper quickly chimed in, "Yes, Bianca,with Mrs. Brown backing you, what are you afraid of? Michael hasn't come down yet, probably because he's upset. He listens to you the most. You should go check on him." Harper gave Bianca a look as she spoke.



Bianca snapped back to reality. Isabella's demeanor earlier didn't seem like nothing had happened.



She wanted to know if Michael had really slept with Isabella. "Mrs.Brown..."



"Alright, I uinderstand. Go ahead. I won't let anyone disturb you."



With permission, Bianca quickly went upstairs.



Michael and Isabella's bedroom was easy to recognize; it was the only door on the second floor with a different color.



Bianca carefully knocked on the door, about to call out, when Michael's deep, irritable voice came through."Get out!"



Bianca trembled but couldn't bear to leave.′′Mchael, it's me.
Isabella has already left. I know you're upset right now. Can I come
in and see you?" Her voice was soft and pleading.


However, Michael inside didn't respond to her. He got up and walked to the window, seeing Isabella leaving decisively with her things through the floor-to-ceiling window.



Michael's eyes grew darker.



When Isabella decisively took off her clothes, he had no doubt she was determined to leave.



Outside, not getting a response, Bianca carefully turned the doorknob, finding it unlocked, and slipped inside.



The room was a mess.



Isabella's clothes, jewelry, and some small trinkets were scattered everywhere.



Michael was tall, standing by the window, and Bianca couldn't see his expression, only his broad, stern back. Just standing there, he was like a king looking downon his kindoni.



Bianca was infatuated with his noble and aloof demeanor.



She was willing to do anything to marry him.


She instinctively wanted to get closer to Michael, but as soon as she took a step, Michael's gaze swept over.



There was no emotion in his eyes, but he exuded an aura of dominance that ignored everything.



It made the air around them feel thin.



He spoke coldly, as if addressing someone insignificant, "I didn't let you in. Get out."



Bianca froze, biting her lip hard.



She thought that after the argument earlier, Michael would be
extremely annoyed with Isabella. Why could Isabella still easily affect his emotions even after leaving?



And the white dress on the bed was the one Isabella was wearing when she came back.



She had changed her clothes in front of Michael, stripping down to her lingerie.



Bianca wished she could be the one doing all that.



To stand by Michael's side, letting everyone know she was his wife.



But Bianca also knew Michael's coldness and boundaries. She could make small mistakes, but she couldn't cross his line.



She couldn't panic. As long as they divorced, the position of Mrs.Brown would be hers.



Thinking this, she softened her tone, trembling slightly,′′MLichael,if you don't like it, I won't bother you. But if you need someone to
k to, l'll always be here."



Michael turned around without saying a word.



Bianca bit her lip, knowing that staying any longer wouldn't help.so she left.



As soon as the door closed. Michael's phone rang.



Ethan called to ask about the situation, "Michael, how's it going?Did you really catch someone?"



Michael,frustrated by Isabella's departure, didn't want to deal with it, "Mind your own business."



Just as he was about to hang up, Ethan stopped him, "Why are you in such a hurry to hang up? I know you're upset right now. What's the point of staying home? How about come out for a drink?"



Michael stared at the white dress on the bed, his eyes deep,"Where?" "The Velvet Lounge."
###Chapter 16 How Could She Be Here?


Meanwhile. Isabella got into the car and was about to contact her people when she suddenly received a call.



It was her friend, Olivia Smith.



When she was brought back to the countryside by Daniel, she met Olivia, who was there for a summer retreat. They were of similar age and shared common interests, quickly becoming good friends.



Later,she married Michael with the marriage contract, while Olivia entered the entertainment industry and became a popular star.



Although they hadn't seen each other much over the years due to various reasons, their relationship hadn't grown distant.



Olivia knew a bit about her situation.



As soon as she answered the call, Olivia's angry voice came through."Isabella, I heard about what happened last night. How dare Michael treat you like that? He doesn't even deserve you. It's outrageous."



Isabella was about to speak, but Olivia couldn't hold back and started cursing Michael.



"No way, the more I think about it, the angrier I get. The Brown Family thinks they can do whatever they want just because they're rich. Michael cheats on you and doesn't let you see other man? Who does he think he is? If he doesn't allow it, we'll do it just to spite him!"



Isabella was taken aback.



Was it really necessary to get back at Michael like this?



However, hearing Olivia's rant, Isabella's anger towards Michael dissipated quite a bit.



After saying all this, Olivia realized Isabella hadn't said anything yet and quickly asked, "Isabella, where are you? I've pushed back all my schedules. Tonight, leave everything to me. I guarantee you'll be
satisfied."


"What will satisfy me?" Isabella finally got a word in.



"Of course,celebrating you getting out of that awful Brown Family.Being single has its perks. Tonight, I'll have a dozen different male models to keep you company. You'll forget all about Michael and be surrounded by young, handsome men. Nine o'clock, The Velvet Lounge.See you there."



Olivia hung up the phone.



Isabella held her phone, a look of helplessness in her eyes.



Olivia's temper hadn't changed a bit. If she didn't show up, Olivia would probably be at her doorstep first thing in the morning



But the feeling of not being restricted was indeed liberating.



She no longer had to stay in that empty house waiting for Michael to come back. Nor did she have to hope every day that he would like her a little more.



Indeed, the people one liked when young would change as one grew up.



It was time for her to let go.


At night, The Velvet Lounge.


The most famous entertainment venue in Evergreen City, and the highest-end bar and entertainment private club in the city.



Entry required a reservation.



Olivia's family had been in business for generations, with industries all over the country. Getting in here was a piece of cake for her.



The hall was bustling with activity. Olivia was wearing a black haute couture dress, just above the knee, with an open-back design. The top was adorned with ribbons shaped like gardenias.



Seductive yet pure.



Perhaps it was her aura that attracted people; many were gathered around Olivia, listening to her praise her private designer.



Olivia held a wine glass, her face already flushed, but she continued speaking, "I'm not lying to you. My friend is incredibly talented.She knows so much. The starry sky dress I wore when I debuted was designed by her, and the famous burgundy mermaid dress that everyone loved was also her creation. You don't come across such a genius every day."



Olivia hiccuped, "When she gets here, you all better treat her well.She was recently deceived and bullied by a bad man. Don't say I told you,okay?"



Olivia's fashion sense was famously good in the entertainment industry.



Those two dresses that were all the rage brought her a lot of attention. Many people had asked her where she, a newcomer,had borrowed such high-end dresses from and which famous désigner had created them.



Olivia proudly told reporters, "These were exclusively designed by my friend. There's only one in the world. Why would I need to borrow?"



It turned out to be true.


"My friend is here." Olivria spotted Isabella at the entrance.



Isabella's height was not short for a woman. Tonight,she wore a red long dress, with a cinched waistline that perfectly showcased her figure.



The off-shoulder design exposed her delicate skin under the flickering lights. As she walked, her slender legs peeked out from under the dress.



She exuded a noble and cool aura that made people hesitant to look directly at her. With such a perfect figure and appearance, even in the entertainment industry full of beauties, few could compare to Isabella.



Most importantly, Isabella no longer had to disguise herself.



Miss Wilson from the Wilson Family, Isabella, returned to the public eye.



Isabella walked straight towards Olivia, who was waving her hand.People around were captivated by her stunning face.



They had wanted to meet Olivia's private designer out of curiosity.



They didn't expect Isabella to be such a sexy beauty.



After not seeing each other for a long time, Olivia ran over and hugged Isabella. The two of them held hands and sat in the center.



Olivia introduced Isabella to the people around her. A group of seasoned socialites, seeing such a beauty as Isabella, naturally became very enthusiastic.



During this time, Olivia called over a few young men with good physiques and sweet tongues to drink and play cards with Isabella.



Isabella didn't refuse and played a round with them.



Little did she know, in a VIP room upstairs, Michael and Ethan were drinking.



Upon hearing that Michael was at The Velvet Lounge drinking,Bianca rushed over with her friends without a moment's delay.



Since last night, she was now widely recognized as Michael's unrequited first love.



She hadn't succeeded last night, and she couldn't miss this opportunity tonight.



Drunk men often lost control of their desires. As long as she appeared in front of him, everything would fall into place. So before coming here, she gritted her teeth and spent a fortune on a custom-made dress. The white tulle dress subtly revealed her figure,and she wore light makeup.



Both sexy and pure.



Men loved this kind of look the most. Tonight, she was determined to succeed.



"Bianca,wait a minute. Look over there. Isn't that your sister Isabella?"



Bianca followed the pointing finger and her face changed.



Why was she here?



"Look at the person next to her. Isn't that the popular star Olivia?How are they sitting together? Bianca, didn't you say Isabella was a lowly person who had been in the countryside for over a decade?"



Bianca forced a smile, "Maybe Isabella saw Olivia and went up to ask for a photo? You know she's just a bumpkin. It's normal for her to get excited when she sees a celebrity."
###Chapter 17 Isabella and Bianca Got into a Fight

"She really hasn't seen much of the world. She actually went over to drink with people just for a photo, completely disgracing the Brown Family."



"You forgot, Mr. Brown already disowned her. She's been kicked out."



"From now on, Bianca will be Mrs. Brown of the Brown Family.Haven't you seen how much Mr. Brown cares about her?"



Since last night, many people thought Michael and Isabella's divorce was all for Bianca.



It was only a matter of time before Bianca marries into the Brown Family.



Given the Brown Family's status in Evergreen City, many people suddenly started flattering Bianca. To curry favor with Bianca, a few of her friends deliberately walked in Isabella's direction.



Bianca stood aside, watching the show.



"Who do we have here, drinking with men? Oh, it's Mr. Browni's ex-wife who got kicked out?"



"What, Mr. Brown didn't want to have kids with you, so you're planning to find some random guy?"



Bianca's people deliberately provoked.



Isabella and her group, who were having a good time, stopped what they were doing upon hearing this.



No one would be happy having their mood ruined for no reason.



"The Velvet Lounge is really going downhill, letting in people with such poor taste. Aren't they afraid of lowering the place's standards?" Olivia glanced over coldly, not taking these people seriously at all.



"Olivia, I don't think you know who you're sitting with. Isabella used underhanded means to get the Brown Family's fortune. and now that her true colors have been revealed, she's been kicked out."



"She's a bad woman. You'd better stay away from her, orshe'll ruin your career."



The group spoke sarcastically.



"Seeing you guys is the worst luck of the day. Isabella, don't hold me back. I'm going to teach these people a lesson today." Olivia couldn't take it anymore and slapped one of them. "You should all sew your mouth shut and don't badmouth others. Do you even know who I am?"



Though Olivia was a movie star, she worked out a lot and had toned arms and abs.



With one slap from Olivia, one person fell directly onto the nearby sofa. "Someone help! The big stat Olivia is hitting people!" Those who hadn't been slapped started shouting.



"Hitting people? I'm not just going to hit people today; I'm going to enjoy it. Come on, hit them hard. I'll take responsibility for whatever happens!"



At Olivia's command, half of the people around her rushed over.



They knew Olivia's background well. As long as nothing major happened, they could gain a lot from a few hits.



They might even earn a favor.



The two groups fought fiercely, pulling hair and tearing clothes,creating a chaotic scene.



Taking advantage of the chaos, Isabella joined in.



After all, Olivia had started the fight for her, and she couldn't let her take the blame alone.
 Since it was inside a night club, many people came out to watch the commotion.



Although late-night fights were common, it was the frst time a brawl had broken out in a high-end club like The Velvet Lounge.



The Velvet Lounge had a powerful background, and ordinary people wouldn't dare cause trouble there.



Ethan had planned to get some information from Michael, but Michael wasn't falling for it, just drinking silently and ignoring him.



Bored, Ethan went out for some fresh air.



Hearing that the popular star Olivia was fighting with others in the hall, Ethan immediately went to watch the excitement.



In less than five minutes, Ethan returned to the private room with a strange expression.



He shook the nearly drunk Michael awake, "Stop drinking. Isabella
and Bianca are fighting!"



The information was too much for Michael. who frowned deeply.
"Ethan, what are you talking about?"



"I saw it with my own eyes. Isabella and your girlfriend Bianca are among those fighting downstairs. Come on, let's go!" Ethan was anxious and pulled Michael off the sofa.



At this moment, in the hall.



The club staff had already stopped the fight, and mnany of Bianca's side were injured.



Most of them were women, with scratches on their faces and necks.



Some even had their wigs pulled off.



As the victors, Isabella and Olivia had almost no marks on them.
But Bianca, who had planned to watch from the sidelines, was the most visibly injured.



Not only was Bianca's face swollen, but her sexy white dress was also stained with red wine.



Red and white patches made her look terrible.



"You crazy women, how dare you hit me? I'm calling the police and sending you all to jail." One of the girls, looking at the marks on her face,cried and took out her phone to retaliate against Isabella and Olivia.



"Go ahead, call them." Olivia raised an eyebrow, feeling great after venting her anger.



Bianca was also furious, but she was glad someone was standing up to Isabella for her. She had hoped to see Isabella humiliated in front of everyone.



Suddenly, a tall figure descended the stairs from the second floor,walking straight towards them with a cold expression. Bianca swallowed her words.



Michael had arrived.



Seeing Isabella bully her like this, he would surely avenge her.



As Michael approached, Bianca's eyes filled wíth tears,her body trembling slightly, waiting for Michael's rescue.



"Isabella, there's a limit to your nonsense!" Michael said coldly, and his imposing figure approached, exuding a strong sense of oppression.



Seeing Michael, everyone knew they couldn't afford to provoke him and retreated silently



No one in Evergreen City didn't know who Michael was.



Not only was he the heir to the Brown Family, but he had also established his own business empire, making him an unattainable figure.Seeing Michael personally intervene, Bianca's injured friends.
immediately felt emboldened, expecting Isabella to be scolded.



Before Isabella could speak. Bianca started crying. "Michael, thank goodness you're here, or Isabella would have killed me. I didn't say anything, but Isabella wouldn't let me go. Look at my body and face; it's all her doing."



Bianca cried even harder, trembling pitifully, desperately needing comfort.



If it weren't for her swollen face making people uncomfortable.



Michael glanced at Bíanca's face, his indifferent gaze quickly shifting to Isabella and the group of male models behind her.



He hadn't even agreed to the divorce yet, and she couldn't wait to find another man?



Seeing Isabella in that sexy red dress with her perfectly made-up face, Michael felt extremely irritated. As soon as she left him, she completely changed. eager to shor off her good figure to everyone.
###Chapter 18 He Protects Bianca


Michael felt a sudden surge of anger.



Michael's eyes were cold and deep. "Who gave you the guts to gather here and fight, injuring Bianca? What do you take the Brown Family's dignity for?"



Seeing that Michael was protecting her, Bianca cried and fell into Michael's arms.



Not only did Michael not refuse, but he also reached out and held Bianca.



He looked extremely distressed for Bianca.



Isabella's face was expressionless. She had already decided to divorce Michael, and she wouldn't be affected by whoever he was with.



She stepped forward, met his gaze, and spoke calmly,"You're
wrong. The Brown Family's dignity was lost the moment you abandoned Grandpa's birthday party for her. Do you not feel shameless blaming me now?"



Isabella's tone was light, her gaze meeting Michael's without any retreat.



Everyone knew that normally, no one at the company dared to look Michael in the eye.



Isabella wasn't afraid of him at all.



She even confronted him face to face.



Everyone around couldn't help but gasp.



Olivia was almost furious watching this. She reached out and tugged Isabella's hand.



Olivia knew how much Isabella liked Michael, but Michael had trampled on Isabella's dignity for Bianca, protecting that shameless
Bianca in front of Isabella.



Isabella must be feeling so hurt right now.



lsabella knew Olivia was feeling sorry for her and gave her a look.signaling her not to interfere.



This was between her and Michael. Others could help temporarily.but not forever. Everything depended on her.



Michael saw through her thoughts, a shadow passing over his eyes."Since you know her place in my heart, you shouldn't have hurt her."



"So,you want to hit me back for her?" Isabella looked at him quietly.



She wanted to see how far he would go to favor Bianca.



Michael smirked, his eyes downcast, not looking at her."Edon't hit women. Since you started it, I'll leave it to the police to handle."
Since she was determined to leave him and the Brown Famfly. he would let het taste what it was like to be unprotected.



After suffering, she would come back begging him.



Hearing about the police, the girl who had called them earlier stepped out. "Mr. Brown, leave this to me. I already called. My brother is the captain there. I'll make sure she goes in and doesn't come out."



The speaker was Layla Scott from the Scott Family.



The Scott Family needed the Brown Family in business, so she naturally wanted to impress Michael.



If she could help her family, it would be a great achievement.



Michael neither agreed nor refused.



Everyone assumed he had tacitly agreed. The next second. Michael suddenly bent down and picked up Bianca, walking towards the door.



Everyone was stunned, and some even whistled.



Bianca took the opportunity to cast a triumphant glance at Isabella.



Everyone knew what that meant.



When they looked at Isabella, their eyes were full of mockery.



Only Isabella herself didn't care about it at all. She turned to her friends and said, "The disgusting people are gone. We can continue having fun."



Everyone thought Isabella had really moved on, but only she knew how much it hurt to see Michael's distressed look when he picked up Bianca.



She had warned herself not to think about him anymore when she walked out of the Brown Family's door.But when he spoke up to send her to the police for Bianca.she couldn't help but feel heartbroken.



Olivia came over, her face full of concern and worry. "Isabella, are you really okay?"



How could Michael be so bad? Isabella was such a good wife, yet he ignored her and treated Bianca like a treasure.



Was Michael blind?



If she wasn't afraid of upsetting Isabella, she would have gone up and punched Michael.



Isabella shook her head and smiled indifferently. "L∘mfine. If he likes a woman like Bianca, it's his problem. Why should I waste my life on him? Didn't you find me so many male models? I haven't even finished picking!"


"You still have the mood to look for male models? I think you should think about how to avoid getting beaten up in jail. Mr.Brown just said he wouldn't let you go for hitting Bianca." With Michael as her backing. Layla now saw fsabella as an abandoned woman.



She could bully Isabella as much as she wanted.



As she finished speaking, the piercing sound of police sirens came from outside The Velvet Lounge.



Seeing this, Isabella laughed.



She stood there, not a trace of fear on her face, instead squinting at Layla, the woman who had called the police on her. "You're the first one who dare to arrest me,"



Layla sneered, "So what if I arrest you? I'll not only send you to jail but also make sure you suffer. Of all people, you had to mess with Bianca, Mr. Brown's favorite. Do you think a country bumpkin like you can touch her?"



In Evergreen City, Michael's word could make someone disappear.
Isabella was courting death by angering Michael.



"Fine, remember what you said now. I hope you can still say the same when we meet again."



As soon as Isabella finished speaking, two uniformed officers walked in quickly. "Who called the police?"



Layla hurried over, explained the situation, and then pointed at Isabella.



Isabella didn't explain anything. She walked over and said to the officers,′′Ihit her. Let's go. I'll cooperate."



"Isabella, don't make a fuss this late." Olivia gave her a look



She wasn't worried about Isabella but about the chaos that would ensue once these people found out Isabella'strue identity.



The whole police station would be in an uproar. Isabella was in a bad mood now, and she wanted to spend mor time with her.



But Isabella waved her hand, "It's fine. Let some people have their wish. I'll handle this. You stay and continue having fun. Don't waste the men you hired.I'll be back soon."



Seeing Isabella insist on going, Olivia felt even more sorry for her.



She understood why Isabella was so determined. Michael had embarrassed her in front of everyone and threatened her with the police.



Even though she could settle this with a word, Michael wanted to intervene.



So she had to go to the police station.



But now she was worried about Layla's intelligence.



Layla also heard their conversation and sneered, "Back soon? Do
you think the police station is your living room, where you can
come and go as you please?"



She had already informed her brother, Mason Scott. Once Isabella was in, she would make sure she suffered.



Isabella said nothing, got into the car, and went to the police station with the officers.



Layla, using her privilege, drove ahead.
###Chapter 19 Unless You Beg Him


When they arrived at the police station. Isabella was placed in solitary confinement.



Layla, with her freshly treated face, stood outside the door.chin held high in arrogance. "Scared now, aren't you? Weren't you just boasting that you'd be fine even if you got caught? WNhere's your bravado now? Show me what you've got!"



The person who hit her was Olivia.



But Olivia's status was untouchable, while Isabella was just a country girl kicked out by the Brown Family.



She could do whatever she wanted to Isabella.



Isabella sat straight, eyes closed, resting.



She hadn't had a moment's peace since morning and now felt utterly exhausted. Seeing Isabella completely ignore her. Tayla's face twisted fu mockery. "You're stilI pretending? Do you think Mr. Brown will come here for you? Dream on. He likes Bianca. He's probably comforting her at a hotel right now. But ff you kneel before me and slap yourself, maybe I'll put in a good word for you. How about it?"



Using her connections, Layla deliberately humiliated [sabella.



Isabella slowly opened her eyes at the words. She wore a black coat.exuding a natural aura of authority and laziness. "I don't need a reason to hit you. If you think I'll kneel before you, you're dreaming."



"You..." Layla couldn't stand Isabella's haughty demeanor,especially since she was just a country girl.



It made her very uncomfortable.



She took out her phone and started recording Isabella through the glass window, a cold smirk on her lips. ""You think you're safe because you haven't divorced Mr. Brown yet? If I post a video of you being detained online, do you think the Brown Family will still want you?"
Isabella shot her a cold glance. "Y advige you not to ask for trouble."



"Scared now?" Seeing Isabella's change in expression. Layla became even more smug. "You dare threaten me? Do you know where you are? This is my brother Mason's territory. You could be locked up for years!"



Layla paused, bringing the phone closer to Isabella. "And this video.I'll make sure everyone knows you're just a woman who got into Mr. Brown's bed through manipulation, only to be thrown out like trash. You were just a nanny for the Brown Family for a few years and you think you're Mrs. Brown? A country girl will always be a country girl."



"You better be ready to face the consequences." Isabella was truly angry now.



She was planning to divorce Michael.



But her status and public image were not something anyone could tarnish. Isabella's icy gaze made Layla shiver.



She quickly dismissed the thought, thinking it was impossible Isabella was just a country girl; how could she have such an authoritative presence?



Feeling embarrassed, Layla's face turned red.



She had someone open the door and asked Mason for two burly men to come in.



She couldn't retaliate against Olivia, but if Isabella wanted to take all the blame, she'd make sure she paid a thousandfold.



The two men pinned Isabella to the chair.



Layla glared and slapped her hard.



The sound echoed in the quiet room.
Isabella didn't resist, just smirked coldly.



She wanted to see how clueless Layla could be.



The sharp pain reminded Isabella of the fight at The Velvet Lounge earlier.



To help Olivia, she hadn't come out unscathed, but Michael hadn't even spared her a glance when he arrived.



He didn't ask if she was hurt but blamed her for tarnishing the Brown Family's and his dignity.



He turned and left with Bianca in his arms.


She had never held a place in his heart.



He only loved Bianca.



Meanwhile, at The Velvet Lounge, Olivia had dispersed the crowd
and paid to keup the incident quiet after Ysabella left.



Although Isabella had told her not to interfere, she couldn't just sit still.



Isabella was clearly agitated by Michael.



Otherwise,she wouldn't have gone with the police.



The emotions Isabella hid were not as indifferent as they appeared.



Michael was the man she had loved for years. Seeing him leave with Bianca in front of her, anyone would have been agitated.



Olivia thought for a moment and couldn't resist calling Michael.



After all, Isabella was still his legal wife, and he had sent her to the police station for Bianca. That was too much!



The call connected quickly, and Michael's deep, impatient voice came
through. "What is？＂



He clearly guessed it was Olivia.



Olivia's anger flared. "Isabella is in the police station because of you.and you don't care at all? You're a terrible man. Isabella is so unlucky to have married you."



"Olivia,watch your words." Michael's tone was calm, but his displeasure was evident.



"You abandoned Isabella for that shameless Bianca, and you expect me to speak nicely? I'm telling you, if you keep bullying Isabella,you'll face consequences soon. You'll regret it." Olivia was furious.



She should have stopped Isabella from marrying Michael in the first place.



"Really?" Michael's tone remained the same,but his voice grew colder. "Then why didn't you think of that when you took her to The Velvet Lounge to find male models?" Isabella had been much happier after leaving the Brown Fathlly:



Divorcing him made het so happy.



If she had just come to him like before and begged, he would have taken heraway.



But she refused.



Olivia felt Michael was so unreasonable. "How dare you mention male models? If you hadn't neglected her, Isabella wouldn't have gone out to find other men. Do you not understand how you've treated her these past three years?"



She took a deep breath. "Michael, I'll say it one last time. Isabella is at the police station. If you still consider her your wife, go get her Otherwise..."



"She's divorcing me. Do I need to save her?" Michael's chest felt tight, and his face reflected in the floor-to-ceiling window was dark.′′Iwon't help her unless she comes to me and begs." "You, Michael. are you out of your mind? You're the one at fault..."



The call was abruptly ended.



Olivia stared at her phone, fuming. She wasn't really worried about Isabella getting into trouble; Isabella could handle herself.



She just wanted to make things a bit easier for Isabella.



Michael was someone Isabella had cared about for over a decade.



How could she just forget him?



But she never expected Michael to be such a jerk.



Michael hung up and returned to the couch to continue drinking.



Even Ethan,sitting on the couch nearby, could feel the low pressure emanating from him. He had just been speaking coldly, bot now he seemed depressed.



Ethan sighed. "I really don't get you. What are you thinking? You indulge Bianca but won't divorce Isabella, and now you've sent lsabella to the police station?"
###Chapter 20 The Price of Provoking Me IsMore Than You Can Bear
Michael put down his wine glass, his eyes devoid of emotion. "I gave her a chance."



At the Brown Family, he had repeatedly tried to stop her, but she still Jeft.



Ethan sighed. He really didn't understand what was going on
between the two of them. All he knew was that Isabella being taken away was a big deal. "If you ask me, you should go check on her.After all, you two aren't divorced yet, and Isabella isn't someone who goes out much. If she gets scared in there, you'll be the one
who feels bad."



Michael said, "She went as far as paying a high price to have a child with another man. What would she be afraid of? If I don't teach her a lesson, she'll never know what she did wrong."



Ethan said,11But you didn't have to throw her into the police station just because you're mad at her, did you?"
"Why not? It's not like she can t speak for herself.



Ethan finally understood.



Michael was waiting for Isabella to apologize and admit she was wrong.



One phone call from Isabella, a few soft words, and everything would be fine.



But Isabella wasn't Bianca. After three years of marriage,she left the Brown Family without hesitation when she said she wanted a divorce.



A woman like Isabella would never back down.



"Michael, I'm saying this because you're my friend. If you don't want to lose Isabella, I suggest you go get her out of there as soon as possible. If something irreversible happens, it'll be too late for regrets."
As soon as Ethan finished speaking. Michael's phone rang.



It wasn't Isabella; it was his subordinate, Naron Eill.



Michael asked, "Did she admit she was wrong?"



Ethan replied. "No, Mrs. Brown didn't mention you. There's another force involved."



Meanwhile, on Isabella's side.



Layla's hand was red from hitting, but she still didn't feel satisfied.Just as she was about to kick Isabella, who remained expressionless,the door was suddenly kicked open.



Dozens of burly men rushed in, filling the room to the brim.



"Isabella!" The loudest voice came from Jesse Turner, who had been protecting Isabella since childhood. The simultaneous shout from cozens of men made Layit crettble ln fear.



Before she could react, her vision wene black, and a sharp pain shot through her wrist



When she opened her eyes again,Isabella was no longer in front of her.



When Layla found Mason, who could stand up for her,she saw the proud Mason bowing his head and apologizing to Isabella.



There were many people around, but Layla couldn't be bothered to look at each one.



She went straight to her brother, holding up her wrist. "Mason, why are you apologizing to her? Look at my hand; Isabella's people did this. Where is she? You should lock her up forever."



"And it was Mr. Brown who called the police. Even if she isn't really divorced from Mr. Brown, he won't want her anymore." The more Layla spoke, the louder her voice became. Everyone in the room.except Isabella. looked grim



"Layla, shut up!" Mason wwas sweating profusely. Isabella was not someone he could afford to offend.



Layla had been spoiled since childhood and had no idea what was about to happen.



Just as she was about to point at Isabella and speak again, Mason slapped her hard.



The force of Mason's slap sent Layla sprawling to the ground.



"Mason, you hit me for Isabella." Layla clutched her bleeding mouth, her face numb, looking incredulous.



Mason only wanted to save his own life. The police chief had personally come, and if he didn't say something, he would die a horrible death. "Ms. Taylor, Layla was ignorant and hurt you.I apologize on behalf of her and the Scott Family. This is a small token of my apology; please accept it. And I will make sure to discipline those two subordinates."He hadn't bean there earfer, so he didn'e know that Eayla had used his name to bring Isabella to the police station and even resorted to private punishment



Now. even his superiors were alarmed.



Not only could he not explain this to the Brown Family,but if they had really offended some powerful family,the Scott Family would be finished.



Looking at the bank card in front of her, Isabella's expression remained indifferent. She didn't take it."Keep this money for Layla's plastic surgery."



After all, Mason's slap had disfigured Layla's nose.



Mason swallowed hard, understanding that Isabella had no intention of forgiving Layla easily.



He felt a growing sense of fear. 1f Isabella really wanted to take down the Scot Pamfly. It wouldn'c even take half a day fot them to disappear from Evergreen City.



"Isabella. you bitch! You must have slept with some old man to get this privilege. How dare you say that? I'll kill you!" Having been slapped hard by Mason and publicly humiliated by Esabella and her men. Layla had lost all reason.



She picked up a nearby vase and aimed it at Isabella's face.



If her face was ruined, Isabella wouldn't have it easy either.



But Layla underestimated the men around Isabella. These men were handpicked from elite soldiers.



There was no way they would let Isabella get hurt again.



Without anyone else moving, Ethan, the leader, swept his long leg sending Layla flying into the wall like trash.



The vase shattered on the ground, and Layla clutched her face and
hand.screaming like a ghost.



Mason's Face had turned as white as a sheet.



He could already foresee the Scott Family's fate.



Isabella slowly stood up and walked over to Layla.



With her high heels, tall stature, and the imposing presence of dozens of men behind her, just a slight raise of her eyebrow exerted immense pressure.



She lowered her eyes, her voice icy.′′Didn't I tell you that you couldn't afford the price of provoking me?"



"You..," Layla tried to curse, but a rag was stuffed into her mouth.



Isabella looked at her with cold eyes.′′Did you really think I wouldn't hold a grudge? Don't worry, your punishment is coming." With that. Isabella raised her hand slightly and her m1e11immediately understood.



Two of them dragged Layla into the confinement room.



The rest surrounded Mason.



Isabella had been hit, and anyone who had laid a hand on her wouldn't get away.



At the hospital.



Isabella sat in the emergency room, with three doctors attending to her wounds.



In the past, even a minor injury to Isabella would alarm the entire hospital.



Especially given today's situation, Isabella's face was swollen. If it weren't for her reluctance to reveal her identity,the Scott Family would have been wiped out. Anyone with some status knew the Wiison Famfly's posltfon.



Whenever the Wilson Family took action, fe struck fear Into people's hearts.



No one had ever dared to bully Isabella.



Ethan stayed with Isabella in the room, while dozens of burly men in black suits stood outside.



No one dared to approach.



Someone came in to ask what to do about Layla and Mason next.



Ethan's face was cold. "The Scott Family dared to lay a hand on Ms. Taylor. They can forget about staying in Evergreen City.Send them all to Auroria to mine!" (I highly recommend a captivating book that I couldn't put down for three days and nights. It's incredibly engaging and a must-read.The title of the book is "Revenge of the Entertainment Queen" You can find it by searching for it in the search bar.)
###Chapter 21 Who Is That Man?


At the Scott Family's house.



Layla, who had been detained and reprimanded by Isabella's people,returned home and just finished recounting the incident.



Layla's father, Vance Scott's face changed and made a phone call.



He immediately convened a family meeting overnight.



Two hours later, the study door opened, and several influentia1 and powerful familie members, along with Layla's grandfather,Will Scott, came out with dark expressions.



Layla sensed something was wrong.



Isabella might not be an ordinary person at all.



Her backing was something even the Scott Family couldn't afford to provoke.



But she still held a glimmer of hope. În. Evergreen City, could anyone be more powerful than Michael?



Isabella must have slept with some old man who didn't dare reveal his name to gain such privileges.



If Michael knew about this, things could be different!



Layla didn't believe Michael could tolerate Isabella being ambiguous with other men. "Dad, why are you afraid of that country bumpkin?Mr. Brown allowed the police report. She bullied someone Mr.Brown likes."



Everyone in the room turned cold, and Vance stepped forward and kicked her. "Layla, it's one thing to mess around, but did you leave your brain at home? How could you provoke someone like Isabella?You almost got Mason killed."



Others chimed in,′′Itwas hard enough to get Mason into the police department through connections, and now you've bumped into someone we can't afford to offend. Not only did you implicate Mason, but you also dragged the entire Scott Family into this. What were you thinking?"



"Did you even consider that just because Michael told you to call the police, you actually dared to do it? No matter how much they argue,they're still a couple. Don't you know that every wealthy family cares about their reputation? Do you even know who you can't afford to mess with?"



Layla was dumbfounded by the scolding.



How could this be?



Michael had taken Bianca away at the time. How could he still care about Isabella,his ex-wife?



Vance ignored her and turned to discuss countermeasures with Will.



Will shook his head after listening. Lay]a panicked.



She didn't have time to go to the hospital to check her injuries and hurriedly called Bianca.



"Bíanca, only you can save me now!" Layla told Bianca everything that happened at the police station, asking her to plead with Michael.



After all, she had taken Isabella away to vent Bianca's anger.



Now that she was in trouble, Bianca couldn't just ignore it.



Bianca was already angry that Michael had left her on the street last night. Now, learning that Isabella had been released from the police station after only a few hours, she was even more upset.



Who exactly was Isabella seducing to be able to leave the police station unscathed?



Layla,the Scott Family's young lady, was so scared that she had to ask Michael for protection.


But there was a silver lining.


This time, Isabella was definitely entangled with another man.


If Michael found out, he would definitely go to City Hall to divorce her.



Thinking of this, she dialed Michael's number and exaggeratedly told him what she had just heard from Layla.



It was already early morning.


Michael had someone find out which hospital Isabella was in,hung up the phone, and went straight to the garage.


He didn't stop for a moment.


He wanted to see which man she was with this time. At this moment, his subordinate Aaron called with an important report. "Mr. Brown, among the people Mrs. Brown has interacted with in the past year, there are no suspicious individuals. However,there is indeed an issue with someone named Thomas."



"Go on!" Michael opened the car door and questioned coldly.


"We couldn't find any information on Thomas's identity wvith our intelligence, including Mrs. Brown's. It's as if someone deliberately erased their records. But we found a photo through other clues,confirming that Mrs. Brown and Thomas have known each other for a long time."



A photo quickly came through on his phone.


In it, Thomas had his arm around a teenage Isabella under a tree,both smiling brightly at the camera.



Sitting in the car, Michael's eyes turned red with anger at the sight of that smile.



"Mr. Browvn, should we continue investigating Thomas? If our intelligence can't find anything on him, it's highly likely that he is..."


"I don't care who he is. Make him disappear from Evergreen City completely,along with his team of lawyers." Michael said.



"Yes!"



"Wait!" Michael suddenly spoke, instructing over the phone, "Help the Scott Family and find out who is helping Isabella."



"Understood."



Hospital.



Isabella lay in the VIP ward, unable tosleep, so she sat up and looked at her phone.



She actually saw something interesting



Bianca had posted a Facebook update. The photo was of her in a hotel, fresh out of the bath, with a half-exposed shoulder, a flushed face, and ambiguous bite marks down her neck.



The caption read: [The one you love will return to you no matter how long the separation.]



Anyone with a keen eye could tell what had just happened.



Especially since Michael had left with Bianca earlier in the night.



They had gone straight to the hotel and had sex all night.



Isabella wished she could reach through the screen and slap both of them.



She cursed that Michael would last no more than two minutes during sex in the future and that he would have erectile dysfunction every time.



Michael arrived at the hospital and found Isabella's ward, where Ethan and a group of black-clad bodyguards stood outside.


But seeing that it was him, even Ethan hesitated.


He had seen the photo and knew Michael's place in Isabella's heart.so he didn't dare to really stop him.



Michael walked straight in without looking sideways.



Seeing Isabella sitting on the hospital bed with a medicinal patch.playing with her phone, Michael's expression grew colder."To get you out of the police station and have someone guard you1,is that man Thomas?"



Michael had come in a hurry, wearing only a black shirt and suit pants. Standing there, he exuded a chilling aura.


With a bang, the door was shut tightly behind him.


Isabella was momentarily stunned. She had just seen Bianca's post on her phone, and the next second.Michael appeared.



She couldn't help but glance at his lower body.


Could her curse have worked?



Could he really have erectile dysfunction?



No wonder all her attempts to seduce him over the past three years had failed. The problem was with him, and having a child with him was out of the question.



Shaking her head, Isabella calmly looked at Michael, "What does it matter who are outside? This is my ward. Please leave!"



Hearing this, Michael's jaw instantly tightened. He strode forward and pulled off her blanket, "Fine, then come with me."



Without waiting for Isabella to react, he hoisted her onto his shoulder. "Michael, what are you doing? Put me down!" Isabella shouted.


"You'll find out soon enough." Michael said coldly.



Isabella didn't expect Michael to actually take her away.



She was both anxious and angry.



Especially since he had just had sex with Bianca in a hotel and now came to bother her?



Hanging upside down on Michael's shoulder, Isabella was so angry that she bit his neck.



Michael winced in pain.


Was Isabella trying to bite him to death?



She used all her strength, He couldn't help but slap her on her perky butt. With a crisp sound,Isabella's face turned red, and she let go.



Isabella called out. "Michael, you pervert! Try hitting me again!"
###Chapter 22 Just Throw It Away


Isabella kept wriggling, and Michael directly ordered, "Stop moving!"



"Why should I listen to you? Put me down!" Isabella was both embarrassed and angry.



"Not a chance!" Micheal directly refused.



"Michael, you..."



"Move again, and I'll carry you to Daniel right now and let him see you like this."



After that video call, Michael knew that Daniel was Isabella's weakness.



Sure enough, at the mention of Daniel, Isabella immediately quieted down. In her current state, not even Thomas should know about it.



She quieted down, but her gaze was sharp enough to kill Michael.



Michael slid Isabella down a bit, holding her in his arms. Isabella didn't dare to resist and let him carry her into the car.



Ethan and the others could only watch, unable to do anything.



After all, Michael was Isabella's husband.



Michael took Isabella back to the Brown Villa.



The room, which had been a mess in the afternoon, was now cleaned up.



Michael placed her on the bed and immediately started taking off his clothes.



"What are you doing?" Isabella thought  about how he had just been with Bianca and pushed him away in a panic. "Get away from me!Don't touch me with the hands that touched someone else. It's disgusting."



Michael staggered, and the anger he had just suppressed flared up again. He unbuttoned his collar.



He directly pinned Isabella to the bed, his unique cold scent enveloping her. "You think I'm dirty? Weren't you dirty when you were with that Thomas? I want to see how clean you are!"



"Michael,you bastard. Let go of me." With her hands pinned above her head, Isabella could only wriggle her body to try to escape him.



Isabella's restless movements beneath him only served to arouse him more, and the desire in Michael's eyes was clear.



Isabela's strength was no match for him; he only wanted to make love to her now.



Michael easily tore open Isabella's loose hospital gown,revealing her delicate and beautiful body. Michael's breathing grew heavier.



It was as if he would turn into a wolf and devour her completely.



"Michael, you're crazy. You just want to take revenge on me for Bianca, right? Hit me if you want, but don't touch me!" Isabella:shouted from beneath him, and the swelling patch on her face was rubbed off.



Her face was red and swollen.



The desire in Michael's eyes was instantly replaced by anger. He stared at her face, his voice hoarse,'"Who hit you?"



Isabella didn't want his sympathy and turned her face away,"Does it matter if I tell you? Get off me!"



She had once longed for his attention, waiting at home every night until late, but he never came back to accompany her.



Now he was even more excessive. He had just made love to Bianca in a hotel earlier that night, and now he was here to take revenge on her for Bianca.



Did she really mean nothing to him?



Isabella refused to turn her head, not seeing the angry look in Michael's eyes when he saw the injury on her face.



Someone dared to hurt Isabella? They must be courting death!



Suddenly,her phone rang.



The caller ID showed it was Bianca.



Michael didn't move, and Isabella picked up the call.



"Isabella, why are you doing this? It's one thing to hit me, but Layla is innocent. Why did you have to harm her family? You're so cruel!"



Hearing Bianca's pretentious voice, Isabella felt nauseous,"Don't worry, there's more to come. You might be next."



Bianca laughed, having another trick up her sleeve, "Isabella, you probably don't know yet, but Michael has already decided to help the Scott Family. And you must have seen the photos I just sent.Michael is really amazing. He left in such a hurry that he forgot his coat here."



Isabella looked up at Michael, who was only wearing a shirt, and sneered, "He's right next to me. He said clothes that touched dirty things should be thrown away like trash."



With that, Isabella hung up the phone.



Her feelings were complicated.



She had thought he was taking revenge on her for Bianca.



But he cared about Bianca even more than she had imagined,even coming to her to avenge Layla's grievances. "Mr. Brown, you really are devoted. Is there anyone you wouldn't help if they asked?" Isabella's tone was sarcastic.



For the sake of Bianca, he had really let go of his years of stubbornness.



Michael's eyes darkened, and he tightened his grip on her wrist, "I never expected Thomas to destroy the Scott Family for you. What exactly is your relationship with him that makes him take such risks for you?"



Isabella sneered, "So, you're only worried about your male pride.Have you ever thought about what I've been through? Even when I was publicly humiliated and almost killed, you still stood by Bianca's side. Michael, you are the least qualified person to question me."



Michael wanted to ask her what had happened.



Isabella kicked him off the bed with all her strength. "Get out, I don't want to see you anymore. From today on, you can continue being a good man and have your romance with Bianca, but let me tell you, the Scott Family won't get away with this!" She would avenge herself.



Even if Michael got involved, she would make Layla pay.



"Isabella!" Michael called out.



Couldn't she just talk to him nicely like before? Even if she softened a bit, he wouldn't go against her.



"Don't call my name, it's disgusting." Isabella said.



Michael's face darkened, his whole body exuding a cold aura,"Fine,you said it."



He stood by the bed, glanced at the gray sky outside the window,and then looked back at Isabella on the bed. "You want to end things with me, but what about Daniel?"



"What does my grandpa have to do with you?" Isabella turned away, not looking at him, her voice muffled. Michael took a deep breath, "You haven't forgotten what was said in the video, have you? Grandpa said that your grandpa has already come to Evergreen City Hospital to recuperate after receiving your call. I told him that we would visit him together at ten tomorrow morning."



"I don't need you. I won't let you see my grandpa!" Isabella sat up in anger, her chest heaving violently.



Michael sure knew how to pissprovoke her off. "It's not up to you.We're still married, whether you like it or not. Besides, visiting your grandpa is something I should do. What right do you have to stop me?"



"You!" Isabella was almost blinded by anger,′′Ican't control what you do, but don't think you can threaten me."



She got out of bed, found her old clothes from the wardrobe,and stormed out, slamming the door behind her.



She didn't want to see Michael for another second. In the room, Michael didn't chase after her.



He knew that in a few hours, Isabella would definitely appear in front of Daniel.



But there was something he needed to know now. He called Aaron,"Come to the Brown Villa. I'm going to the Scott Family myself."
###Chapter 23 Are You Begging Me?
 The next day.   Isabella put on some makeup and went to the hospital alone.    Daniel had worked too hard when he was young, leaving him with many old injuries. Now that he was older, he had serious heart problems.    He couldn't handle too much stress, and sudden emotional outbursts.were out of the question.    This was also why she didn't dare to let Daniel know about the divorce.    But what Isabella didn't expect was that Michael showed up.    He even arrived earlier than she did.      In the hospital room, Daniel lay on the bed. Perhaps because he had just undergone some tests, he looked much worse than he did in the video call last night.   But he was a respected businessman in his younger days, and even in old age, he still exuded a powerful aura.   Years of experience had only made him more convincing.   It was Michael's first time visiting Daniel, and he brought many valuable medicinal gift boxes.    Although it was their first meeting, they didn't seem unfamiliar with each other.    They were chatting and laughing when Daniel looked up and saw Isabella standing outside.    His eyes lit up, "Isabella. Let me see if you've gained any weight. What's wrong with your face? Why is it so red?" Isabella walked closer, and Daniel immediately noticed something was wrong with her face.    His expression changed, "Who bullied you? Tell me!"   "Grandpa, it's my fault. I bought Isabella a bouquet yesterday,not knowing she was allergic to that kind of pollen." Michael cleverly helped her out.    But Isabella didn't want to see himn here.    Not even for a second.    But considering Daniel, she gritted her teeth and explained,"Grandpa, it's just a minor allergy. It's nothing.You know who l am; how could I let anyone bully me?"    Isabella tilted her face to show Daniel. She had used ice to reduce most of the swelling before coming.   Now it just looked red, very much like an allergy Daniel frowned with concern, "You must not have taken good care of yourself. How could you have such a severe allergy?"   "It's all my fault. I didn't take good care of Isabella." Michael spoke sincerely,slightly lowering his head as if he were genuinely remorseful.    Isabella couldn't help but roll her eyes secretly.    Michael was such a good actor; no wonder she had been deceived by him all these years without realizing it.   "Alright, alright." Daniel nodded at him, "I don't blame you. You two are still young and have a long way to go. I'm old now, and the family matters will depend on you."   "The doctor said that as long as you rest, you'll recover in two or three months. How can you say you're old? I was thinking of asking you for some chess tips. Grandpa said you were the best back in the day." With just a few words,Michael changed the subject.   Daniel loved playing chess.  Being praised by Michael, his spirits lifted.    He had been worried that Isabella might suffer after marrying Michael, especially since she had forced the marriage with the engagement.    But now it seemed Michael did care about Isabella    Michael not only came to visit him personally but also knew he liked chess.    He was a thoughtful person.    Sitting by the bed, Isabella glanced at Michael, feeling speechless.    When did Michael learn to play chess?    He was so good at pleasing people; who knew what schemes he had in mind.  "Just pleasing më isn't enough. Your grandpa and I really want to see you have a child soon. Only then can we be at ease." Daniel spoke bluntly.    Michael pressed his lips together and nodded at Daniel, "Yoư're right. Isabella and I should have our own child."    Isabella was stunned.    She thought, 'Is Michael addicted to acting? Having a child? How?Nobody would have a child when getting a divorce!'    Seeing the two of them start discussing children, Isabella quickly spoke up,"Daniel, I've already contacted Dr. Gray and sent him your medical records. Once he responds, your illness will be cured.    Michael looked at her, "Are you talking about Dr. Gray, the founder of the Pioneer Medical Research Institute, Sean Gray?"    "You know him?" Isabella was surprised.     
Sean was a top expert in heart treatment.   But he was always elusive and had a unique personality. The consultation fee Isabella offered was enough to support their research institute for a year, yet Sean still hadn't responded.   To show her sincerity, she planned to visit him personally in the coming days. If necessary, she would agree to any conditions Sean proposed.   As long as he could cure Daniel.   Michael raised an eyebrow, "Not exactly. The Brown Group collaborates with Sean's wife's medical company."    Daniel knew Sean's temperament.   He smiled, "Don't worry about me. Sean is eccentric. No need to find him. I know my own body well. If you two have a child, my illness will be cured immediately." Isabella knew Dániel didn't want to trouble her.    But she was raised by Daniel; how could she watch him suffer without doing anything? "Grandpa, you said it yourself. Taking care of a child is exhausting. You need to get better first to help me take care of the child."    "Alright, alright, I got it." Daniel soon felt tired.    Isabella anad Michael said their goodbyes and left the room.    Outside, Isabella thought about what Michael had said and stopped him, "You can contact Sean, right? Only he can save Daniel."    Thomas had tried to invite him before, but Sean was. so eccentric that he ignored people he didn't want to see.    But she couldn't wait any longer.    Daniel's condition was worsening; otherwise, he wouldn't look so bad after just a check-up.  Anyone would develop some feelings in three years    Especially since she was his wife.    Michael couldn't just stand by and do nothing.    He looked down at Isabella blocking his way, a slow smile forming on his lips: He stepped closer, cornering her.    He lifted her chin, his voice low, "Are you begging me?"    Isabella was forced to look up at him. They were so close that she could smell his scent.    The scene of their argument last night flashed through her mind.    She turned her head,"Ican give you money. How much do you want?"    Michael sneered, tightening his grip on her chin, forcing her to look  at him, "Do you think I need money? Or do you forget that every card you have is from me? Using my money to ask me for a favor.do you think I'm a fool?"    Isabella paused, realizing Michael didn't know she had money.    Biting her lip, she said, "Forget it. I'll find another way."    She raised her hand to push him away    But Michael grabbed her waist, pulling her even closer.    Like this story? Leave a review and encourage the author! 
###Chapter 24 Taking Over the Wilson Group
Michael and Isabella looked so close it seemed like they were about to kiss.



Michael stared at her flushed face, his voice hoarse,′′Don't blame me for not telling you, no one but me can get Sean to do anything."



"What do you want?" Isabella stared at him.



"Beg me!"



"Michael, you really are shameless." Isabella felt helpless.



Even at this point, he still wanted to humiliate her.



Isabella raised her hand to push Michael away, but he firmly grabbed her wrist, lifting it above her head,



It was just like their actions last night Unable to move her hand, Isabella lifted her leg.


Michael seemed to see through her, his tall figure pressing down,easily pinning Isabella in his arms.



They were even closer now.


Isabella couldn't ignore the change in Michael's body.


Someone could walk by the hallway at any moment, and Isabella's face was flushed with anger. "Michael, this is a hospital. If you want to have sex, go find Bianca. Don't touch me."


MichaeI's expression remained indifferent as he warned her, "If you don't want Daniel to know we're not getting along, you can speak a little louder."



Isabella bit her lips tightly.


He was doing it on purpose. But that didn't mean she would just give in, "Michael, if it's not money, then what do you want?"


"If you were my wife, you will only have to ask. But if you insist on distancing yourself from me. I have no reason to help an outsider."Michael's words were clear.



If Isabella insisted on divorcing him, he wouldn't help her even if he could.



She suddenly laughed.


He was Michael, the most distinguished and powerful man in Evergreen City.



He could easily crush someone's hope.


But he clearly didn't love her, so why couldn't he just let her go?



"Michael, I don't understand. We've been married for three years,and you've never looked at me properly. Now that I've finally decided to let you go, you disagree. Do you find it fulfilling to toy with other people's feelings?" Isabella felt bitter.



He didn't want her, yet he wouldn't let her go.



How long did he plan to torment her?



The hurt in Isabella's eyes stung Michael's heart.



He didn't understand why her sadness made him feel so uncomfortable.



But one thing was clear.



He didn't plan to let her go.



"Why should I agree?" Michael's face darkened, "Isabella, do you think I'm some toy you can discard at will?"



He suddenly let go of her, stepping back, exuding a cold aura."The
position of Mrs. Brown was something you begged for with the marriage contract. Now, it's not up to you to end it."



Isabella understood.



Michael didn't have feelings for her; he was just unwilling to accept it.



She had been the one in control of this marriage from the start.



It hurt his pride.



Especially since he already had someone in his heart. She had taken Bianca's place, and it was a wonder he didn't hate her more.



She had naively thought he would help her for the sake of their three years of marriage.



Michael gave a direct order,′′I2'm giving you one last chance. Do you want to come back to me?"With that, he turned and left.


Isabella stood there, the cold wall keeping her clear-headed.



But the grievance of being bullied by Michael mnade her eyes wet.


She didn't want anyone to see her vulnerable side, so she bit her lip tightly, not letting the tears fall.



She was the daughter of the Wilson Family;she had never shed tears easily.



The word "surrender" was never in her life motto.



Just then, Thomas called. "Isabella, the lawyer is ready. Are you sure?"



He was referring to Isabella and Michael's divorce.


"Yes!" Isabella took a deep breath, "Thomas, I've made up my mind.
I want to divorce him."


After ending the call. Isabella walked outside and made another call.


Soon, Ethan appeared by her side, standing behind her,"Ms.Taylor!"



Isabella instructed him, "Send our people out to find Sean. If he won't accept a high price, then bring him here by force,but don't hurt him."



Time was running out. Since Michael wouldn't help her, she had to find a way herself.



No matter what it took, she had to bring Sean here.


Daniel's illness couldn't wait any longer.


"Yes, I'll get right on it." Ethan's eyes lit up. He had a feeling that the decisive Isabella from years ago was coming back. But Isabella didn't expect Daniel to suddenly fall into a coma.



That night, Daniel's most trusted subordinate, Chris Diaz,called Isabella.



He asked her to return to the Wilson Group to take charge, to prevent any upheaval within the company due to this incident.



"What about my uncles?" Isabella didn't expect things to change so suddenly.



Chris sighed, "You know, they have no interest in Mr. Daniel
Wilson's business. Now they're all abroad and can't come back. The only one left is Mr. Thomas Wilson, but..."



Isabella knew Thomas's temperament.



His ambitions lay elsewhere.



Chris also felt it was difficult for Isabella, but there was no other way now."Ms. Taylor, you are Mr. Daniel Wilson's chosen successor.
Now that Mr. Daniel Wilson is setiously ill, the Wilsoh Group is in your hands."



Back then, Isabella had voluntarily married into the Brown Family for the Wilson Family, helping them in their toughest tímes.



At that time, Daniel had already planned to hand over his business to her.



But Isabella had stepped back for Michael, and Daniel had hoped she would have a child, so the matter was never brought up again.



Now...



Isabella didn't hesitate. The Wilson Family's matters were her responsibility, "Chris, I'll be there tomorrow."



"By the way, Ms. Taylor, there's something you need to know." Chris said, "The Wilson Group has been expanding from the East to the South in recent years. But due to Mr. Wilson's worsening condition and your three-year absence, the Wilson Group's stock has been highly volatile. Recently, the Brown Group has been making moves,
trying to seize our resources and planning a takeover."



At the mention of the Brown Group. Isabella felt like her lungs were about to explode with anger.



That scoundrel Michael dared to touch the Wilson Family's business!



After hanging up, Isabella called Ethan, "Have you found Seam?"



Ethan reported, "Ms. Taylor, Michael's people took Sean before we could."



Michael again!



Isabella was furious. She would see what Michael was up to.



The next day.



Isabella went straight to the Brown Group building. Slamming the door of her flery red sports car, she took off her sunglasses and walked in, high heels clicking.



She wanted to confront Michael face-to-Tace and ask ifhewas determined to go against her.



"Where's Michael?" Isabella went straight to the reception desk.



The receptionist glanced at her and then continued with her work as if nothing had happened.



She even secretly mocked, "It's funny how some people think that just because they're rich and good-looking, they can have something with Mr. Brown. Do they even know who Mr. Brown is?"
###Chapter 25 How Dare You Stop Mrs. Brown


"T'm Michael's wife. Where is he?" Isabella was pressed for time and didn't want to waste it on irrelevant people.


"Wife?" The receptionist burst into laughter. "Ma'am, you might want to get your facts straight about Mr. Brown's personal life before coming here. Mr. Brown's wife just went upstairs with breakfast.Who exactly are you?"



"Breakfast?" Isabella let out a cold laugh.



She didn't need to think to know who it was.



Michael had begged her not to divorce him yesterday,and today he was entangled with Bianca at the office.



She wanted to see just how shameless he could be.


Ignoring the shouts behind her, Isabella walked straight into the CEO's private elevator. The receptionist called security to chase after her, but Aaron,the assistant, arrived just in time.



He quickly stopped the security guards and coldly reprimanded the two receptionists, "Are you out of your minds? How dare you stop Mrs. Brown?"



Hearing Aaron's words, the two receptionists turned pale with fear.



They were done for.



They had mistaken Bianca, who had gone upstairs with breakfast,for Michael's wife, not realizing that Isabella was the real Mrs.Brown.



Their earlier remarks had likely cost them their jobs.



Aaron hurried to catch up with Isabella, not forgetting to send a message to Michael.



He informed him that Isabella was here. She would be at his office in five minutes.



As Michael's assistant and subordinate, this was all he could do.



Michael received the message promptly, glanced at it, and his expression remained unchanged.



Only the slight curve of his lips indicated his good mood.



It seemed his words from yesterday had worked.



Isabella still couldn't bear to let him go.



"Michael, I made these desserts this morning. Try them and see if you like them." Seeing that Michael's mood had improved, Bianca seized the opportunity and walked over to him with a piece of dessert.



She had deliberately chosen a form-fitting dress that accentuated her figure. A slight bend was enough to showcase her alluring curves.



Michael was focused on his phone and didn't respond, so Bianca boldly sat on his lap.



Isabella pushed the door open just in time to see this. "If you're in such a hurry, why not get a room at the hotel next door? Or do you find it more thrilling to have an audience?" She stood there, coldly mocking.



Michael looked over, reaching for the dessert in her hand."正fyou want to watch, I don't mind."



Bianca was thrilled and tried to get closer to Michael, but he moved forward, leaving her perched on the armrest.



However,the fact that he ate what she made said it all.



Looking at the defeated Isabella, Bianca said smugly, "Isabella, what are you doing here? I heard Daniel wvas brought from the countryside for treatment. If you keep opposing Michael, you might not even get the medical bills." Bianca's eyes were full of pride.



Isabella might be Mrs. Brown, but Michael's heart belonged to her.



Whoever had Michael's heart was the ultimate winner.



Isabella ignored Bianca. She was here for serious business with Michael.



Otherwise, she would have taken a picture of the scene just now and used it as evidence in court.



She strode to the desk in her high heels, exuding confidence, and threw her limited-edition handbag onto the table.



She coldly looked at Bianca.′′Do you have any right to speak here?Your mother wasn't satisfied being a mistress, so you took over for her?"



"Isabella, you..." Bianca wanted to retort but didn't dare reveal her true nature in front of Michael. "What do you mean, 'you'? You're so cheap, clinging to someone else's husband like a free toy, and you feel proudf of it." Isabella said.



Bianca's eyes reddened with anger, but all she could say was,
"Isabella, this is Michael's office. At least act with some decorum and not like a shrew, okay?"



Michael hated people who spoke crudely.



So for years, she had always been elegant and gentle in front of him making Isabella's rustic manners even more apparent.



Isabella laughed. "If I'm a shrew, then what are you? A slut who seduces other women's husbands?"



Bianca's palms were almost bleeding from her nails digging in,and she was seething with hatred.



She was the daughter of the Taylor Family, groomed with millions of dollars from a young age, the most famous piano prodigy in Evergreen City, and Michael's ex-girlfriend. How could she stoop to arguing with a country bumpkin like Isabella?



It was utterly disgraceful.



She stood up and looked pitifully at Michael. "Michael, it's all my fault. I shouldn't have come at this time."



She hoped Michael would back her up.



But Michael didn't even lift his eyes.



Bianca bit her lip and glanced at the handbag Isabella had placed on the table. Not only wvas it a limited edition, but it was also the last work of a famous designer, worth millions of dollars.



Looking at her own bag, which was only worth a few hundred thousand dollars, Bianca didn't feel envious because she knew Isabella couldn't afford such a bag.



There was only one in Evergreen City, bought by a wealthy tycoon.
Bianca disdainfully looked away, convinced Isabella's bag was a fake.



She turned to Michael. "Michael, I have a piano recital in a few days. I'll go prepare for it."



Michael, sitting in his chair, only looked at Isabella. When he heard Bianca was leaving, he nodded slightly.



As Bianca walked past Isabella, she said, "Isabella, I know you like these designer bags, but you should live within your means. Try not to carry fake ones around."



With that, Bianca walked out.



She didn't give Isabella a chance to respond.



Isabella was speechless. How dare Bianca question the authenticity of her bag?



But she couldn't be bothered to explain to Bianca. She had carried a canvas bag for three years of marriage and never felt anything about it.


It was just a bag.



"Now, let's talk abouIt our business." Isabella pulled out a chair and sat directly across from Michael.



Her coat was open, revealing a sexy black silk tight skirt underneath, adding to Isabella's cold and alluring aura.


Michael felt that Isabella surprised him every time they met.


He suddenly remembered something, and a meaningful smile appeared on his lips. "In three years of marriage, this is the first time you've come to see me."


Isabella frowned, not understanding why Michael was bringing this up.


She wasn't here to discuss that. "Hand over Sean, and you can name
 your terms!"



Michael placed his hands on the table, his eyes deep as the ocean.
"Haven't I made my. terms clear?"
###Chapter 26 It's So Much Fun Toying with You

Isabella gritted her teeth, "Divorce is out of the question,but you can ask for anything else."



Michael knew she wouldn't compromise so easily, but the fact that she came to see him in person was a step forward.



He squinted his eyes, "Fine."



"Say it," Isabella's heart filled with hope.



She thought Michael had a bit of kindness in him, but his next words made her want to walk out immediately.



He said, "Then let's have a child. Since both Aiden and Daniel wish for us to have our own child, as long as you get pregnant,Daniel's illness can still be treated."



Isabella's eyes widened, and she slammed her hands on the table,
"Michael, are you out of your mind!"



She had already decided on the divorce, how could she have a child with him?



In three years of marriage, she had tried everything. but he just ignored her.



Now he wanted to have a child with her, where was he before?



"You don't want to?" Michael's face was expressionless as he said,"Then there's nothing more to discuss."


Seeing his extremely cold demeanor, Isabella's head throbbed with anger.


Just then, Michael received a call about how to take over the Wilson Group's branch in the South.Michael's tone was determined.
 Isabella's hands clenched tightly at her sides.



She wouldn't just stand by and watch Michael go after the Wilson Group. Not only that, but she also wanted him to pay for what he was doing now.



Knowing that continuing the conversation was pointless, Isabella turned and left.



Watching Isabella storm out, Michael hung up the phone, a complex emotion fashing in his eyes.



That night.



Michael stayed at the office.



The entire building was dark except for the top floor.



Even Isabella had to acknowledge Michael's capability at work. He had taken over the Brown Group at a young age and achieved in a few years what others couldn't in decades. No wonder Aiden chose him as the heir among all the grandchildren.



"You're really dedicated, still working so late?" Isabella pushed the door open, casually taking off her coat to reveal her sexy figure wrapped in a tight camisole.



Fiery red lips, smooth skin.



She walked towards him step by step in the night, like a seductive siren.



Michael thought he had strong self-control, but when his eyes fell on Isabella, he was stunned and couldn't look away.



Why hadn't he noticed this side of her before?



He put down what he was holding, his tall body leaning back slowly, his eyes seeming to see through her,′′Dressed like this, are you agreeing to my terms?" Michael's alluring voice was low and husky.



Isabella didn't respond directly, her red lips curved as she walked to the desk and pressed her hand on the documents in Michael's hand.



Her eyes lifted slightly, "I thought you had a hard day and needed someone to keep you company at night. Why don't we continue our conversation?"



She lowered her voice, her eyes filled with silent temptation.



When it came to understanding Michael, she was far better than Bianca.



He liked women like Bianca, so she would act the part for him.



"Alright, I don't mind spending the night talking with you." Michael raised an eyebrow, getting up to open the door to the rest area behind him.



It was where he usually took his lunch breaks, fully equipped. Especially the large bed, which looked about 6 feet wide.


He glanced at her, signaling her to join him in the room.



Since she had gone this far, he was happy to play along and see if she really dared to go in with him.



Isabella clenched her fists, keeping her composure, and walked over calmly.



The moment the door closed, her heart raced, and she nervously swallowed.



But Michael didn't give her a chance to back out, holding her and pressing her onto the large bed.



Michael, with the familiar scent she knew, trapped her beneath him,unable to move.



Isabella suppressed her nervousness. She reached out her delicate arm to wrap around Michael's neck,her eyes lively and captivating, taking the initiative. "What's the rush?"



Michael's strong arms propped up beside her, only then noticing a special scent on her.



He just took a shallow sniff, and found it nice



Had she changed her perfume?



But Isabella didn't give him time to think, one hand around his neck, the other sliding down his collar.



Her smooth fingertips teased Michael's body.



Michael's breathing grew heavier.



As she moved, Isabella's camisole strap slipped off. Her chest was half-exposed, even more eye-catching.



She didn't care, her eyes burning as she looked up at Michael,
"Michael, your muscles are so hard, they're hurting my hand."



"Isabella, it's your choice. Don't regret it later." Michael's voice was deep and hoarse, his eyes staring at her like an abySs.



Isabella chuckled, deliberately going against him, "Michael, are you even a man? If I say I regret it, will you let mne go?"



"No!" As soon as he finished speaking, Michael lowered his head and kissed her hard.



From the moment Isabella walked in, he had no intention of letting her go.



He kissed her lips, his large hand caressing her slender waist.



Isabella's initiative and beauty made him tense all over.He wanted to strip her and possess her.



After three years of holding back, he didn't want to wait any longer.



The sound of a phone camera brought Michael back to reality.



Seeing Isabella taking pictures with her phone, he frowned slightly,panting as he asked, "Why are you taking pictures? Do you want to keep them for yourself?"



When Michael leaned in again, Isabella dodged his kiss, pushing him away and getting up.



Her earlier passion and tenderness were gone, replaced by sharpness in her eyes, "You're right, these are rare, of course, I want to keep them for myself."



She adjusted her clothes while sending the intimate photos she just took to Bianca's phone,



Since he cared so much about Bianca's feelings, let her taste what it felt like when she received photos of them.



Michael just stood there watching her do all this.



Then he grabbed her phone, pinning Isabella down on the bed, his body pressing over hers, his fingers gripping her chin,′′Isthis fun for you?"



Desire dissipated, Michael's body now covered in a cold chill.



No one had ever dared to toy with him like this.



Isabella was the first.



But she wasn't afraid of him, instead, she sneered at him,"正t7SSO much fun toying with you,"



Michael's face darkened, his grip tightening, his eyes cold enough to freeze.
 Isabella endured the discomfort, letting out three years of pent-up grievances and resentment at this moment."Michael, I'm telling you.I am definitely getting this divorce. I will leave you,have the child.but you will never be the father."
###Chapter 27 Critical Condition Notice


"Really?" Michael stared down at her, his voice cold and devoid of any emotion. "Don't forget, Daniel's life is still waiting for you to save."



"I'll find a way to help my grandfather. You should worry more about yourself right now." Isabella pushed his hand away and escaped while he was distracted.



Michael reached out to pull Isabella back, but suddenly his body became unbearably hot.



Isabella smirked, knowing he couldn't do anything at the moment."Forgot to tell you, I applied an aphrodisiac on myself. The effects have already kicked in, Don't worry, your first love, Bianca, will be here soon. You two should stay together forever,"



With that, she picked up her phone and walked out in front of him.



She wanted Michael to understand how determined she was to dívorce hím. He thought he could use Daniel's ilness to force her to compromise and submit to him. Itwas daydreaming.



Before the marriage, she wanted him badly.



But now, she wouldn't want him even if he was willing.



As Isabella opened the door, Michael's voice, filled with extreme suppression, came from behind, "Isabella, have you thought about the consequences of leaving like this today?"



Without looking back, she turned the handle."If you can hold on until tomorrow, we can talk. I'm always ready."



The door slammed shut, and Michael stood by the bed, looking like a demon from hell.



His mind kept replaying her words, gritted throügh her teeth, that she would divorce him and have children with another man.



What did she take him for? A rag to be thrown away? He panted heavily, took out his phone, and called Aaron. "From now on, no one is allowed to enter the company building."



After speaking, he threw down the phone and went into the bathroom.



Letting the cold water pour over him from head to toe.



Isabella was right. The moment Bianca saw the photos,she couldn't control herself and rushed to the office building.



That place, that bed, with Isabella and Michael on it.



She wasn't stupid. Once they made love, it was too late for anything.



But she didn't expect to be denied entry when she got downstairs.



Bianca desperately explained her identity, but it was useless. She called Michael, but no one answered. She called Isabella, but her phone was off.



She was about to lose her mind, screaming and shouting at the elevator entrance.



For three whole years, Michael hadn't touched Isabella once. She thought if she endured a little longer, she would have a chance once they divorced.



She never expected Isabella to seduce Michael at the company.



In the photos, Michael's eyes were filled with desire, looking at Isabella as if he wanted to devour her.



Michael was clearly someone with strong desires.



With both of themn naked on the bed, how could nothing have happened?


 
She couldn't stand that. It should have been her lying next to Michael. It was Isabella who prevented her from marrying into the Brown Family and being with the man she loved.



Isabella took the place that should have been hers



She would never let Isabella off.



On the top floor, Michael came out after nearly half an hour of a cold shower.



He had always had strong self-control, but when he smelled the lingering scent of Isabella in the air, he was aroused uncontrollably again.



His mind kept flashing with images of Isabella's soft body and red lips.



And those harsh words she had said.



He took a deep breath, picked up his phone, and decisively went to
the outer office.


At that moment, a call came to his phone.


It was Sean, whom Isabella had been looking for in vain.


"Mr. Brown, it's me. I received the medical records you sent." Sean's tone was very polite.



He was nothing like the eccentric person the rumors described.



Michael didn't tell Daniel everything.



He did have a collaboration with Sean's wife, but the premise of this collaboration was that he had saved Sean's wife's life by chance.



Sean had also promised him that he would help with anything he needed.



Michael's voice was still hoarse. "How is it? Can Daniel's illness be cured?"



Sean replied, "Mr. Wilson's illness is indeed a bit trícky, but it's not a problem for me. I'm confident I can save him."



"Then I'll leave it to you." Michael said.



"By the way, Mr. Brown, someone has been inquiring about my whereabouts recently. They didn't reveal their identity, but I can sense that they are very powerful, possibly on par with you."



Michael frowned at this. "I'll arrange for you to enter the country first and stay somewhere untraceable. Before that, I need you to personally examine Mr. Wilson."



"No problem, I was thinking the same," Sean said.



Additionally, Michael instructed him not to contact anyone for the time being and to wait for his message.



He guessed that the force looking for Sean was likely Isabella. To have connections worldwide meant that neither she nor Daniel could be ordinary people.



He then called Aaron again. "Check all the information about Daniel."



Isabella received a call from her uncle, Holden Wilson,from abroad as soon as she got home.



He said their people had found Sean's address, and he would personally go to invite Sean to treat Daniel in the next couple of days.



Isabella finally felt a weight lifted off her shoulders.



Without Holden, she wouldn't have dared to confront Michael so recklessly last night.



"Ms. Taylor, about your divorce appeal with Mr. Brown..." Seeing Isabella's happy smile, Jesse cautiously reminded her. He hnad just learned that Isabella had called him out after three years to divorce Michael!



Now that things were about to go to court, he was really worried it would reach Daniel.



"There's no rush. We'll talk about it after my grandfather's condition stabilizes." Isabella understood Michael's character. He didn't want to give money now, and even if it went to court, he had ways to delay the case.



Rather than wasting time with him, she wanted to see Daniel's condition stabilize before bringing it up again.



But things often take unexpected turns.



Shortly after hanging up, Isabella received a call from one of
Daniel's subordinates.



Daniel's condition had worsened, and the hospital had issued a critical condition notice. Isabella was so scared her legs went weak.



She hurried to the hospital and watched as Daniel was wheeled into the ICU, his eyes closed and face pale. Isabella couldn't hold back her tears.



In this world, Daniel was her closest and dearest family.



Without Daniel, she would have been tormented to death by Harper and Bianca in the Taylor Family.



Now she had to watch Daniel suffer from illness.



How could she not feel heartbroken?



Quickly wiping away her tears, Isabella called Holden,only to hear more bad news.



Sean had left the country overnight, and no one knew where he had gone. Isabella immediately thought of Michael



It was him.



Only he could take Sean away under the watchful eyes of so many people.



She couldn't wait any longer.



If Daniel died because she took revenge on Michael, she would never forgive herself.
###Chapter 28 Signing the Agreement


Isabella floored the gas pedal, heading straight for Míchael's villa.



For the past three years, whenever he wasn't back at the Brown Family, he was at this place.



The house was not far from the Brown Group. She had asked Aaron about his schedule and knew he was home.



The door wasn't locked.



She pushed the door open and went straight in, only to see Michael coming out of the bathroom completely naked.



He had probably just finished showering. Michael was drying his hair with a towel, his long legs stepping out, his perfect body fully exposed in front of her.



Water droplets slid down his muscular abs, trickling over his honey-colored skin, rolling over his abs,and disappearing into his groin. Isabella almost stopped breathing.



Her face turned bright red.



But even so. she didn't run away; she stood quietly in place.



Arms crossed, she carefully examined Michael in front of her.



His muscles were well-proportioned, with clear lines and textures.Further down, his genitals, wrapped in black underwear, were so large they seemed about to burst through the thin fabric.



In three years of marriage, this was the first time she had seen him completely.



Her mind couldn't help but recall the thrilling scene from last night.



If she hadn't stopped that kiss in time, she was really afraid Michael would have had sex with her. Knowing she couldn't let her thoughts run wild, Isabella closed her eyes and gritted her teeth. "Michael, do you have some kind of exhibitionist fetish? Can you put on some clothes before coming out?"


Michael had seen her early on. He sneered and calmly wrapped the towel around his waist, covering himself. "You sure know how to wrong me. Do you even realize whose lands you're on?"


As he spoke, he took a step forward, trapping Isabella against the wall. His large hand caressed her cheek, his voice low. "You rushed over here so eagerly. Do you want to continue what we didn't finish last night?"


Isabella's face tightened.


She almost forgot that Michael loved to hold grudges. The way she treated him last night, he would probably pay her back tenfold today.


But even so, she had no choice.Knowing what was about to happen. Isabella swallowed hard and still said, "H I say continue, will you keep your promise?"



After speaking, she tightly closed her eyes, knowing that even if they continued, Michael wouldn't let it go just like that.


Sure enough,after hearing her, Michael let out a cold laugh from his throat.



He stepped back, put on a bathrobe, and sat in front of her, leisurely lighting a cigarette in her presence.



The white smoke obscured his exquisite features and hid the raging anger in his eyes. "Toying wwith me is fun, isn't it? You want to do it again?"



"Michael, I didn't..." Isabella tried to explain.



"Get out!" Michael interrupted her.


Isabella bit her lip, suddenly thinking of something. Michael liked Bianca so much; they must have made love in that room last night.



She was too reckless, provoking him and now having to beg him.



Isabella couldn't leave.



She came in front of him, barely meeting Michael's eyes as he sat."Last night was my fault."



He sat in front of her, hearing her apology, a slight surprise in his eyes.



Then he returned to his cold demeanor, sneering, "You think one apology will make me forgive you?"



Isabella knew she couldn't turn hostile. Daniel was still waiting for her to save.



She had to endure. But she also knew that Sean must be in his hands right now. He deliberately hid Sean so she couldIn't find him.



He was pretending to be innocent.



In the end, he just wanted to see her beg.



IIsabella truly wanted to give in.



"I was really wrong, Michael. Please forgive me this time." Isabella lowered her head, her voice hoarse.



At that moment, Michael suddenly leaned in, staring at her red lips,getting closer and closer.



Seeing he was about to kiss her, Isabella had no choice but to compromise.



Before she could feel the soft touch, suddenly, her waist tightened as something pinched her hard, "It hurts." Isabella widened her eyesat him, covering her lower back and instinctively stepping back



Michael probably liked to play some other tricks



Michael gave her a cold look and ordered, "Come here and dry my hair."



"Is that all?" Isabella asked in disbelief.



Michael curled his lips, a mocking laugh escaping. "You wish. I'm just testing your sincerity. We'll talk about it later."



Isabella angrily gripped the towel in her hand.



She thought, 'So, he found it fun to tease me? Just wait. Once Daniel's illness is cured, I'll see how to get back to him.



She stood beside him, pressing the entire towel on his head. With a bit of force, Michael became displeased."Dry it properly. Don't forget why you're here." Isabella didn't dare disobey, her fingers gently pressing on his head.



Neither of them spoke, the air filled only with their shallow breaths.



From her angle, Michael had his eyes closed, his long eyelashes subtly reacting to her movements.



Sunlight poured in from outside, adding a touch of warmth to the scene.



"Alright, it's done." Isabella didn't like the warm atmosphere between them. If they could get along so harmoniously, why was it now?



Just as she was about to dodge, her wrist was grabbed by a strong force.



In an instant, she was pressed onto the bed, Michael hovering above her, his breath hot as he looked at her. "Aren't you here to make peace? Why are you dodging?" Michael's bathrobe was wide open, revealing the texture of his skin inside.



Isabella was momentarily at a lossfor words but forced herself to stay calm. "Didn't you have something to say to me? Let me go first."



He raised an eyebrow, getting even closer, his voice ambiguous.′′Wcan do it in bed."



Isabella blushed instantly.



Michael was already aroused.



Isabella thought, 'Didn't he just have sex with Bianca yesterday?



"You want me to hand over Sean, but you have to sign an agreement first." Even though his body had reactions for her,Michael's voice remained calm when he spoke



"What agreement?" Isabella sat up, her expression becoming tense. Michael took a document from the drawer and handed it to her.



Isabella opened it and saw four clear terms written on it.



1. No private interactions with any other men



2. No more talk of divorce.



3. Starting tomorrow, she would move in and live with him.



4. The child must be his; she couldn't have someone else's.



Looking at the four terms listed, Isabella couldn't help but twitch her mouth.



Michael must have known she would come and prepared this for her in advance, right?



She bit her lip, staying silent. Michael's voice suddenly turned cold."If you don't agree, you can leave now!" Isabella said, "The first two terms are fine, but what do the third and fourth mean? I move in with you, and then what? For how long? Andthe child. I'm not considering that for now."
###Chapter 29 So Eager?


"You'll stay as long as I say." Michael raised an eyebrow, clearly not planning to let her off the hook. "As for the child, isn't that what you wanted most from me?"



"Isabella, my patience is limited." Michael's calm demeanor belied the cold-blooded words he spoke.



Isabella knew that if she didn't sign, Daniel's condition wouldn't hold until she found Sean.



In front of Michael, she had no choice.



′′F1ne." If signing could save Daniel, she was willing to be used as a bargaining chip.



Isabella quickly signed her name and then looked at Michael urgently,′′My grandfather received a critical condition notice at the hospital. Where is Sean now?" Michael glanced at his watch, "He's already at the hospital."



"You..." Isabella realized she had been played.



He had planned everything, just waiting for her to fall into the trap



Bastard! How could she have trusted him?



Michael acted as if he didn't notice her change in expression. He put away the agreement, stood up, and looked down at her, "Go take a shower."



The oppressive look in his eyes was just like last night when she had drugged him at the company.



Isabella shivered involuntarily.



The agreement was already signed.



Nowv, whatever Michael did to her was justified. As long as Daniel was okay, she didn't care!



She would just consider it as sleeping with a top male model. It wouldn't have to be.a loss for her.



Isabella went into the bathroom and slammed the door shut.



But she didn't know that the bathroom door was semi-transparent.and her graceful figure was faintly visible to Michael inside the room.



Michael's throat tightened.



He had only intended to provoke her, but now he was the one suffering.



Her scent still lingered at his nose, and Michael felt restless. He had to light a cigarette to suppress his desire.



Inside the bathroom. Isabella deliberately slowed down. Just then, her phone rang.



It was Daniel's subordinate, Chris.



Isabella quickly grabbed a towel and answered the call.



She was afraid something had happened to Daniel.



Fortunately, the news was good. Chris said, "Ms. Taylor, Mr.Wilson's surgery was successful. The doctor said he's not in immediate danger."



"Really? My grandfather is finally out of danger." Isabella sighed in relief.



Chris continued, "Ms. Taylor, Mr. Daniel Wilson is still unconscious.
The Wilson Group is unstable and needs someone to take charge.Also, the Brown Group is pressing hard. The Group is in a difficult situation."



Isabella instinctively glanced outside while holding the phone. She whispered to Chris, "Chris, inform everyone that I will attend the shareholders' meeting tomorrow on tíme. Also, put the southern expansion on hold. We'll discuss everything after my grandfather recovers."



At times like this, she needed to stay calm.



With Daniel absent, she had to guard everything at the Wilson Group.



As long as she was there, she wouldn't let anyone take it away.



Once Daniel's condition stabilized, she wouldn't let Michael get away.



Chris said,"Understood. One more thing, Mr. Holden Wilson's search for Sean has been discovered by Mr. Brown's people.He might already be suspicious of you. If he finds out about Mr. Daniel Wilson, your identity will be exposed. Since Mr, Brown will find out sooner or later, why not tell him yourself? That way, Mr. Brown won't target the Wilson Group anymore." Tell Michael?



That thought had never crossed her mind.



This agreement was temporary. Once Daniel recovered.she would still divorce him.



That wouldn't change.



If she took over the Wilson Group,she and Michael would be business rivals in the future, possibly competing for projects.



"Chris, I'll handle this. Don't worry about him. Remember to pick me up early tomorrow." Ending the call, Isabella felt much better.



The heavy burden on her heart was finally lifted.



She knew Sean's capabilities. With him, there would be a way to cure Daniel. Feeling relaxed, she took a comfortable shower and even started singing.



Michael, sitting on the bed, heard the singing and thought he was hearing things. She wasn't like this when she signed the agreement Was it because of Daniel?



Just finding Sean made her content.



It seemed he owed her too much in the past



Shaking his head, he stubbed out his cigarette and left the room.



When Isabella came out of the bathroom, she realized she had no change of clothes, and the only set she had was wet,



She decided to pick a white shirt from. Michael's wardrobe.



Michael, being nearly 6 feet tall, had shirts that Isabella could wear as a dress, just long enough to cover her butt, eliminating the need for pants. Buttoning up, she casually tossed her long hair, revealing her slender neck and collarbone.



The collar was too wide for her, exposing half of her shoulder to the air.



Her skin was delícate and alluring.



"I'm so good-looking with a great figure. Everybody Ioves me.Michael must be blind." Isabella couldn't help but sigh im front of the mirror.



After that, she shook her head, thinking of Michael who could appear at any moment, and wrapped herself in a bathrobe.



Michael was about to enter when he heard her words, and couldn't help but twitch his mouth.



The next second, Michael walked in and saw Isabella wrapped tightly in a bathrobe, only her long legs exposed
 His eyes darkened.



Isabella cleared her throat."I'm done. If you don't need anything,I'll go to another room."



After last night's ordeal, she was extremely sleep-deprived.



But she knew the agreement only allowed her to stay here, not necessarily in his room.



Just as she was about to leave, Michael stopped her. "Stay."



"What is it?" she asked.



"Playing dumb won't work with me. Come here!" Michael's eyes narrowed, not buying her act. He patted his thigh, "Sit here. You know what to do, don't you?"



Isabella gritted her teeth, knowing Michael was getting back at her for last night. But she had no choice.



It was frustrating.



She walked over slowly.



Avoiding eye contact, she sat on his lap, took a deep breath, and pushed Michael from the bed's edge onto the bed.



Her hands pressed against his chest.



Michael's eyes darkened, his suppressed desire ignited by her actions.



He gripped her waist and smirked, "You're so eager?"



"Take it easy, there's more to come." Isabella straddled his lean waist, her bathrobe slipping halfway off, the shirt underneath barely covering the essentials. But it couldn't hide her alluring curves.
###Chapter 30 A Qualified Wife


Her nimble little hand roamed over his well-defined chest muscles.teasingly asking him, "Did Bianca serve you like this last night too?"



Both of them were wearing bathrobes, and the moment their skin touched,it was like an electric shock, causing Michael's breath to quicken.



The room was filled with an ambiguous atmosphere.



Michael grabbed her mischievous hand, his voice hoarse, "She was much more skilled than you."



"Oh, really?" Isabella sneered, her face indifferent.



Michael couldn't stand her nonchalant tone. He leaned over and pressed Isabella beneath him.



His whole body was burning with desire, and he wished he could merge her into his body right then. His passionate and domineering kiss took her breath away. Just as Isabella was about to break through the final barrier. she wrapped her arms around his neck and whispered softly in his ear. "Michael.I'm on my period."



"Michael. I'm on my period."



She thought, 'Go find Bianca if she's better.'



It was like a bucket of cold water was poured over him, and Michael's desire was instantly suppressed.



Michael's face was dark and stormy at that moment.



His chest heaved violently, angered by her.



He stared at her coldly for a few seconds, then lowered his head and bit her neck hard, his voice low and hoarse, "You better really be on your period."



With that, he quickly got up and moved away from her."Or what, are you going to check?" Isabella blinked and asked.



Michael's face turned even darker.



Isabella took out her phone, "Already angry? Didn't you say Bianca was more skilled? Since she serves you better and is the one you like, why not call her over to help you, how about that? Of course,you don't have to worry about my presence. Although we have an agreement, I won't be jealous like before. You can completely pretend I don't exist."



Isabella really intended to hand him over to Bianca.


If it were before, she wouldn't have been able to bear it.



Michael didn't go far, still standing by the bed. His bathrobe was deliberately pulled open, revealing his sexy and strong body.



But his gaze towards Isabella was icy cold


He sneered,"You really are a qualified wife, pushing me towards
Bianca."



He had seen her do such things with his own eyes, which made Michael feel extremely irritated.



He couldn't hold on for even a second.



He grabbed his clothes and slammed the door as he left.



In the large master bedroom, only Isabella was left.



When she heard the sound of the car outside, she finally put away her smug expression and lay weakly on the bed as if all her strength had been drained.



She had no other choice.



But why did her heart hurt so much when she saw Michael leave angrily? Isabella buried her face in the pillow, breathing in Michael's masculine scent.



Fresh and clean.



She tried not to think about where Michael drove off to and who he went to find, then forced herself to focus on what would happen
tomorrow.







Before marrying Michael, she was the envy of everyone as the young lady of the Wilson Family. Daniel treated her like a treasure,and her five uncles pampered her like a precious gem.



None of her uncles were interested in business, so she was naturally seen as the sole heir to the Wilson Family's empire.



She used to be bright and proud, with a touch of Daniel's style in her words and actions, passionate and domineering. In the past three years, her name had suddenly disappeared from the eastern part of Valoria.



Some people secretly gossiped that she was too greedy, not only wanting to take over the Wilson Family but also trying to seize the ownership of her five uncles.



That was why she was stripped of her heir status and exiled.



Some even boldly speculated that she had been assassimated.



Her disappearance was just to cover up the traces.



But no one really knew that in the past three years, she had married Michael.



Michael, who had never had feelings for her in those three years.



Three years later, the Wilson Family faced another crisis. Daniel was in a coma in the hospital, and her uncles were all abroad, each with their own businesses and influence, well-established for many years.
The only one in the country, Thomas, had no interest in inheriting the family business.



He even saw it as a burden.



Many shareholders in the Wilson Group wanted to take that position.



Isabella couldn't help but think of what Daniel had told her.



The Wilson Group's foundation was built by him and a few brothers who had gone through life and death together. Even if it was to be handed over to the next generation, it had to be someone capable enough to command respect.



Only by earning everyone's respect could they go far.



In Daniel's heart, he hoped she could be the sole heir, believing in her ability.



Only she could protect the Wilson Family's empire. But he also didn't want her to bear too much pressure too early.



It was because of his strict education with Grace that a little bit of tenderness from Indigo had won Grace over.



In Daniel's heart, he hoped Isabella could live happily according to her own wishes.



Not forced to take on the family's responsibilities because of her uncles' reluctance.



So over the years, even though his health was poor, he had always held on to manage the Wilson Group as its president.



Looking at the only photo of Daniel and Grace when they were young on her phone, Isabella felt complicated.



In the photo, Grace was wearing a dress, looking very young. Grace was holding Daniel's arm like a child, sitting on a swing in the garden. Daniel didn't look as old as he did now. His eyes were sharp.
mature, and charming, looking like he was in his forties.



But now, Daniel was lying in bed,unconscious.


His body and energy were no longer what they used to be.



Daniel had only one daughter, Grace, in his life, and he loved her dearly.



She couldn't imagine how heartbroken and pained Daniel must have been to find Grace after searching for so long, only to lose her.



At that time, she could only watch as Harper and Bianca entered the Taylor Family, driving Grace to her death, with Indigo coldly watching from the side.



She would never and could never forget that scene.



She wouldn't let any member of the Taylor Famnily off. She knew Daniel didn't want to take action against the Taylor Family back then because he didn't want her to harbor hatred, but now she had grown up and could handle things on her own.



Looking at the photo of Daniel, Isabella softly said, "Grandpa, I couldn't protect Mom before, but this time, I won't let you leave me.Let me protect you and the Wilson Family."



After a long day, Isabella fell asleep on Michael's bed, holding her phone.



When she woke up the next dlay, she almost missed the time to go to the company.



Fortunately, Chris called and had prepared a suit and speech for her.



Isabella washed her face and sent her location. to Chris.



Meanwhile, inside the Wilson Group. The large conference room was noisy.



Hearing that the Wilson Family's heir, who had been missing for three years, was returning to take charge, everyone was shocked.
###Chapter 31 Establishing Authority


Daniel only had one daughter, Grace.


Isabella disappeared for three years, and even many high-level executives and board members within the company had never seen this rumored heir ofthe Wilson Family.



People speculated that, despite being Daniel's granddaughter,Isabella had no real authority.



She was just a figurehead.



Otherwise, how could Isabella have no news for three years and suddenly appear now?



Some even guessed that this Isabella might not be Daniel's granddaughter at all, but rather a woman Daniel found outside to pose as his granddaughter.



Daniel thought it would sound bad if the truth got out, so he
deliberately fabricated this false identity.


No one knew what the two of them were doing behind the scenes.


The men present laughed a couple of times, exchanging glances.


After all, Daniel made his name and fortune through gambling.



Decades ago, the borders of Valoria were not as strictly managed as they were now, and local powers could practically rule their own territories.



They had absolute control.



Daniel, young and ambitious at the time, was recruited by a local overlord because of his impressive skills and became part of his family.



Later, Daniel successfully took over the local power.
In the following decade. Daniel foresaw the changing landscape and transitioned early, founding the Wilson Group with his close associates.



Daniel grew the company into a powerhouse, becomingthe undisputed overlord of eastern Valoria with his strong capabilities and exceptional foresight.



In eastern Valoria, the Wilson Family was enough to instill fear.



Most of the board members in the group were friends who had fought alongside Daniel. They had mostly not received formal education and were used to a life without oversight from a young arge.



After years of good times, they had changed.



They relied on their long tenure in the company to act arrogantly.often hiring people unrelated to the work for the sake of personal connections.



Over time, this led to various conflicts within the Wilson Group.
After the earlier speculations, no one took Isabella seriously.



Some even said, "A woman who only knows how to serve men,how dare she take over the entire Wilson Group."



Before the words even settled, there was a loud thud.



A man wvas kicked into the wall and then rolled to the ground.



The entire conference room fell silent.



Everyone's eyes turned to Isabella, who had suddenly entered the room.



Isabella was dressed in a white suit, with a matching pencil skirt that accentuated her graceful curves and slender legs.



Her curly hair cascaded over her shoulders, and her exquisite eye makeup and bold red lips exuded a domineering aura similar to Daniel's.
Everyone realized her identity.



They didn't dare to make a sound because they saw the man standing behind Isabella.



It was Chris, Daniel's trusted subordinate for many years.



Many of Daniel's orders were issued through him.



Chris's presence was enough to represent Daniel's intentions.



Isabella coldly glanced at the man on the ground who couldn't get up, "Chris, this man is no longer needed in the company. Make him disappear from the Wilson Group."



"Yes, Ms. Taylor."



"You dare to fire me?" Barry Myers struggled to stand up.leaning against the wall. He recognized who she was and, thinking about the kick just now, his face turned pale with anger.
Barry had always been arrogant in the company, and no one had ever dared to speak to him like that.



Even Daniel would give him some face for old times' sake.


"Open your eyes and see clearly. When I was facing danger with Mr.Wilson, you didn't even know where you were." Barry said.



Isabella sneered. Before she came, Chris had already given her the personnel list.



She walked up to Barry, looking down at him with cold eyes, her high heels clicking on the floor. "If it weren't for your relationship with my grandfather, you would be lying in a hospital right now.Either I shut your mouth, or I shut you down!"



Isabella's voice was calm,but the inherent threat in her words sent chills down everyone's spine.



After all, they knew very well who was backing her, given that she could bring Chris along.
Barry on the ground clearly didn't expect Isabella to be so tough.He leaned against the wall with one hand and held his waist with the other, trembling as he walked out, not forgetting to leave a parting shot, "Don't get too cocky. I won't let you off."



Isabella didn't even bother to look at him.


Before getting married, she had been through a lot.


No one in the Wilson Family was raised to be easily intimidated.



Then she calmly walked to the main seat, and Chris efficiently pulled out the chair for her.



Isabella sat down confidently, her hands folded on the table, wearing the family crest ring that symbolized the highest status in the Wilson Family on her index finger.



The dazzling sapphire reflected light into everyone's eyes.


Everyone gasped.
That was Daniel's ring.


It was also the symbol of the next heir to the Wilson Group.


Daniel hadn't even considered his own sons, and now he had truly given the heir position to Isabella?



Isabella looked like she was just in her early twenties.



But the dominance and coldness in her eyes made everyone below not dare to speak.



If they really opposed her, they didn't have much substantial power in their hands. If their shares were stripped away, they would have nothing left.



Isabella glanced around.


She tapped the table lightly and said coldly, "I've already
familiarized myself with your identities. You should have guessed who I am. Let me formally introduce myself. My name is Isabella,
and I am the granddaughter of Chairman Daniel. From today onwards, I will be the president of the Wilson Group."



Then Isabella's gaze swept around the room, her calm demeanor carrying a sharp edge, every move reminiscent of Daniel. "If you have any questions, you can ask them now. I don't like scheming behind my back."



From beginning to end, Chris stood respectfully behind Isabella.



He only leaned in to listen when Isabella gave him instructions.



Now everyone believed that Isabella was indeed Daniel's granddaughter.



She didn't even blink when she kicked Barry out, and Chris didn't even ask for a reason, just followed orders.



It was clear that Daniel had made up his mind.


Isabella was the future head of the Wilson Group.
With this identity, who would dare to oppose Isabella? It would be courting death.



Seeing no one speak, Isabella glanced at the time and signaled to Chris.



The meeting officially began.



Chris,who was very familiar with the company's internal affairs,quickly directed everyone's attention to the crisis of the Wilson Group's expansion into southern Valoria.
###Chapter 32 Building Momentum


The Brown Group and the Wilson Group originally intended to collaborate to acquire ownership of a small offshore island, aiming to create a unique landmark facility in Evergreen City that combined entertainment and leisure.



As soon as the proposal was issued, nearly half of the Brown Group voted in favor.



But now,with Daniel seriously ill and hospitalized, coupled with the unfamiliar territory of southern Valoria, the stock market has been sluggish.



The Brown Group now needed a strong partner to stabilize the situation, and the offshore island project had become the best stepping stone.



Others couldn't see it, but Isabella could spot the problem at a glance.


Michael's scheme was too obvious.
"You all see it too. The Brown Group is waiting for us to invest in this island, but if we really do that, all of the company's funds will be tied up. Then, the Brown Group will target our other assets, and we'll be left with an undeveloped island. You all should know what the outcome for the Wilson Group would be then."



Isabella analyzed the pros and cons one by one.


Her words were not harsh, but each one hit the mark.



The Wilson Group's stock had been sluggish due to its expansion into southern Valoria. If nothing was done, the group's funds would shrink.



Everyone present was a shareholder receiving dividends; who could tolerate losing money like this?



In hindsight, they shouldn't have come to southern Valoria.



They were thriving in eastern Valoria, but everything changed when they came to the south.
"So what do you suggest? If we don't cooperate, are we just going to watch the group's funds drain away?"



Everyone present was shrewd. Since Isabella had taken the position of president, she naturally had to bear this responsibility.



Isabella glanced around and decisively said, "First, I completely reject the offshore project. Second, we can take over other projects in the stock market, such as investing in education and healthcare in the northern remote areas of southern Valoria, while conducting extensive publicity and collaborating with local charitable organizations."



"We need cooperation to save the group's reputation. Doing charity means spending money; we're not stupid."



"I also disagree. The group is already facing a financial shrinkage,and now you want to invest in education? We can't live on ideals alone."



As soon as they heard about spending money, everyone objected.
But due to Isabella's position, they didn't dare to speak out directly and could only make sarcastic remarks.



Isabella didn't care about these. She was here to solve the Wilson Group's predicament, not to compete with everyone. "If you only care about immediate profits, then the money is dead. The Wilson Group got to where it is today because of my grandfather's unique vision and investment, not by hoarding money and not daring to try."



Isabella's words were firm.



She didn't give them a chance to refuse, "Before comning here, I had already reached a cooperation agreement with Nexus Global Enterprises and Hope Haven Foundation on the way. These two have promised that as long as we establish a base locally, they will concentrate their investments, and our problems will be solved. By then, our options won't be limitedto the prosperous areas of southern Valoria but will extend to the entire northern part of southern Valoria."



Everyone was stunned.
They had thought Isabella was just talking.


They didn't expect her to have thought out the plan, strategy, and future so clearly.



She was indeed the heir personally groomed by Daniel.



This kind of execution power was not something ordinary people possessed.



Moreover,Nexus Global Enterprises and Hope Haven Foundation were both well-established companies in southern Vaoria,especially Hope Haven Foundation, which had strong government support.



Even if they cooperated, there would be no conflicts with the Brown Group.



Securing sponsorship from these two companies would fundamentally eliminate many troubles.


It was a real move into the southern Valoria industry.
"As for the ownership of that island, let the Brown Group have it.Once our group is firmly established in southern Valoria,we will settle the score." Isabella squinted her eyes, slowly turning the sapphire ring on her finger.



"That may be true, but southern Valoria is the Brown Family's territory. If we just leave, outsiders will think we conceded to Michael and ran off to the remote northern Valoria to develop."



Although Daniel and Aiden had a deep friendship,things were different now.



The Brown Group was now controlled by Michael.



Business was brutal, with interests at the forefront. Who would care about the previous generation's friendship? Moreover,the Wilson Group's expansion into the south was kept secret by Daniel.



No one would know unless it was mentioned.



"Who said I conceded?" Isabella slammed her hand on the table, her fighting spirit ignited, "Just wait and see. The southern Valoria
market will definitely bear the Wilson Group's name in the future."


A year ago, Daniel brought the company to southern Valoria for her.



For three years, she was alone in Evergreen City. Daniel was worried she would be bullied without support, so he made this decision a year ago.



"Today, I let the Brown Group take a step. In the future, I will make Michael willingly return everything a hundredfold!"



It wasn't just the Wilson Group's feud but also her three-year marrige.



She would make Michael return everything.



The room fell silent.


No one raised objections.
Isabella was indeed the heir personally groomed by Daniel.


Her courage was strong enough.


She wasn't even afraid of a devil like Michael.



"By the way, I forgot to tell you, my grandfather's health was not good a few days ago, but he had surgery last night, and it was very successful. If any of you are not optimistic about the Wilson Group's future development, you can resign now, and I will buy back the shares at the highest price. But..." Isabella paused, her gaze sweeping over everyone with a sense of pressure. "If anyone dares to cause trouble within the company at this time, I may not be able to do anything to you, but my grandfather is different. He has always hated betrayal, especially from those close to him. You should know better than me what he would do."



As soon as she finished speaking, the large conference room fell into a deathly silence.



Everyone's expressions varied, but they were all pale.
Especially the older shareholders.


Who wouldn't shiver at the thought of Daniel's ruthlessness back then? Someone who climbed from the bottom to the top couldn't be an ordinary person.



Although hitting people was illegal, Daniel didn't need to lift a finger to make someone disappear from Evergreen City.



Everyone was completely convinced this time.



They no longer dared to have any objections.



After a whole morning of meetings, Isabella returned to her office,exhausted with a sore neck, eyes, and head.



But the end of the meeting didn't mean the problems were solved.



She still had to review the documents and contracts sent by the secretarial department one by one.
###Chapter 33 What If Isabella Finds Out


Chris was helping on the side, looking at the documents and said,"Ms. Taylor, the project on compassionate education and healthcare proposed at the meeting earlier, the planning department suggests getting a celebrity to endorse it to maximize the benefits."



Isabella nodded after hearing this, "That's a good idea. The spokesperson should be someone well-known and reputable, so we can trial it on multiple platforms later. Does the planning department have any suitable candidates?"



Chris found the previously submitted proposal from the documents.



Isabella opened the first page and the first name she saw was Bianca.



A series of praises and awards were listed below.


"A piano prodigy returned from abroad..." Isabella sneered. She had to admit that the industry was quite murky these days. Bianca,being a mistress who was keen on stealing other people's husbands.
had become a hot star.


Not to mention, her endorsement fees were very high.



From Chris's angle, he only saw a photo on top and assumed Isabella didn't like Bianca, so he mentioned another candidate.



A newly awarded star in the industry, Calla Griffin.



She had decent skills, and since she was a newcomer,her endorsement fee was low.



Only half of Bianca's.



Isabella looked through it carefully and made a decision, "Let's go with her, Calla. The first one is out of consideration."



"Alright." Chris put away the documents, removed Bianca's profile from the file, and threw it directly into the trash can.
He clearly saw Isabella's disgust earlier. "Ms. Taylor,tonight is your first day back with the Wilson Family. The Wilson Group will host a charity banquet at the best hotel in Evergreen City tonight. As the current head of the Wilson Group, you need to attend. Additionally,the Brown Family will also be invited."



"Okay, I got it."



Upon learning that she was removed from the Wilson Group's endorsement and permanently cut off from cooperation, Bianca was so angry that she threw everything in the room to the floor.



Ever since she encountered that bitch Isabella, her luck had been extremely bad.



After studying abroad for three years, she thought she could rely on Michael's favoritism to drive Isabella out of the Brown Family and take the position of Mrs. Brown.



But she never expected Isabella to be so bold as to climb into Michael's bed in the middle of the night.
That photo of the two passionately kissing made her want to kill Isabella every time she looked at it.



Michael should have been her man.



Isabella stole him from her.



Since Isabella sent that photo, she had wanted to meet Michael countless times to ask what really happened that night.



But for some reason, Michael never answered her calls.



He didn't even reply to her messages.


She had tried calling Isabella, but that bitch had blocked her.


She always thought Michael cared about her, Otherwise, he wouldn't have helped the Scott Family just because of her words. But she never expected...
This morning, she received news that the entire Scott Family had disappeared overnight in Evergreen City.



And the person behind it was Michael.



How could she not be jealous? So she had her agent deliberately submit her profile to the Wilson Group, the current rival of the Brown Group.



She just wantedto get Michael's attention.



She just needed him to coax her a little.



But now, she, a dignified piano prodigy, was rejected by an insignificant small company.



Simply outrageous.



Bianca called her agency to ask why and learned that it was because the Wilson Group had a new president, who had removed her endorsement.
She was even angrier.


"What Wilson Family heir? Who knows where this imposter came from, not even recognizing me." Bianca's eyes turned red with anger at whatever the agent said on the other end, "A person who disappeared for three years, isuddenly reappears and becomes the heir of the entire Wilson Group!"



Outside the door, Harper heard Bianca's venomous cursing and quickly covered the phone, giving her a look.



With a gentle voice, she walked in, "Bianca, Mrs. Brown is looking for you."



Bianca hurriedly hung up her phone, took Harper's phone, and instantly transformed into a well-behaved and obedient persona.



On the call, Stella informed her that there would be a grand charity banquet at the Evergreen City hotel tonight.



Anyone with status in the business world would attend.
Naturally, Michael would be there too, but he happened to be in need of a suitable and sensible companion.



Stella immediately thought of Bianca.


Bianca was, of course, willing to see Michael.



Even if he and Isabella had a moment of impulsive intimacy, she still believed it was all Isabella's fault for seducing Michael.



Moreover, attending such an event would not only allow her to get close to Michael but also benefit her career.



Tonight, she wanted to be the most dazzling leading lady at the event.



By then, Michael's eyes would surely be on her.



After hanging up the phone, Bianca went to a luxury store to purchase an expensive dress and jewelry that would highlight her status.
Meanwhile, at the top floor of the Brown Group building, Michael received a call personally from Chris.



The ownership of the joint development project of the offshore island with the Brown Group was terminated.



In the office, Michael hung up the phone with a dark expression,a cold smile playing on his lips.



This outcome was unexpected.



The Wilson Group was a company on the brink of collapse,yet they had the audacity to take another gamble at this point.



The reason for this change was merely because of an unknown "Miss Wilson."



"Mr. Brown,the Wilson Family has sent an invitation to the banquet. It's said that the mysterious heir of the Wilson Group will also be present. Moreover, to attract attention and investment, they are showcasing a treasured item that the Wilson Family has kept for years as the highlight of the event." Aaron reported everything in
detail.



Michael, staring at the stock price trends on his computer, had little interest in this Miss Wilson.



But she shouldn't have harmed his interests.



Losing something that was almost in his grasp made him very angry.



The consequences would be severe.



Michael's eyes darkened, "You sure that the Wilson Family heir will attend the banquet?"



Aaron said, "There's a ninety percent chance. This banquet also serves another purpose: to announce the new president of the Wilson Group to the public. Even the auction item is said to be one of the most important treasures of this heir. The reason for the auction is unclear, but it shows how much the WVilson Family values this banquet."
That mysterious heir would definitely appear.



Just as Michael was about to nod, Aaron suddenly reminded him in a low voice, "Additionally, Mr. Brown, Mrs. Stella Brown called earlier, asking you to bring Ms. Taylor to the banquet and to bid on the highlight item as an engagement gift for Ms. Taylor."



Michael frowned.



After a moment, he raised his hand and instructed, "Follow Mrs.Stella Brown's arrangements. Tonight, I want to see who this Wilson Family heir really is."



Hearing this, Aaron was stunned, "Mr. Brown, are you sure you want Ms. Taylor to attend? If Mrs. Isabella Brown finds out..."



Isabella was already very sensitive about their relationship.



It had reached the point of divorce. If Michael continued to stir things up...
###Chapter 34 Charity Gala


"Since when does she not know my whereabouts?" Michael,feeling irritated, tugged at his tie. "Since I can't hide it, let's just do what needs to be done."



Aaron immediately understood. "Yes, Mr. Brown. I'll discreetly let Mrs. Brown know about tonight's banquet."



Michael was once again trying to provoke Isabella's sense of crisis.



But he always felt that this method might work once or twice, but over time, wouldn't it make Isabella more likely to leave him?



At 9 PM, the charity banquet was held on the top floor of The Grand Majestic Hotel.



It was said that the last time this floor was reserved was when a royal family from a certain country visited, and the hotel made an exception to allow a two-hour event.
This time, the Wilson Family had reserved the entire evening.


The power behind this was evident.



Because of the high standards here, even the reception staff and waiters were dressed in high-end custom uniforms that couldn't be seen elsewhere, and they had to meet certain appearance and body proportion requirements.



Both men and women wore light blue uniforms, carried themselves elegantly, and behaved appropriately, making them quite pleasing to the eye.



So when Bianca appeared in a light blue evening gown, it was particularly awkward.



The Taylor Family was also an upper-middle-class family, but she rarely attended such events, let alone the top floor of the hotel that was never easily accessible to outsiders.



She had spent nearly a million dollars to choose a dress that would highlight her gentle demeanor.
The color of the dress clashed with the uniforms of the waitstaff.making her feel very embarrassed.



Standing next to Michael, she gritted her teeth, wanting to turn and leave, but she couldn't bear to leave Michael.



Michael didn't say anything.



His gaze didn't linger on her for more than a second.


Michael's appearance caused a huge stir at the event.



Just mentioning the name Michael was enough to send chills down people's spines in Evergreen City.



After a brief speech, the charity banquet began on time.



Everyone instinctively made way for the best seats, and Michael sat down without hesitation, while Bianca shyly took a seat next to him.
Their intimate behavior naturally drew a lot of attention, and some reporters even took out their cameras and started snapping photos.



After all, their relationship had been the subject of speculation before.



This time, Michael bringing Bianca as his date was almost an acknowledgment of their rekindled romance.



Noticing the photographers, Bianca subtly leaned closer to Michael,using the angle to make it look like they were kissing in public.



Strangely, this time Michael didn't stop the reporters from taking photos.



In the past, their relationship was only rumored within the elite circles, and the media didn't dare to reveal anything due to Michael's power and influence.



But today, with Michael's "indulgence," their relationship was now confirmed.
"Michael, I recently applied to be the spokesperson for the Wilson Group's project, but their new CEO removed me. I don't know if I offended her somehow. Can you heIp me?" Bianca gently tugged at Michael's sleeve, her voice soft and coquettish.



Michael glanced at her, his voice cold. "Do you think I'm close with her?"



"But isn't Aiden..."



"In business, there's no room for personal relationships. The Wilson Group and I are competitors now!" Michael withdrew his hand and leaned back.



"I really didn't know that." Bianca bit her lip and apologized."Michael, if I had known about the competition between you two,I wouldn't have applied to the Wilson Group. So, is the new CEO of the Wilson Group hostile towards me because she knows about our relationship?"


Bianca didn't say anything more.
She just needed to shift the conflict to the Wilson Group,and Michael would naturally back her up.



"It's just a spokesperson role. I'll have Aaron arrange something else for you." When Michael was a child, he was kidnapped and nearly killed, and it was Bianca who took a fatal blow for him.



This left her physically weak for years.



So as long as she didn't go too far, he would generally accommodate her.



But only with money.



And Bianca was well aware of this, which was why she could repeatedly test Michael's limits.


Her only regret was that three years ago, she didn't use this to successfully sleep with Michael, giving Isabella an opportunity.


But as long as she was around, Isabella would never be able to enter
Michael's heart.



As long as she had the patience to wait, becoming Michael's wife was only a matter of time.



After tonight, everyone would know that she, Bianca, was the one Michael loved.



Isabella was just a lowly person, unloved and unwanted.



Isabella was no match for Bianca.



Just like now.



Bianca was sitting next to Michael.



Under the spotlight, Bianca enjoyed the honor of being Michael's date until the auction reached its climax.



At that moment, the smile on Bianca's face instantly disappeared.
It was replaced by shock and anger.


All the flashlights focused on the center of the stage, where a man and a woman slowly walked out from behind the scenes. They were the hosts of the banquet, the Wilson Family members.



Isabella, in a black sequined mermaid gown, walked to the center of the stage, holding Thomas's arm.



She had a strong presence, and the lighting and her dress only accentuated her noble aura as an heir.



Especially the big red diamond necklace on her collarbone.



Just the luster and size of it made everyone present gasp.


Thomas, in an elegant white tailcoat, stood beside Isabella like a noble knight protecting her.



Particularly the way he looked at Isabella, with tenderness and affection.
The two of them standing together looked like a beautiful painting,a handsome man and a beautiful woman, extremely pleasing to the eye.



Sitting in the front row, Bianca was almost blinded by Isabella's nobility, and jealousy and hatred grew wildly in her heart.


Why was it Isabella standing there?



That glory should belong to her.



"Michael, look, isn't that Isabella? How can she be so close with another man, and a member of the Wilson Family at that." Bianca turned her head, and Michael's face instantly darkened.



His whole body exuded an unrestrained hostility.



So, Thomas was a member of the Wilson Family. No wonder Thomas dared to go against him, even insisting on representing Isabella in the divorce case despite his threats.
Seeing this, Bianca was even more furious. Seeing Isabella doing better than her was worse than death.



She bit her lip and said, "Michael, Isabella hasn't officially divorced you yet. Now she's openly appearing with another man. Isn't she blatantly disrespecting you? If this gets out, the Brown Family's reputation will be ruined by her."



Bianca put on a concerned expression for Michael. She didn't believe that Isabella could stay in the Brown Family this time.
###Chapter 35 Securing 950 Million Dollars


Bianca said, "Should I go remind Isabella?"



Bianca said as she was about to get up, but Michael's deep voice stopped her, "Leave her be. If she dares to do such a thing, she should know the consequences!"



Michael's eyes were practically on fire.



Isabella had just signed an agreement with him and dared to boldly link arms with Thomas. If he didn't get angry, did she think he didn't exist?



He came here to meet the mysterious heir of the Wilson Group who had offended him.



It turned out to be Thomas.



And he brought Isabella to make an appearance. These two really didn't take Michael seriouly.
Michael clenched his fists.


Seeing Michael's face darken bit by bit, Bianca felt secretly pleased.



This time, she didn't believe Isabella could still compete with her for the position of Michael's wife.



How could a woman as indiscreet as Isabella be worthy of her Michael? In this world, only she, Bianca, was the most suitable woman for him.



Meanwhile, everyone present was speculating about the identities of the two people on stage.



Thomas had considerable influence abroad, and many people recognized him.



"Who would have thought that the famous trader in the financial market, Thomas, is actually from the Wilson Family!"


"But who is that sexy companion standing next to him? Her aura is
no less than Thomas's. She doesn't look like someone from the entertainment industry, but her face is stunningly beautiful."



"Could she be a secretly groomed superstar from some entertainment company, taking this opportunity to make an appearance in front of the media? All the top elites are here today;getting to know any of them could make her success."



"Do you think she might be the mysterious lady of the Wilson Family, the only acknowledged heir of the Wilson Family?"



"What nonsense! If she were really the heir of the Wilson Family,how could she not reveal her identity first? Didn't you see the two of them holding hands intimately? It's clearly an ambiguous relationship."



"That's true, but the heir of the Wilson Family is indeed mysterious.She suddenly disappeared for three years and now has taken over the Wilson Group, yet she is too lazy to even make an appearance."



Even though Isabella was standing on stage, everyone seemed to have reached a consensus.
They all believed that the once domineering Isabella in the eastern part of Valoria could not possibly be willing to stand behind Thomas.



And Isabella wouldn't explain.



She had no intention of exposing her true identity.



That would only bring her endless trouble and hassle.



However, her appearance today was to showcase the Wilson Family's prized collection.



It was the big fiery red diamond around her neck, a treasure of unparalleled purity and rarity.



This was also one of the treasures Daniel had left her.



Today,she would auction off this diamond necklace and donate all the proceeds to education and healthcare in remote areas.
The starting price was fifty million dollars.


Isabella personally showcased it.



With the auctioneer's call, everyone suddenly realized that Isabella was just a model displaying the product.



The spotlight fell on Isabella's delicate collarbone, making the red diamond appear pure and dazzling.



"One hundred million dollars."



"One hundred and fifty million dollars."



Each bid made the audience gasp. Many were just watching the excitement, not daring to keep bidding.


"Four hundred million dollars!" Thomas elegantly spoke, wearing gold-rimmed glasses, looking both refined and noble.
Thomas wouldn't let Isabella really auction her treasure to cover the group's internal losses.



It was just a show for outsiders; naturally, he would take it back afterward.



He didn't want Isabella to suffer any grievances.



"Six hundred million dollars!" The bidder was Michael.



Hearing this number, the whole room was in an uproar.



Michael's gaze swept over, provocatively looking at Thomas and Isabella beside him, a disdainful smile on his lips.



He was determined to get the diamond necklace around Isabella's neck.



Seeing Michael's deliberate gaze, Thomas squinted and exchanged a glance with Isabella.
Isabella nodded slightly to him.


Thomas spoke, "Six hundred and fifty million dollars."



"Seven hundred million dollars!" Michael followed closely.



The price had already far exceeded the item's actual value,and others could see that Michael was going head-to-head with the Wilson Family.



They all wwithdrew from the auction.



The auction continued, and under Isabella's signal, the two men competed fiercely, raising the price of a diamond necklace valued at three hundred million dollars to nine hundred million dollars.



When Michael wanted to bid again, Bianca,trembling with fear,tried to stop him.



That was several hundred million dollars, but to them,it seemed worthless.
Thomas didn't continue.


In the end, Michael won the diamond necklace for nine hundred and fifty million dollars.



The title of charity ambassador came to Michael.



Isabella blinked and decisively took off the diamond necklace around her neck, handing it to the staff, "I never expected Mr.Brown to have such a charitable heart."



How could Michael not see it?



This was a trap set by the two of them to provoke him into buying the item.



A mere few hundred million dollars.



It wasn't something he cared about.
He just couldn't stand seeing Isabella smiling beside Thomas;her smile for Thomas was blinding.



"I wasn't planning to let it go. This necklace should have been yours, but it didn't work out." Thomas whispered to Isabella.



He felt bad but didn't want to go against Isabella's wishes.


He reached out to touch her head as usual, then looked up at Michael, his eyes darkening, his tone mocking. "I'm suprised by Mr.Brown's willingness to help children in impoverished areas.However, I still want to thank you.on behalf of the Wilson Group for your nine hundred and fifty million dollar contribution."



With this money, the Wilson Group almost didn't need to touch the company's internal funds to smoothly get through the current difficulties.



Coming up with this brilliant idea, Isabella was indeed remarkable.



Michael's eyes flashed with a dark light, not provoked by Thomas's words.
Instead, he slowly curled his lips, "Just a small amount of money,consider it the Brown Group's contribution to society.But Mr.Wilson, your business hasn't been going well lately,has it?"



Both men wore smiles, but everyone could hear the intense tension between them.



Moreover, Michael's words pointed out the truth.



Thomas couldn't help but frown. He had indeed been held up by his business in the past few days.



His company over there had been frequently reported, and with Eldoria's strict laws in some areas, he had to pull some strings to smooth things over.



At the time, he thought he had unintentionally offended some local power.


Now it seemed that all of this was orchestrated by Michael.
###Chapter 36 Take Off Your Clothes


Thomas calmnly arranged for Isabella to be elsewhere, took a glass of red wine from the waiter, and stood in front of Michael.



With a faint, cold smile, he said, "Mr. Brown, you really have a long reach. But have you forgotten who I am? Even if my overseas business is affected, I still have the Wilson Family behind me. Worst case,I'll just go home and help manage the family business. But before I leave, I will make sure my team of lawyers wins this divorce case."



"Is that so?" Michael raised an eyebrow, indifferent. "Then go ahead and try."



The powerful aura between the two clashed intensely.



Bianca, sitting nearby, was treated as if she were invisible.


This made her feel very uncomfortable.
Isabella also emerged from the crowd. After her stunning appearance earlier, she had become the star of the night.


Wherever she went, all eyes followed.



Some even subtly inquired about her relationship with Thomas,wondering if they were really a couple. Isabella just smiled and didn't give a direct answer.



When she lifted her skirt and walked towards Michael,Bianca,sitting beside him, suddenly paled.



She had become a mere backdrop.



Both Michael and Thomas, with his commanding presence,couldn't help but turn their gaze towards Isabella.



Tonight, she was as beautiful as an angel.



Bianca's face turned even paler. She wanted to pull Michael away before Isabella arrived.
But Michael shook her off and walked straight to Isabella,blocking her path. "Come with me, I have something to tell you."



Isabella didn't move, her words laced with sarcasm. "Mr. Brown,what's this about? Do you have to be so secretive? Is it something that can't be seen in the light of day?"



Michael's face immediately darkened.



In front of everyone, he grabbed Isabella and pulled her into his arms,walking away.



Everyone was shocked.


The two had a secret marriage, and apart fromn close friends,few people knew Isabella was Mrs. Brown.



Now, Michael had just taken Isabella away, causing quite a stir.


Michael casually opened a lounge and pushed Isabella inside.
Isabella stumbled, almost twisting her ankle. "Michael, are you crazy? Your beloved Bianca is ouItside. Why did you drag me here?"



Didn't he care about what people would say about Bianca now?



Isabella looked up angrily, her black tight-fitting mermaid dress accentuating her figure. At this moment, Isabella seemed to be glowing.



Michael said, "Isabella, I think you've forgotten who you are.We haven't divorced yet. As Mrs. Brown, you should be staying at home instead of going out dressed like this to seduce other men. I think you're the one who's crazy!"



She seducing men?



He could say that without even thinking.


Of course, in his heart, she would never compare to Bianca.


He even defaulted to having Bianca as his companion.
Isabella looked up and laughed lightly. "So you know we haven't divorced yet. You can spend billions of dollars to please Bianca,but I have to stay home and wait for you, right? Or are you regretting the money you just spent and are now angry?"



Her voice was light, filled with sarcasm.



Michael's eyes narrowed. He closed the door and pressed her against the wall, trapping her from.behind.



He was so tall that he easily enveloped her.



He leaned close to her ear and sneered, "Billions of dollars mean nothing. If you don't care, then even tens of billions wouldn't matter."



Isabella tried to move, but he anticipated it and grabbed her wrists,pulling her tightly into his arms.


"Michael, you're crazy. This is a hote1." Isabella exclaimed.
Michael didn't want to hear her talk. Her struggling body made him feel hot all over.



He slapped her firm, tight buttocks, his voice hoarse. "Do you remember the first rule of our agreement? Treating my words like air, do you think I'm a fool, or do you think I have no temper?"



In just a few days, she not only didn't keep her distance from Thomas but also attended the Wilson Family's banquet arm in arm with him.



Michael said, "Are you so eager to. find another man? Do you think the Wilson Family will want you? Don't forget, you've been my wife for three years. Do you think Thomas won't care if you've slept with me?"



"Michael, you pervert, bastard!" Isabella felt helpless.



"Don't rush to curse. There's worse to come. Take off your clothes."Michael coldly ordered.



"What did you say?" Isabella was shocked.
"Don't pretend. You know what I'm saying. Or should I help you take them off?"



Isabella struggled fiercely.


Michael pressed his large hand on her slender waist, biing her lip as he turned his head. "If you don't want to, come with me. Go home now, and I'll spare you this time."



Go home?



Isabella, humiliated by him repeatedly, was furious. "That's your home,not mine."



"Do you want to keep making a scene?" Michael's eyes darkened.He took out his phone and dialed Sean in front of her.


"You should know Sean works for me. I can bring him here,and make him leave. Do you want to try?" Michael's threat was straightforward.
Isabella's face tightened. She almost forgot that Michael still had Sean.



Although DanieI's surgery was successful, his subsequent treatment still depended on Sean.



Sean couldn't leave now!



The phone rang, and Isabella quickly stopped him. "Michael, is this all you can do?"



Michael put away his phone. "Don't forget, you signed the agreement voluntarily. You were the first to break it. When it comes to tricks, I'm no match for you."



Isabella gritted her teeth in anger.


She knew he had no good intentions.


When Daniel recovered, she would definitely get back at him.
As she opened the door, seeing Isabella's exposed chest, Michael's eyes darkened. He draped his coat over her, not allowing any refusal.



He took her hand and walked towards the exit of the banquet.



"Michael, are you leaving?" Seeing them come out of the lounge,Bianca hurriedly chased after them, blocking their way.She bit her lip,looking at Isabella, who was held by Michael.



Her heart was filled with jealousy.



Tonight, her name was on Michael's guest list. Now that she was abandoned,how could she face the social circle in the future?



"Yes, find a ride yourself." Michael didn't hesitate for a moment,pulling Isabella out of the banquet.



Michael took her to the villa outside.


As soon as they entered, Michael threw a delicate box at her, as
casually as throwing away trash.



Isabella immediately recognized it as the red diamond necklace she had auctioned tonight.



The gift box was the one she had taken from home.



"Take it. Something you've worn might not be wanted by anyone else. But it's better than throwing it away." Michael said emotionlessly as he loosened his tie.
###Chapter 37 Bianca Attempts Suicide


Michael's words were harsh, but Isabella was still moved.



Although this money was nothing to the Wilson Group.


But this necklace was a gift from Daniel, and it had a different meaning; she cared about it.



Tonight, she had deliberately conspired with Thomas to harm Michael.



She just wanted to show him that the Wilson Group was not to be trifled with.



But what she didn't expect was that he bought the necklace not to give it to Bianca.



Just now at the banquet, she saw clearly that when Michael bought the necklace, Bianca's eyes lit up.
She looked like she couldn't wait to wear it on the spot.


She found it strange, rubbing the edge of the box, hinting, "You're really giving it to me? Aren't you afraid Bianca will be upset if she likes it too?"



A few hundred million dollars was just a number to Michael, but it was different for Bianca.



Michael walked towards the closet, his gaze sweeping over her, and said sarcastically, "She's not like you. She deserves something more expensive and better. Besides, did I say this necklace was for you? I asked you to hold it for safekeeping, don't overthink it."



Michael turned to choose clothes, a slight smile curling at the corner of his mouth where Isabella couldn't see.



His tone was no longer as cold and domineering as it had been at the banquet, but rather carried a hint of proud affection.



Isabella raised an eyebrow, deliberately walking over and pressing her red lips close to his ear from behind, "So that's how it is. But
since we're still married, any jewelry you bring home that ends up with me will be hard to get back. Or are you saying that in your eyes, I'm more suited for this necklace than Bianca?"



As Isabella said this, her slender fingers slowly slid down his back,almost reaching his waist before Michael grabbed her hand.



Faced with Isabella's blatant teasing, Michael's eyes darkened.



He tightened his grip, trapping her in his arms, his thumb and forefinger pinching her delicate chin, sneering, "I never realized before how self-righteous you are."



Isabella didn't care; she was doing it on purpose.



Her hands were caught, but she lifted her leg to gently rub against his suit pants, feeling his strong body, moving slowly up and down."No matter how self-righteous I am, it's better than your hypocrisy,isn't it? Didn't you bring me back because you wanted to possess me?"



Michael felt hot, and with Isabella deliberately rubbing against him,
he only wanted to shut her up with a kiss.


In fact, he did just that.


His fingers pinched her jaw, and Michael bit her lips, his voice ambiguous between their lips and teeth. "Are you addicted to seducing me?"



For three years of marriage, no matter how she tried to please him,even standing naked in front of him, he didn't want her.



Now that they were about to divorce, he seemed like a different person.



But she was no longer the old Isabella.



She just wanted to see Michael lose control in front of her and make Bianca lose everything.



"Your self-control is just so-so." With that, Isabella wrapped her arms around Michael's neck, pressing herself closer to him, feeling
the burning heat from his body.


Michael's eyes darkened, and he tightened his grip on her waist,deepening the kiss.



Michael lifted Isabella, wrapping her legs around his waist, and took a few steps to the bed, pressing her down.



His eyes were red as he was about to tear off Isabella's sexy mermaid dress when the phone rang.



Michael ignored it, but the caller seemed determined to keep calling until he answered.



He had to pick it up with a dark face.


As soon as he answered.



Bianca's tearful voice came through. "Michael, where are you? I was just..."
Isabella bit Michael's chin, and he glared at her in pain.


She did it on purpose.


Not only that, her hand mischievously moved down his body,directly grabbing Michael's crotch.



She made a surprised and ambiguous sound. "So hard."



Michael's eyes turned red, and he grabbed her hand, his voice hoarse and unbearable, "Isabella, don't move."



"Isabella? Michael, what are you doing? Why is she at your house?"Bianca heard the ambiguous sounds on the phone and was stunned.



Bianca was both anxious and crying, unable to speak clearly. Harper took the phone and tearfully told Michael what had happened.



After Michael took Isabella away, Bianca had planned to take a cab home from the entrance, but she was dragged into a car by a stranger. If it weren't for the police's routine check that saved her
halfway, the consequences would have been unimaginable.


Back home, Bianca cried and threatened to slit her wrists,but Harper stopped her.


They had already taken Bianca to the hospital, but her emotions were very unstable.



"Michael, Bianca only wants to see you now. You can't ignore her. If you don't come to see her tonight, what if something happens..."Harper said.



"Mom, stop forcing Michael. He already has Isabella by his side. It's me who should die!" Bianca screamed hysterically on the phone,"Just let me die. I really don't want to live anymore."



Harper cooperated, "How am I forcing him? If he hadn't invited you to that banquet, you wouldn't have had this happen in the middle of the night. Michael, please have pity on our Bianca. Seeing you is her only hope to live." Harper's acting was much better than Bianca's. She first triggered Michael's guilt, then begged him.
Finally,without saying another word, she and Bianca cried together on the other end.



Michael frowned deeply after hearing this.



Isabella did all this to provoke Bianca, and now that her goal was achieved,she should leave.



Taking advantage of Michael's loosened grip, she tried to escape.


But as soon as she moved, Michael's iron grip held her firmly.



After hanging up the phone, he looked at her with a dark face,lifted her dress, revealing her beautiful legs.



He pressed down on her.



His hardened member, aroused by her teasing, pressed against her,and Isabella was truly panicked.
She only wanted to use this to get back at Bianca, not to get herself involved. "Michael, let me go!"



Michael's body was like a mountain, and Isabella couldn't move at all.



"Where's that seductive energy you had earlier? What,are you scared?" He looked at her with dark eyes, the desire she had stirred up now raging inside him, desperate to find an outlet.



Isabella was frightened by the madness in Michael's eyes, but she also wanted to see if he really didn't care about Bianca.



She suppressed her fear, a smile curling at her lips, "I'm not afraid of anything, but I wouldn't want Bianca to call and threaten suicide halfway through, and then you disappear. That would be such a mood killer."



She wanted to see what he would choose.
###Chapter 38 The Racing God


Some things might be worth scrutinizing, but Isabella didn't care at all.



What she truly didn't believe in was Harper and Bianca, for they were so hypocritical.



And they didn't even consider what level of hotel The Grand Majestic Hotel was, how complex the forces behind it were.Even if someone wanted to harm others, it wouldn't be possible to stage a kidnapping right at the hotel entrance.



Wouldn't that make the hotel a joke?



And then they ran into the police halfway and got rescued. Do they really think everyone was brainless?



But Michael took it seriously.


Michael's face turned cold, but he finally let go of Isabella's hand.
"Ill go check on her. Stay home and don't wander around. Wait for me to come back."



Isabella looked at him, "Michael, do you really have to go? What if I ask you to stay?"



"Isabella, don't be unreasonable. Bianca is not that kind of person."Michael's tone already had a hint of impatience.



Love or not, it was so obvious.



Isabella's eyes turned completely cold as she got her answer, a self-mocking smile tugging at the corner of her mouth.



She was foolish to keep trying to verify something with him, only to end up hurting herself every time.



She brought it upon herself.



The sound of a car engine came from outside, and the whole house fell silent again.
Isabella took out her phone and called her friend Olivia.



"Isabella, what's up?" It was a bit noisy on Olivia's end, and she raised her voice to ask.



Isabella's voice was calm,"Are you free? Join me for a drink, let's celebrate."



"Celebrate?" Olivia lowered her voice, walked to a quiet place, closed the door, and asked with a smile, "Did you win the lottery or get a new man?"



"Today, Bianca slit her wrists and ended up in the hospital. Isn't that worth celebrating?" Isabella said it with great satisfaction.



"Really? Such good news, we definitely need to have a few drinks.Where are you? I'll come get you now. I know a great place. Let's have a blast tonight." Olivia's eyes lit up when she heard the news.



She had been meaning to talk to Isabella about this, but Isabella called her first.
Olivia arrived quickly, and Isabella had already changed into casual clothes and was waiting downstairs.



Seeing Olivia step out of the car in a tight white racing suit, Isabella was stunned.



She thought Olivia had just come from some cosplay event. "Weren't we going to a bar? You're wearing that?"



Olivia excitedly spun around to show off her new outfit to Isabella,"I forgot to tell you, my favorite racer Ivan Franklin has a race tonight at Sunset Ridge Highway. I got the best seats, just waiting to meet Ivan face-to-face."



Isabella was surprised again.



Although Olivia had been in the entertainment industry for a few years,with her family's protection, she had never faced any pressure or been subjected to any unspoken rules.



So,at twenty-two, Olivia had never had a real relationship.
All these years. she had only liked characters from games and anime.



No real person had ever entered her life.


Isabella felt both gratified and emotional, "You've grown up. In the blink of an eye,you're old enough to date."



"Come on, don't make me sound so childish. I'll be twenty-three after this birthday. If I don't start dating now,there must be something wrong with me." Olivia said.



Isabella couldn't help but laugh, "I didn't say you couldn't date.You should go for Ivan and make him your boyfriend."



"That's impossible. Besides, I just want to race him tonight. I don't dare think about anything else." Mentioning Ivan made Olivia shy.



The two chatted as they got into the car and headed to Sunset Ridge Highway.
Meanwhile,Michael arrived at the hospital.


From the phone call, he thought Bianca was seriously injured. He had to harden his heart to leave Isabella at home.



But it turned out Bianca's hand was only slightly scratched.It wasn't even a wrist-slitting; a paper cut would have been worse.



Michael didn't say anything, but his expression wasn't good.



After comforting Bianca, Michael planned to leave, but Bianca clung to him, refusing to let go, her emotions extremely unstable.



Thinking of Isabella waiting at home, Michael recalled her last calm question, "Can you stay?"



For the first time, he felt a sense of reluctance.



He wanted to call her to ask what she was doing, but at that moment, Bianca suddenly fainted.
Isabella only found out after arriving that Olivia had not only prepared a cool racing suit for herself but also one for Isabela.



She even had a motorcycle ready.


"Why do I feel like you set me up, just waiting for me to fall into your trap?" Isabella clearly told Olivia they were going for a drink.



But she ended up being brought to a racing event by Olivia.


And Olivia had even prepared clothes and a bike in advance.



"It's just a coincidence." Olivia quickly diverted Isabella's attention,"Besides, who says celebrating at night can only involve drinking?Racing is so thrilling. The excitement of winning is even better than drinking."



Isabella stared at her without saying a word:


Olivia pouted and clung to Isabella's arm, gently shaking it.
"Isabella, I really didn't trick you. I've been chasing Ivan for a long
time. I really like him. Can you help me this time?"


"Tell me what do you want me to do first." Isabella asked.


Olivia bit her lip and explained everything.



It turned out that Olivia had been watching a racing event with friends recently and was captivated by a racer.



After some inquiries, she found out the first-place winner was Ivan,a college student.



But Ivan was quite aloof, not liking to go out or participate in any activities, only interested in racing.


So, Olivia thought of Isabella.



Back in the east Valoria, Isabella was the strongest racer in the circle.
No one dared to race three laps with her.


So, Olivia spread the word that the racing goddess from the east Valoria would be participating in a race and even sent Ivan a challenge letter.



She was thinaking about how to contact Isabella when Isabella called her first.



So, Olivia directly brought Isabella to the racing event.



She said, "Isabella, I'm not lying. Ivan is really handsome on the track, absolutely mesmerizing."



Whenever he appeared, everyone else faded into the background.



Mentioning Ivan made Olivia look completely smitten.


"Alright, Ivan isn't here yet. Wipe your drool. Since we're here,let's just have some fun." Isabella was in a bad mood, and a night breeze might do her good.
###Chapter 39 Running a Lap Naked


Racing was something she got into during her teenage years.


At that time, Daniel was busy with the Wilson Group business.
Fearing she might get bored, he hired a professional instructor for her. Coupled with her extraordinary talent,she reached a
professional level in just one summer.



She even participated in a few private races with her instructor.



But she only treated it as a hobby and interest. She liked the feeling of chasing the wind, nothing more.



Later, her instructor invited her to participate in professional races,but she declined.



She didn't want Daniel to worry, nor did she want her identity to be too conspicuous.


"Really? that's great." Olivia was overjoyed. When she came, she was
worried Isabella might be unhappy with her decision.


Just then, Isabella received a message.



As soon as she saw the avatar, Isabella frowned. Wasn't Bianca causing a scene and threatening to commit suicide at the hospital?What kind of scheme was she up to now?



She casually opened it, and the moment she saw the picture, a cold smile appeared on her lips.



No surprise, the picture showed Bianca being comforted by Michael.



Bianca's eyes were red from crying, and Michael was gently soothing her.



Michael looked very doting.


It wasn't hard to guess who took the photo.
After all, Bianca and Harper were a team, and Michael hadIn't noticed anything amiss.



Seeing him like this, he probably wouldn't come home tonight.


Fine, he could comfort Bianca.



She would race.



Deleting the picture swiftly, Isabella put on the custom helmet Olivia handed her. Her sexy figure was fully revealed in her tight outfit,exuding a powerful aura.



Not long after, the Ivan Olivia mentioned really appeared at the racetrack.



With a beautiful spin, the car stopped in front of them.



Ivan, with long legs on the ground and wearing a black helmet, had eyes that hinted at a handsome face.
Ivan was young, well-built, good-looking, and a racer, hitting every point of Olivia's aesthetic.



No wonder she fell for Ivan at first sight.



With twenty minutes left before the race, Isabella noticed Ivan secretly observing her and Olivia.



"Which one of you is from east Valoria?" Ivan asked, puzzled.



Both Isabella and Olivia had top-notch figures, making it easy to imagine how beautiful their faces must be under the helmets.



But Isabella found the voice somewhat familiar.



However, thinking that no one around her raced, she didn't dwell on it.



Hearing Ivan's voice, Olivia nervously grabbed Isabella's hand.Isabella smiled and raised her chin at Ivan, "You'll know after the race."
Hearing Isabella's voice, Ivan was visibly stunned, then quickly took out his phone and snapped a photo of Isábella.



"Taking photos without permission, don't you have any manners?"If it weren't for Olivia, Isabella would have been angry.



"It's just a photo for memory, don't overthink it." Ethan didn't feel embarrassed at all.



His fingers quickly tapped twice, sending the photo to Michael's phone.



At the same time, Michael had just left the hospital. The doctor said there was nothing wrong with Bianca's fainting.



But when he got home,he found Isabella missing.



Just as he was about to go out and look for her, he received the photo from Ethan in the car.



Ethan:[Mr.Brown, look at this beauty I photographed. This figure,
these eyes, don't they look like Isabella? I'm telling you,even the voice is similar. I was stunned when I heard it.]



Michael: [Where is this?]



Ethan: [I'm racing at Sunset Ridge Highway. Hey, you can't come.I'm determined to win today. These two beauties are just my type,and I want them both.]



Michael:[I doubt you have the skills!]



Ethan didn't care. To secretly race, he had specifically taken on a college student's identity.



He usually didn't show his face, claiming to be in class, actually fearing being seen and having his true identity revealed.



The Martinez Family, being a prestigious family, had few members.If his family knew he was doing such dangerous activities outside,they might lock him up for life.
Their wish was to see him follow the family's plan step by step, take over the business, get married, and have children.


Preferably without making any mistakes.


But he didn't want that. Living like that for a lifetime was worse than death.



On the other side.



Michael stared at the photo on his phone. He didn't need to zoom in to recognize Isabella.



Isabella had just slipped from his grasp two hours ago;he couldn't possibly not recognize her.



If she wanted to race, he would race with her.


As the race was about to start, Ethan suddenly raised his hand,"Wait a minute, I have a friend coming to join. He's the real Southern Racing God of Valoria. You'll get to see him soon, don't
say I didn't give you a chance."



Mentioning Michael's racing skills, Ethan's tone unconsciously carried pride.



As soon as he finished speaking, a custom-made black motorcycle stopped at the starting line.



The maneuver was agile and graceful.



"Indeed impressive." Isabella raised an eyebrow, a hint of admiration in her eyes.



She didn't expect to encounter such a professional opponent just by coming to have some fun. But before she could be too happy,when she saw the eyes under the helmet, she was taken aback.



Deep, cold eyes, like an abyss.


It was Michael.
She had loved him for over a decade; she couldn't be mistaken.


Why wasn't he at the hospital with Bianca at this time? What was he doing here?


Couldn't he let her have a good time?



However, the fact that Michael could race was quite surprising to her.



After all, since marrying him, she hadn't seen him have any hobbies other than work.



"Tonight's race gathers the Eastern and Southern Racing Gods of Valoria, and they're all handsome men and beautiful women.
Wouldn't it be a shame if there were no rewards for this race?" The one hyping up the atmosphere was the referee.



He was also found by Ethan.


"That's not difficult. I suggest if the girls lose,they treat everyone
here to dinner. If the guys lose, they should run a lap on the track naked. How about that?"



The crowd cheered.



Most of those agreeing were guys, focusing on Isabela's sexy figure and face.



Although the suggestion was outrageous, everyone knew Ivan wouldn't lose.



No matter how famous Isabella was, Ivan's skills in Evergreen City were well-known.



Ivan's level was clearly professional, yet he only accepted private races.



Isabella was in a good mood, especially at the thought of someone running naked.


She gestured downwards to Michael, "It's cold, don't catch a cold
when you take off your clothes later!"


She relished the chance to openly humiliate Michael.



"Catching a cold is impossible. I'm waiting for you to treat me alone!" Seeing Isabella's smug look, Michael could easily guess how bright her smile was at that moment.
###Chapter 40 The Nominal Father Indigo


Time was ticking down, and upon hearing Michael's words, Isabella smirked coldly.



She made up her mind to let Michael lose.



The signal to start was given, and within asecond,a dozen race cars shot off the starting line, leaving only excited spectators and a cloud of white smoke behind.



Olivia's car malfunctioned shortly after the start, forcing her to return to the starting point.



She maintained a good attitude, knowing that even if she chased after them, she wouldn't catch a glimpse of Ivan. So, she stayed back and used a drone to monitor the road conditions.



Hundreds of motorcycle enthusiasts had gathered at the mountaintop, eager to witness the two racers in action.
The entire race was incredibly thrilling.



After the first turn, the racer who appeared in the lead was surprisingly Michael, who had started last.



Not only did he easily overtake Ivan, but he also left Isabella far behind.



But Isabella was not willing to admit defeat.



At the most likely spot for overtaking on a curve, she caught up to Michael at an extremely high speed and overtook him on the outside.



The car roared as it sped up, and Isabella pressed the car so low that she was almost parallel to the ground.



At this moment, she was less than 15 feet away from a steep slope.



If a landslide occurred, the consequences would be unimaginable.
Michael's heart nearly stopped.



Isabella must be crazy to risk her life just to win. If something went wrong, she wouldn't stand a chance of surviving.



He was genuinely afraid for her safety and deliberately drove closer to the inside, slowing down.



They passed each other side by side.



As Isabella overtook him, she raised her hand and flipped Michael the middle finger.



Michael, with a dark expression, followed closely behind her,watching her skillfully navigate each turn, though her maneuvers were increasingly nerve-wracking.



He had never known she could race, let alone so professionaly.



She was leagues ahead of Ethan, who constantly bragged in front of him.
However, he had no intention of letting her off the hook for what she had just done.



Isabella dared to perform such dangerous stunts just to win a race;if he didn't teach her a lesson, she wouldn't know his limits.



The cars reached the finish line at high speed, and Isabella was surrounded by cheering people.



The other cars arrived one after another.



Seeing Michael, with his long legs, get out of his car and stride towards her with a grim face, Isabella's heart tightened.



She knew he had recognized her. Without waiting to see him strip and run the track, she quickly put her helmet on a nearby girl and ran away.



Everyone there was dressed in racing suits, making it impossible to spot Isabella in the crowd.
As Michael strode over, his intimidating presence made everyone fall silent.



After all, tonight's reward was for the loser to run naked.


But no one dared to mention it because Michael looked ready to tear someone apart.



His gaze was fixed on the winner.



Everyone silently stepped back, clearing a path.


Michael, tall and muscular inhis black tight-fitting suit, exuded a powerful and sexy aura.



He casually tossed his helmet to Ethan.


His handsome face was fully revealed.


Ethan, excited, took out his phone, ready to watch the drama
unfold.


But the crowd gasped and screamed at the sight before them.


"Oh my God!"



The racing god was actually Michael!



The most noble and mysterious man in Evergreen City, the heir to the Brown Family,Michael.



The girl wearing Isabella's helmet almost forgot to breathe as Michael stopped in front of her. His face was simply too perfect.



Moreover,Michael was the racing god of southern Valoria, whom she had dreamed of meeting.



Now, Michael was within arm's reach.


She couldn't believe she wasn't dreaming.
Michael removed his gloves and took off the helmet from the girl's head,his expression changing instantly.



"It's really you. Michael. I love you so much." The girl hugged Michael the moment he took off the helmet, but he pushed her away as soon as she touched his clothes.



Michael exuded coldness, his sharp gaze sweeping towards Ethan.



It was as if he would hold Ethan accountable if he couldn't find her.



Ethan swallowed nervously and quickly asked, "Why are you here?Where's the winner?Where did she go?"



Even Ethan could tell that the girl in front of them was not Isabella.



Did she...run away?



The girl, frightened by their imposing presence, stammered, "I-I don't know who you're talking about."
Ethan immediately understood and pleaded with Michael,"Mr.
Brown, you can't blame me for this. She must have run away because you exposed yourself."



"I'll deal with you later!" Michael shot him a fierce look, turned around, and drove off in pursuit.



Ethan stood there obediently, not daring to mention the bet. When Michael got angry, it was more than he could handle.



Isabella had already reached the foot of the mountain in Olivia's car.



After teasing Michael, she felt much better.



It was a pity she couldn't see Michael strip. If she could have taken a photo,she would have had leverage over him for life.



Just as she entered the city, Isabella's phone rang.


It was her biological father, Indigo.
Years ago, when Daniel took her away. Indigo, her nominal father,became a stranger to her.



But it seemed only she thought so. Ever since she married into the Brown Family three years ago, Indigo had frequently asked Michael for resources.



Later, he realized that Michael cared more about her sister, Bianca,than her.



Only then did Indigo stop trying to "please" her.



The last call was three months ago when Indigo questioned why she hadn't yet conceived a child for the Brown Family, which embarrassed him.



After a few rings, Isabella answered the call, curious about what Indigo wanted this time.


Indigo yelled into the phone, "Isabella, what the hell is wrong with you? It's bad enough you bully Bianca in public, but you dare to seduce Michael in front of her and almost got her hurt. I'm telling
you, Bianca is very upset right now. You come to the hospital and apologize to her in person. If she doesn't forgive you,don't even think about coming home ever again!"



If Isabella were in front of him, he would have slapped her without hesitation.



Isabella pulled over and sneered, "Indigo, I'm not like them. Don't use that commanding tone with me."



Indigo said, "You ungrateful brat, you have no manners. How dare you call me by my name? If you don't come today, I'll make you taste the Taylor Family's rules tomorrow!"



Family rules?


Thinking back to her childhood when Bianca would say, "Isabella broke it..."



Without listening to her explanation,Indigo would slap her hard.
Isabella found it incredibly ironic. "Talking to me about family rules? Don't forget. I stopped being a Taylor the moment I left. But if you insist on me coming over, you better not regret it."







(I highly recommend a captivating book that I couldn't put down for three days and nights. It's incredibly engaging and a must-read.The title of the book is "Escape from the Heartless CEO" You can find it by searching for it in the search bar.)
###Chapter 41 Orphaned and Uncultured


It was Michael, now Indigo..



Bianca, who should have died but didn't, was determined to make the whole world restless.



It would be a waste of her effort if she didn't go see the commotion.



And as for Indigo's scolding, she couldn't just let it go.



Isabella hung up the phone and explained to Olivia, "I need to use your car. I'll take you home first, then head to the hospital."



Olivia, having heard everything, was furious. "Are they out of their minds? It's the middle of the night, and they still can't stop causing trouble?"



"Don't worry, I'm going there to give them trouble." Isabella replied.
Olivia sighed and instinctively checked the rearview mirror. "We should leave quickly. I'm afraid Michael will catch up if we delay."



The race had just ended when she got a call from Isabella saying Michael was coming.



She thought Michael had somehow gotten the news, but Isabella told her that the person racing with her was Michael.



Just then. Michael's call came through.



Isabella gestured for her to stay quiet, answered the call, and spoke in a slightly hoarse voice, as if woken from sleep, "Michael, are you crazy? Why are you calling to harass me so late?"



On the other end, Michael paused, then his cold voice came through,"Where are you?"



He had chased her from home to the racetrack in the middle of the night, only for her to escape.
Michael was now so angry he felt like his lungs would explode.



Isabella chuckled softly, deliberately drawing out her words,"Of course, I'm at home, but soon I'll be heading to the hospital to visit Bianca. They say a wife of Michael must have presence. Since Michael let Bianca call him away in the middle of the night, should I also teach her a lesson like others would?"



Hearing this, Michael's tone immediately darkened, "Why are yrou going to the hospital for no reason? Bianca can't handle the stress."



"I don't care whether she can handle it." Isabella didn't give Michael a chance to respond and decisively ended the call.



At the hospital.


Bianca was sitting on the white hospital bed, wiping her tears and recounting her terrifying ordeal to the camera in a pitiful voice.



She had returned to the country intending to enter the entertainment industry.
And now was the perfect opportunity.


The loose hospital gown made her look even more delicate, and with her pale face and red-rimmed eyes, she presented a beautiful and moving scene on camera.



The live stream audience was filled with sympathy and pity for her,as well as condemnation for the abusers.



Comments flooded the screen.


Just then, the door suddenly opened.



A woman in a burgundy tight dress, stunningly beautiful, appeared on camera.



Isabella had changed clothes and walked over in high heels,her slender legs occasionally visible with her movements, her perfect figure making it hard for anyone to look away.


Bianca's beauty paled in comparison to Isabella's extreme sexiness.
The live stream chat exploded with comments.


[Am I seeing things? This is so thrilling in the middle of the night.
First, there's the delicate Bianca, and now a sexy beauty.]



[Oh my god, this woman's figure is amazing. Is she a celebrity? I'm definitely following her.]



[I can't imagine which man will get to be with such a beauty. If I could marry her, I'd never look at another woman again.]



[Haha, keep dreaming. You'll never get a chance.]



Seeing the live stream audience increase by tens of thousands,Bianca was seething with jealousy.



She had struggled to get a few responses, but Isabella just showed up, and so many people flocked in.



Even so, Bianca maintained a gracious and dignified demeanor.
"Isabella, did you come to see me? It's so late, and as your sister, I
shouldn't have worried you. It's my fault."


Bianca didn't turn off the live stream, so their conversation was clear to everyone watching.



With Isabella's temper, she would definitely speak harshly to her,making Bianca seem even more pitiable.



Sure enough, the next second, Isabella coldly snorted,"Worried? I'm worried you didn't die, so I came to see the show!"



Comments flooded the screen.



[She's Bianca's sister? Why is there so much tension between them?]


[What tension? Can't you see Isabella is doing it on purpose?]



[Don't stop me, I'm going to stand up for Bianca. Isabella is just a vicious sister.]
Indigo walked in just in time to hear Isabella's words and raised her hand to teach her a lesson, but Isabella easily stopped it.



She disdainfully shook her hand, "Didn't you ask me to come?
What's the problem now thatI'm here as you wanted?"



Isabella's indifferent expression made Indigo angry. "So uncultured!After being away for over ten years, you're still the same. If this gets out, it will only ruin the Taylor Family's reputation. Once you get divorced, I'll officially announce that the Taylor Family has nothing to do with you."



"I've already said, I have nothing to do with the Taylor Family.But the ones who will be leaving are you." Isabella coldly looked at Indigo, "Don't think I don't know. The house you're living in belongs to my mother, Grace. With just one wword from me,your whole family will have to get out."


Her only family was Daniel and her uncles.


Where they were was her true home.
The Taylor Family?


She found it disgusting to even step foot there, let alone cherish it.



If they wanted to turn against her, she had no reason to respect them. After all, when she left, she had alreadly severed with her father.



The audience was instantly shocked.



[What kind of plot is this? It's the first time I've seen a daughter kick her father's family out of the house.]



[I heard Isabella is Bianca's half-sister. With such a vicious mouth,who knows how she usually bullies Bianca?]



[Didn't you hear Isabella say she's been away for over ten years?How could she bully her if they don't even meet? Do some people talk without using their brains?]



Many of Bianca's fans started revealing information in the chat
Mostly about how Isabella stole Biancas boytriena michaei three years ago and married him.



And how she bullied Bianca.


One thing after another, as if they were true.



They even mentioned that Isabella was sent to the countryside as a child and never went to school, so where would she get any manners?



Bianca saw this, her eyes instantly reddened. She bit her lip, not daring to say more, as if she was terrified of Isabella.



But Isabella didn't care about that. She was busy arguing with Indigo, making Indigo's face turn ashen with anger.



He clutched her chest.


Isabella said, "Oh, can't handle it? Should I call a doctor to get you an oxygen mask? If that doesn't work, we can send you to the ICU.
They have everything there. If you die, they can even try defibrillation to see if it works!"
###Chapter 42 See You in Court


"Isabella, how can you talk to your father like that? No matter what,he's your elder. You're being way too disrespectful." Bianca looked all gentle and filial.



Isabella raised an eyebrow. "What, are you getting anxious because I didn't scold you? I almost forgot, you have a mother who's a mistress, so you're not much better. You knew I wasn't divorced yet,but you shamelessly seduced Michael, even calling him in the middle of the night to come over. Is this way of seducing men a family tradition or part of your upbringing?"



Isabella insulted Bianca calmly and steadily the whole time.


Bianca was left speechless, her face turning red with anger.


The live stream audience, however, was getting excited.



Some people even started to dislike Bianca and began to like Isabella.
Even just listening to her scold was satisfying.



At the height of the argument, a cold, stern voice interrupted them."Isabella, have you had enough?"



Seeing Michael return,Bianca's eyes lit up, and she cried out,"Michael."



Turning around, she saw Michael in a black trench coat at the door.Isabella couldn't help but raise an eyebrow.



Bianca's position was indeed unshakable.



It hadn't been long, and Michael had rushed over.



In the hospital room, Bianca was crying on the bed, while Indigo sat on the sofa with a dark expression.



"Oh, you really came?" Isabella feigned surprise, looking at Michael without a hint of fear.
After all these years, if she still couldn't see through Michael,she would be blind.



"Michael,you don't know what Isabella just called me. I really didn't do any of those things. You have to believe me." Bianca trembled as she reached out to grab Michael's sleeve,crying pitifully.



As if she had been subjected to inhumane treatment.



"I know, don't take her words to heart." Michael didn't pull away,gently comforting Bianca.



Seeing the live stream on his phone, his expression darkened.



Bianca quickly turned it off.



Isabella naturally didn't give Michael a chance to question her. She had said everything she wanted to say and felt much better.



Staying any longer would be pointless.
"You two like sticking together so much, I'll give you some space.Go on!" Isabella sneered, turned around, and left with big strides.



She slammed the door behind her, and Michael couldn't miss the anger radiating from her.



He frowned and immediately shook off Bianca. "Take care of yourself. I'm leaving."



Seeing Michael go after Isabella and leave her behind, Bianca couldn't stand it. "Michael, are you going after her again? Can't you see that Isabella doesn't like you at all? Otherwise, why would she be so determined to divorce you?"



Michael's face darkened. "So what?"



Bianca's face turned pale.



Even if Isabela didn't like him, he wanted to keep her by his side.Could it be that Michael really liked Isabella?



Bianca panicked and reached out to grab Michael's hand. "Michael,please don't leave me. You're all I have."


Bianca's tone was humble. But Michael didn't respond at all,shaking her off and leaving.



Michael intercepted Isabella in the parking lot downstairs.


He coldly questioned, "Where did you go tonight?"



He knew the person racing against him was Isabella, but he wanted her to admit it.



"Where was I? I was obviously at the hospital visiting Bianca.Didn't you see?" Isabella retorted.



"Really?" Michael squinted, stepping forward to trap her between the car door and himself. "Was the night breeze on Sunset Ridge Highway thrilling?"
He didn't miss the flash of panic in Isabella's eyes.


So it was her.



The woman who risked her life to win was Isabella.


Isabella pushed him,refusing to admit it. "Michael, what are you talking about? I was home alone. I don't have so many
'engagements' in the middle of the night like you!"



He reeked of Bianca's sickly sweet perfume.



It made her nauseous.



Thinking about Daniel's improving condition, Isabella smirked.
"Since you and Bianca are inseparable, I won't take up space.I've had the divorce papers redrafted. See you in court the day after tomorrow."



Michael thought he could bully her because she had no one to back her up.
Using a lousy agreement to keep her, flirting with Bianca right in front of her, she had it enough.



Michael's face darkened like the night. "Say it again, you want a divorce?"



"Yes,every second with you makes me feel awful. This marriage,I'm definitely ending it." With that, Isabella got in her car and left without hesitation.



Leaving Michael standing there, seething with anger.



The car disappeared in a flash, and the emotions in Michael's eyes threatened to consume everything.



Early the next morning, Aiden called. Michael had just lain down for a bit, and the call filled him with irritation. "Grandpa, what's so urgent this early?"


Aiden got angry, "Early? Do you even know what time it is? Tell me,where's Isabella? Have you been trying to win her back these past few days? Isabella is just acting tough. Say some nice things,
and she'll listen. You're just too emotionally unintelligent, which is why things have come to this."



On the other end, Aiden patiently instructed Michael on how to win Isabella back.



"Grandpa, maybe there really is a problem between us. Perhaps we both need some time apart." Michael's voice was low, his mood matching.



Aiden scolded him directly, "Do you think this is a business negotiation? You're a married couple. Arguments are nothing to fear.Right now, you need to ask for Isabella's forgiveness. If you wait for her to calm down, you'll be out of the picture. You're in your twenties, and I still have to teach you how to handle a relationship. What have you been doing these past few days?"



"Grandpa, I've tried everything. She won't comne back." Michael felt helpless.



"Bullshit. I know what you're capable of. I'm telling you, if Isabella doesn't come home, I won't acknowledge you as my grandson!"Aiden hung up in anger.
Michael stared at his phone, wide awake, his face dark.


He thought. 'She said divorce, and that's it? Hell no'



He didn't control the start of this marriage, and he wouldn't let her end it on a whim!



As Michael was racking his brain on how to deal with the divorce papers Isabella sent, his subordinate Aaron called to report an issue with an overseas project.



The project manager couldn't handle it and had to report it to the headquarters.



Michael's eyes flashed. "Book a flight to Novaterra for today."



His tone wasn't annoyed but rather pleased.


Aaron was stunned.
###Chapter 43 The Rise of Public Opinion


Isabella woke up naturally, only to find dozens of missed calls and messages on her phone.



She rubbed her eyes, thinking she must be seeing things.



There were calls from Olivia, Thomas, and even her eldest uncle,Atticus Wilson, who hadn't returned to the country in years.



Before she could decide which call to return, her subordinate Jesse called her on a video call. "Ms. Taylor, something bad has happened."



"What is it?" Isabella asked.



Jesse was in a panic, "Last night, the incident where you argued with the Taylor Family at the hospital was posted online, and it was live-streamed. Now, news about you is everywhere on the internet.You mustn't go out these days."
Isabella didn't think much of it. She knew Bianca had live-streamed it.



She didn't think she was in the wrong. "She's the one who ruined my family. Why should I hide?"



"Public opinion doesn't care about that. People will just follow the trend, and that's how rumors start." Jesse was extremely nervous, "If it really gets out of hand, I can have the company's PR department suppress it for a few days until the heat dies down."



"No need to involve the company. Since it's already out there,let the public opinion ferment for a while." Isabella said calmly.



She didn't need to think to know that Bianca had deliberately posted the live stream online.



Since Bianca liked to post her business online, Isabella would help her out and make her go viral.



Jesse was on the verge of a breakdown, but Isabella wasn't worried at all.
He couldn't understand why Isabella, who could easily get rid of the Taylor Family with a word, insisted on keeping them around to oppose her.



Before Jesse could speak, Atticus's call came in.


"Atticus, aren't you currently on a confidential mission? Thomas and I didn't dare disturb you. How come you suddenly have time to call me?" Isabella said playfully.



Atticus had joined the military at a young age and was later recruited into a special unit.



Not only was he rarely seen, but he also couldn't talk about where he went or what he did.



He had dedicated everything to the country and had no plans to marry or have children.



Besides feeling guilty towards Daniel, he only cared deeply for Isabella.
When Isabella was brought back to the Wilson Family, she was still young. Over the years, Atticus had treated her like his own child.



If anything happened to Isabella, he would be heartbroken.



He said, "I see you're causing trouble again while I'm away. What's going on with the stuff online? Who did it?"



Atticus was very good to his family.



If someone dared to bully Isabella, there was no way he would ignore it.



"It's nothing, Atticus. Those are just rumors. Don't worry about it."Anyone falsely accused like that wouldn't ignore it. Isabella wasn't pretending not to see; she had more important things to do.



She would endure for now and take revenge when the time was right.



Atticus said, "Nonsense! How can you ignore this? The company
wants to intervene, why are you stopping them?"


Chris had already called Isabela for instructions the first time the incident occurred, which was last night before she went to sleep.



"Atticus, I finally get a call from you, and all you do is scold me?Don't forget I'm married and an adult now."



Hearing Isabella say this, Atticus softened his tone, "I know you always have a plan. I'm not around, and I don't want you to get hurt. Daniel is sick now; you can't afford to get into trouble."



"Oh, stop worrying about me. I'm fine, and so is Grandpa.Focus on your mission. It would be great if you could bring back a girlfriend." Isabella lightened the mood and ended the call after a few more words with Atticus.



She then returned calls to everyone she knew who had called her.


She told them she was fine and not to worry about her.
The whole process took her nearly an hour, leaving her exhausted.


Logically, she was the one being talked about online and should be the one comforted, but in the end, she had to comfort everyone else.



Finally, her phone quieted down. Isabella opened her long-unused Facebook and saw over a million unread messages.



She couldn't help but widen her eyes.


How did these netizens even find this?



Most of the private messages were telling her to apologize to Bianca in person, with many cursing and condemning her.


She skimmed through them, seeing some people praising her for being sexy, beautiful, and having a great figure, and she liked those comments.



She replied: [Good taste.]
Indeed, there were still sharp-eyed people among the crowd.


There were also many posts about her.



Isabella was impressed by these netizens, who even dug up her childhood stories.



They found out that her mother, Grace, died when she was seven,that she was withdrawn at school, fought with other kids, and even stole fruit from the school's back hill.



She remembered that after Grace died, Indigo brought Harper and Bianca back home.



Then her status dropped.



She fought with other kids because they spoke ill of Grace,and she stole fruit because Harper wouldn't give her any. Even the snacks the servant secretly gave her were taken by Bianca.



She was hungry for so long that she had to find food herself.
Thinking of this, Isabella's lips curled into a cold smile.


She would make that mother and daughter pay for what they did to her.



At this time, Bianca was still complaining online, talking about how Isabella had oppressed anad bullied her over the years, and even brought up that she knew Michael first.



She implied that it wasn't her who ruined Isabella and Michael's relationship, but that Isabella had forcefully taken her place.



Bianca ended by asking netizens not to bully Isabella too much,saying that as Isabella's sister, she still valued their family bond and wanted to give Isabella another chance.



She pushed all the blame onto Isabella.



A bunch of netizens followed suit, feeling sorry for Bianca's magnanimity and grievances.
They demanded she apologize to Bianca.


Isabella almost felt sick reading it.



She directly posted on Facebook.


[I am Isabella. My mom only gave birth to me. I don't have any sisters. If you have a problem, come at me. I'll take it. But if you want an apology, maybe in the next life. Also, have you packed up the Taylor Family's stuff? I'm coming tocollect the house tomorrow.Don't think you can leave any trash behind.]



Isabella's words were harsh and direct, immediately sparking another wave of comments online.



[Oh my God1, she's so cool. I love her. I support Isabella.]



[This is a twisted. Bianca stole Isabella's boyfriend and now acts all righteous. Does she have any morals?]



[Isabella bullies Bianca because she's easygoing, huh? Watch me
expose her identity online and avenge Bianca.]



The online comments kept coming. but Isabella couldn't be bothered to read them in detail.



These rumors couldn't hurt her.
###Chapter 44 Michael Disappeared

The next day.

Today was the day she and Michael had agreed to go to court.


To her surprise, he hadn't protested or hired a lawyer in the past two days.

Isabella stood in front of the full-length mirror in a striking red cocktail dress, paired with a limited-edition handbag of the same color,looking radiant and bold.


This was the real Isabella.

Miss of the Wilson Family from east Valoria.

The woman who had once married into the Brown Family with high hopes had lost all her vitality over the past three years due to this marriage.

Starting today, she would be herself again.

The netizens were indeed powerful; it had only been two days since the issue started to ferment, and many things about Isabella had already been dug up.

They only knew that her marriage was a secret.

Later, when they heard she was getting divorced, everyone seemed to seize the opportunity to see her in person.

Even outside the courthouse, there were quite a few people waiting.


Some were there just to watch the drama, eager to see if Isabella was as stunning in person as she was in photos.
Another group consisted of media reporters, looking to exploit the couple's fame for profit.

The most fervent. of course, were Bianca's fans, who were eager to get back at Isabella.


But all of this was within the Wilson Family's expectations.

Jesse had arranged for people to protect Isabella early on.

Even before she arrived, the courthouse was already crowded, and the staff inside were geting headaches trying to manage the situation.

People outside were sitting on the steps, starting to gossip.


[Did you know? That vicious sister of Bianca, Isabella,married an old and ugly nouveau riche. I heard she couldn't have a child in three years, so she stripped down to seduce Bianca's boyfriend, and got caught, which is why she's getting divorced.]

[Is that true?]


[Of course it is. Didn't you see Bianca's livestream? A super handsome guy came in at the enad. His physique is better than a top model's. That's Bianca's boyfriend, Michael.]


[Isabella, as an older sister, is really shameless, trying to steal Bianca's boyfriend.But luckily, Mr. Brown doesn't like her. If he did, my heart would break.]

[No way, Mr. Brown is going to marry Bianca. They are the perfect match.]


[That's good, then we men still have a chance. No matter how vicious Isabella is, at least she has a great body!l
IYou guys really are desperate. Isabella doesn't have just one affair.Someone even saw her hugging and kissing an old man who could be her grandfather.l

[Really? That's disgusting.I

The crowd kept providing new "evidence." as if just saying it made it a fact about Isabella.


The women sneered. while the men were even more interested in Isabella.

It seemed that only by doing this could they feel on the same level as a sexy beauty like Isabella, without feeling inferior.

As the group was getting more excited, two Bentleys drove up,followed by a limited-edition Rolls-Royce.

They slowly stopped at the courthouse entrance.

Everyone was stunned.

They had only seen such a scene in TV dramas.

Several men in black got out of the front cars, blocking people from approaching. standing with their hands behind their backs.guarding the person getting out of the car behind them.

Isabella stepped out, her red dress making her even more dazzling in the sunlight.

With her exquisite makeup and long hair cascading over her shoulders,many people were left speechless.

"No way, she's the vicious sister Isabella who cursed Bianca in the livestream? My God, she's a hundred times more beautiful in person than
on the phone!" Someone whispered.

Hearing this, Bianca's fans immediately got upset, sarcastically saying,"So what if Isabella is beautiful? She used her looks to seduce Bianca's boyfriend. Isn't she here to get divorced? That car must belong to that old man."


Everyone waited for the person behind to appear, eager to see who this old man was.

Instead, a handsome man in an iron-gray suit. Thomas, stepped out.With gold-rimmed glasses and a glance. he exuded an indescribable charm.

He gently held Isabella's hand, and the two looked like a couple.

But Isabella called him "Uncle Thomas."

The crowd waiting to see Isabella's embarrassment fell silent.

After they walked in, someone whispered. "Wasn't Isabella's boyfriend supposed to be old and ugly? He's clearly a top-tier hunk!"

"Don't be hasty. Maybe the old man hasn't arrived yet?"

Bianca's fans refused to admit they were making things up.

"Wasn't someone going to force Isabella to apologize to Bianca? Why is it so quiet now?" someone mocked.

No one dared to do that.

Those bodyguards looked formidable, not the usual kind. If anyone stepped forward, they might be pinned down immediately.

These people were paid to do their job and wouldn't listen to reason.
Isabella waited in the hall for two hours, and people gossiped about her the entire time.


Michael never showed up.

As noon approached and the staff were about to go off duty. Isabella finally called Michael for the first time.

No answer!

She called again,same result.

Finally.his phone was turned off.

Isabella never expected Michael to disappear at this critical moment.making her so angry she wanted to drag him out herself.

Just before the staff were about to leave, a daring reporter handed a microphone to Thomas, who was sitting nearby.

Feeling both nervous and excited, he asked. "Hello, what is your relationship with Isabella? Do you know she stole her sister Bianca's boyfriend? Also, do you know why her husband Michael didn't show up for the divorce?"


"Mr. Reporter, you can mislead me into giving you the answer you want.but I can also sue you for defaming my client." Thomas's voice remained calm throughout. "My name is Thomas, and I am the chief attorney for Isabella's divorce case."


He glanced at the reporter, seemingly calm but with an underlying menace.

Thomas's name caused a stir among the crowd.

The man frequently featured on financial news, Thomas.
He owned the most famous financial company and had a legendary legal team that had never lost a case.


It was said that any case he handled never lost.

So when he said he was the chief attorney for Isabella's divorce case.did he mean he was going to use that legendary legal team for a simple divorce?


With Thomas's statuas and class, who would dare to mess with him?

In just a few seconds. the reporter was drenched in cold sweat. As he was about to retract the microphone and leave in a hurry,

Thomas grabbed the microphone and confronted Michael through the camera. "Mr. Brown, if you refuse to follow the usual procedures, we will have to take legal action. No matter where you are, the legal notice will be in your inbox tonight. I'll be waiting for you in Evergreen City!"
###Chapter 45 A Complete Reversal

After Thomas finished speaking, he raised an eyebrow at the reporter."You don't need me to tell you what to do next. right?"

The reporter nodded repeatedly.not daring to show any disrespect.

Thomas was a man with an undefeated team of lawyers at his disposal.

"Mr. Wilson, is this Michael you're referring to the president of the Brown Group in Evergreen City. Mr. Brown?" A bold member of the media approached and asked in a low voice.

The name Michael sounded familiar, but when associated with a divorce case.it inevitably drew attention.

"That's right!" Thomas responded decisively.

How...how could this be?

The reporters below were stunned, "So, Michael is..."

"Michael is my husband. I'm here today to divorce him. Does anyone know where he is?" Isabella said.


The reporters were too shocked to speak.

The news was too overwhelming for them to process immediately.

But someone still honestly shook their head, "We don't know Mr. Brown's whereabouts."


Isabella spoke to the camera, "Michael, get over here and divorce me. Don't think hiding will solve anything. My patience is limited. If you don't divorce me, be prepared to split half of your assets with me."
Everyone was stunned.

Online rumors had suggested that Bianca was Michael's lover and that Isabella, as the older sister, had seduced Michael.

But now, Isabella's husband was Michael.

So the real person who had ruined Isabella and Michael's relationship was Bianca!

The one playing the bad guy in the middle was Michael.

This was too shocking!

Almost everyone present had more or less cursed Isabella for seducing Bianca's boyfriend, because they believed in Bianca's side of the story.

But they hadn't expected the truth to be a complete reversal.

Whether or not Isabella had been with an older man for money.the fact that Bianca liked her sister Isabella's husband Michael and had deliberately slandered Isabella was now certain.

Bianca's perfect image was thus destroyed.

"Thomas, let's go." Isabella said.

With the spread of this news by the reporters, she didn't believe Michael could stay calm.


They said she ruined Bianca and Michael's relationship,so she would let everyone see who the real intruder was.


Since Michael wouldn't show up today, Isabella wouldn't waste any more time.
She and Thomas got into the car and left.

After Isabella left, many reporters followed her from a distance.

Because someone had just mentioned that Isabella hadI said yesterday she would kick the Taylor family out like trash today.


With Isabella's terrifying decisiveness. there was bound to be another big drama today.

Isabella was going to kick Indigo and Harper's family out of the house.

Those who heard this were naturally curious and wouldn't question who was so "smart" to bring it up at this time.

About forty minutes later.

The car arrived at the gate of a beautifully landscaped villa.

The house was in a prime location. not far from downtown, with a nearby wetland garden, making it a quiet place amidst the hustle and bustle.


Grace had loved this location so much that she sold her jewelry to buy it.

At the time. Daniel had been completely against Grace marrying Indigo.

After Grace got pregnant out of wedlock. Daniel cut off all financial support, and for the years Grace raised her child, she had been using her money to support Indigo.

Grace had thought her efforts would be rewarded. but in reality,her endless giving onlyled to more demands from Indigo.

Looking back, she really felt it wasn't worth it for Grace.
Indigo might never have liked Grace; he loved the power and wealth behind her.


Seeing a row of men in black standing outside. Indigo and Harper were too scared to open the door.

Isabella was not polite and signaled her people to take action.

The bodyguards were about to rush in.

Harper.seeing this from the second floor, shouted down in fear, "Isabella.you bitch. what do you think you're doing? This is my house. If you dare touch anything. I'll call the police and have you arrested for trespassing.
You'll spend the rest of your life in jail!"

"Then go ahead!" Isabella said lightly. "Let's see who ends up in jail."

Grace had been ill but not completely unaware. This house had been in her name long before Harper and her mother arrived.

She had tolerated Indigo's behavior because he had been honest, but now that they were bullying her and trying to give benefits to Bianca,she wouldn't tolerate this disgusting family for another minute.

"I'll give you half an hour to pack your things and get out, or I'll throw you and your dirty belongings out together."


The black-clad bodyguards behind Isabella spread out in the yard.exuding a strong presence.


Indigo wanted to curse but, seeing those people, felt a chill in his heart and lost his nerve. "Isabella, I'm your biological father.People will call you unfilial if you kick me out. If you really dare to do this, I'll sever our relationship today"
Indigo's words no longer had any effect on Isabella. She said calmly."Then let's sever it. It's useless to keep it!"

"You!" Indigo was stunned, seeing Isabella's cold expression,and didn't know what to say.

He slammed the door shut.

What a joke. He had lived here for half his life. This was his place. Who dared to make him move if he didn't agree?

When the time was up.

Isabella ordered her people to throw out everyone and everything that belonged to them.


Indigo was so scared he called the police.

Harper called Bianca, asking her to get Michael to come and save them.

But by this time, Michael had already landed in Novaterra, dealing with company projects and thinking about how to get Isabella to drop the divorce.


Aaron had immediately brought the domestic news to Michael.

At the same time, Michael saw Thomas's provocative words on camera,his face darkening.

Unable to reach Michael by phone, Bianca couldn't keep up the act.

She hurriedly left the hospital and went home.

Afraid that if she delayed any longer, she wouldn't even have a place to stay.
The whole building was surrounded. Bianca got out of the car just as the police arrived in response to Indigo's call. She gave her name and followed them inside.

There were so many people that it took her ten minutes to walk a short distance to her house.


Her hair was messy, and she had been touched by people claiming to be her fans. She finally made it into the yard. only to see Isabella leisurely sitting on a swing, playing with her phone.

Next to her. Thomas was peeling fruit for her.

Each had a black-clad bodyguard holding an umbrella to shield them from the sun. Isabella only had to open her mouth to eat whatever she wanted.

Isabella looked every bit the part of a mafia boss.
###Chapter 46 Get Out of My Mom's House

Seeing Bianca and the police arrive. Indigo and Harper exchanged glances.feeling a surge of confidence.

They hurriedly opened the door and started arguing with Isabella.

"Officer, you're here just in time. It's her, Isabella. She hasn't come back for years, and now she wants to kick our whole family out and take over my property. Arrest her quickly." Indigo's voice grew louder as he spoke.

The police officer looked around. Not only was the place crowded with onlookers. but there was also a group of reporters with cameras.

He couldn't juast listen to Indigo's side of the story.

Among everyone in the courtyard, the only one who seemed composed was Thomas. the man with gold-rimmed glasses standing next to Isabella.

"Can you explain what happened?" The police captain walked over and asked Thomas.


"Hello, officer. I'm Thomas,the head of Global Financial Solutions and the legal representative for Isabella. You can direct any questions to me."Thomas said.


The captain was taken aback. "You're the head of Global Financial Solutions, so you must know Ryan?"

Thomas smirked. "Ryan is an employee of my company."

The implication was clear.

The captain immediately understood and hurried over to shake hands and
exchange pleasantries.

It was no small matter; Ryan had recently taken on a major international criminal case involving a notorious drug lord. Everyone thought the man would be extradited, but Ryan used his expertise in international law to ensure he was sentenced domestically.

The defendant had cried in court.

Ryan's reputation had skyrocketed, and many wanted to hire him, but he only worked for Global Financial Solutions.

Which meant he worked for Thomas's financial company.

Meeting Ryan's boss, the police captain couldn't help but be excited.

Thomas took the opportunity to explain the situation clearly,but Indigo felt something was off.

Harper, feeling she had no chance. pulled Bianca aside to ask."Where's Michae1? Why isn't he here yet? Didn't you call him?"

In Harper's eyes, Michael was destined to marry Bianca.

With the Taylor family in trouble, they naturally turned to him for help.

Bianca was anxious too, but she didn't dare show it in front of Isabella.
She lowered her voice, "How would I know? I haven't been able to reach
Michael since last night. Even today, he hasn't answered any of my calls."

Harper's face darkened. "What do we do? If he doesn't come, we can't do anything about Isabella!"

The captain had already investigated the matter.
It tumned out Indigo had been occupying Grace's property.

Isabella presented the property documents with her name on them.irrefutable evidence.


The police only recognized the evidence. After explaining the situation.they ordered Indigo's family to move out immediately.

Even the onlookers fell silent.

The house was Grace's inheritance for Isabella, but Indigo and Harper's family had taken it over.

Hearing they had to leave. Harper lost it.

She sat on the ground. wailing and cursing. "This is my place. I'm not leaving. If you want me out, you'll have to step over my dead body.You call yourselves police? You're just in cahoots with Isabella."

Indigo's face darkened. and he quickly pulled Harper aside. "What are you doing? Bianca is a big star now. How can she continue her career with you causing a scene like this?"

Bianca felt embarrassed too.

Her public image was that of a noble and elegant piano prodigy. With reporters outside andHarper's disgraceful behavior, how could she maintain her standing in the entertainment industry?

With so many people watching,she couldn't lose her composure.

She could only direct her anger at Isabella. "Isabella, do you really want to see our family driven to despair? Mom and Dad loved you the most.I even gave up Michael for you, and now you treat us like enemies,leaving
us with nowhere to go. How heartless!"

Tears streamed down Bianca's face as she spoke.

Hearing this, people couldn't help but gossip.

"So Michael was originally Isabella's husband, and Bianca gave him up for her. No wonder Isabella got divorced. She's so ungrateful. now she's even harming Bianca!"

"Isabella is just an ungrateful bitch!"

Someone outside shouted at Isabella.

Isabella's cold gaze silenced them immediately.

It was obvious Bianca's "fans" were causing trouble.

She slowly stood up. her high heels clicking as she approached Harper and Bianca.

She sneered. "I have to say, sometimes I really admire your ability to lie so confidently. My marriage to Michael was arranged by my grandfather and Aiden twenty years ago. Did you need to give him up for me?"

There was an uproar outside.

As always, Isabella's rebuttals were sharp and powerful.

Rumors had it that Bianca came from a wealthy family,had a rich and influential boyfriend,Michael, and was a piano prodigy. The truth was far from it.

Bianca's face turned pale.
Isabella continued, "Should I add that your mother. Harper, seduced Indigo while my mother was sick, worsening her condition? Why don't you mention that online? You and your mother are homewreckers!"

The onlookers were stunned.

They knew they had followed the right drama.

Seeing Isabella, whom she had bullied since childhood. now standing up to her. Bianca's eyes filled with hatred. "How dare you call my mom that?Show me the evidence. or stop slandering us."

"Evidence?" Isabella laughed. "When my mom died in the hospital.you were already six months in Harper's womb. So. you are the best evidence of Harper being Indigo's mistress!"

"I'm not! Shut up!" Bianca couldn't hold back any longer, her face twisted in anger."Isabella, aren't you afraid Michael will get back at you?"

Isabella looked at her like she was an idiot. "'m divorcing him.Why would I care about him? Officer, please remove them from my home. I'm tired and don't want to see them here."


Isabella couldn't be bothered to argue with themanymore.

Under police supervision, Indigo's family had no choice but to pack up and leavee.


The remaining items were thrown onto the street by a dozen bodyguards.

With the matter settled, the onlookers and reporters were cleared out.

In the now-empty courtyard, only Isabella and Thomas remained.

Thomas put his arm around her shoulder, looking at the house with her.
Having lost his only sister Grace when he was young,he wouldn't let Isabella suffer any more injustice.
###Chapter 47 Asking Michael for Help

Harper.who had just left the house, was still cursing loudly. Bianca, sitting nearby, couldn't hold back any longer. "Shut up! Do you think I haven't been embarrassed enough today?"

Harper's face stiffened, but she eventually closed her mouth.

She felt both proud and fearful of her daughter, Bianca.

After all, she was counting on Bianca for her future wealth and status.

Bianca's eyes were filled with disdain and irritation.

She couldn't understand what Indigo saw in Harper; even she couldn't stand Harper's shrewish behavior.

There were quite a few reporters and media present today.

The image she had been maintaining online these past few days was probably ruined.


Among the three of them. Indigo was the calmest. "Bianca, why don't you call Michael's assistant. Aaron, and ask what's going on? Just because Michael isn't answering doesn't mean Aaron won't."


"That's right. Michael has always cared about you the most. He wouldn't just ignore you. Hurry up and call him." Harper urged,finally catching on.

Bianca collected herself and called Aaron. who connected her to Michael.

Before Michael could even speak, Bianca started crying, causing Michael to frown deeply on the other end.

Bianca's tendency to cry at the drop of a hat was really annoying.
"Michael. Isabella kicked me and my parents out of the house today and called us homewreckers in front of everyone. We have nowhere to go now."Bianca sobbed as she spoke. "Isabella is trying to push us to the brink.Can you help me?"

"I'm not in the country. Let Aaron handle this for you. That's it.I'm hanging up." Michael said before ending the call.

He didn't even offer a word of comfort. leaving Bianca feeling disappointed.

But she believed Michael still cared about her; otherwise,he wouldn't have let her and her family stay in his house.

Soon.Bianca received a location message from Aaron.

It was one of Michael's vacant apartments.

She gripped her phone tightly, silently vowing.

Once she became the mistress of the Brown Family, the first person she would seek revenge on would be Isabella.

She would make Isabella pay back today's humiliation a hundredfold.

Abroad. Michael sat in a chair, pressing his stomach with a pained expression.

He had been busy handling company affairs and traveling long distances.which had triggered his gastritis.

There were also endless troubles back home.

He had watched all the videos Aaron had brought him. Isabella's boldness had taken him by surprise.
Not only had she made their divorce public, but she had also kicked Indigo's family out.

Despite knowing Michael didn't like her being with Thomas, she had stood by his side. affectionately holding his arm outside the courthouse.


She had even called out to the media with Thomas,announcing their intention to divorce Michael.

Thinking of her bright and flamboyant face on camera. Michael couldn't
help but let out a bitter smile.

When Isabella decided to be ruthless, she really didn't leave him any dignity.


"Mr. Brown. there's a group of reporters outside wanting to interview you about the divorce." Aaron said. entering with a panicked expression.

Michael sat up straight, his face displeased. "Tell them I'm not accepting any interviews. Have security kick them out. If they don't listen. call the police!"

As Aaron left, a call from Aiden back home came in.

"What did I tell you? Didn't I ask you to speak nicely to Isabella? How did it end up in court?" Aiden's voice was full of vigor. and he could have scolded Michael for half an hour without getting tired.

On the other hand. Michael was already breaking out in a cold sweat.

"Grandpa. I've done everything I could." Michael said, his voice much lower.

"I think you just don't want to be with Isabella. You're still thinking about
Bianca. Let me tell you, the Brown Family will never accept a woman like Bianca. You better give up on her."

"Grandpa, I didn't..."

Before Michael could finish, Aiden had already hung up in anger.

When Aaron came back in, he saw Michael pale and slumped in his chair.clutching his stomach, looking terrified. "Mr. Brown, are you okay? I'llcall an ambulance right now!"

Michael's condition was so alarming that Aaron, holding his phone, was about to make the call when Michael stopped him. "I'm not going to the hospital. Things here are almost settled. Book a flight back home for tomorrow morning."

Perhaps it was because he had spent so much time with Isabella recently.

He started to recall the times he had been cold to her.

He finally know how it felt like to want to hold onto someone but was repeatedly rejected.

That night. Isabella slept in Grace's house.

The place no longer had any traces of Indigo's family, only the original look of the house remained.

Over the years, Grace's memories had gradually faded from her mind.She had to look at photos of her younger self often to remember her clearly.

She was afraid of forgetting Grace.

Sleeping in the familiar bedroom, surrounded by familiar surroundings.distant memories seemed to become clearer.
It made her feel closer to Grace.

Early the next morning, her subordinate Jesse arrived at Isabella's new residence.


He had prepared the documents and clothes she needed for work.

Walking into the house. Jesse looked around curiously at the decor, quite surprised.

Isabella had restored it to how it looked like when she was little, with no extra decorations or luxurious style, just a simple set of wooden furniture.reflecting the house's original design concept.

It was warm and unique.

"What are you looking at?" Isabella asked as she came down the stairs.dressed in a white business suit.

Jesse looked up and smiled. "It seems like there are traces of Ms. Wilson's childhood here. It gives a warm and comfortable feeling. Such a nice house.it's a shame it was wasted on the Taylor Family."

"Don't worry, their punishment is far from over," Isabella said, her eyes narrowing. Indigo's family owed her and Grace,and she would make sure to collect it all.

The education and medical base project proposed by the Wilson Family last time had been progressing smoothly.


Not only did they have the $950 million Michael had invested at the banquet, but they also had the strong support of two major companies.


The Wilson Group had made a spectacular comeback in front of everyone.
After this, the shareholders of the Wilson Group no longer dared to oppose Isabella.


After all. Isabella truly had the capability.

Moreover, Isabella didn't spare any face for these old shareholders.


If they had valid points, it was fine. But if they tried to cause trouble based on their status, they would only embarrass themselves.


In the large conference room.

"Ms. Taylor, the developer of the Crystal Cove water resort is unable to repay their debts and is now offering to sell the entire resort at a low price.Should we take this opportunity to acquire it?"


Today's meeting was specifically called to discuss this matter.

The person in charge of Crystal Cove had already fled overseas,leaving behind a mess.
###Chapter 48 The Taste of Being Beaten

Crystal Cove was not small in scale, andits location was fairly decent,but the point was that there were too many problematic accounts.

Once taken over, just handling the various processes would waste a lot of time.


It was time-consuming. labor-intensive, and costly, plus the risk was great,so few companies in Evergreen City dared to take it on completely.

But Crystal Cove WAs located in the central part of Evergreen City.

The Wilson Family was not interested in the resort but in the land of Crystal Cove.


If the Wilson Family acquired this land, they could establish a firm foothold in Evergreen City.


Unfortunately,the Brown Group was also interested in this land.


They had already negotiated with the person in charge of the Crystal Cove project several times before the Wilson Family.


"Michael is also interested in Crystal Cove?" Isabella tapped her fingers on the table.


Although the Crystal Cove project indeed had risks, if Michael was involved, it meant this land was definitely not ordinary. Or, he wanted to use this to prevent the Wilson Group from advancing into the southern part of Valoria.


No matter what, the more he didn't want the Wilson Group to succeed, the more she wanted to prove herself.
She said, "Find someone to investigate the underlying issues of the Crystal Cove land, and also, find out the bottom price offered by the Brown Group.By any means necessary, acquire this land before the Brown Group."


With Thomas's legal team, she didn't need to worry about what was coming after.


Everything would be resolved.


Isabella had an idea in her mind, and when she gave the order,she exuded a powerful and convincing aura.


Her confidence came not only from her own judgment but also from her several omnipotent uncles.


She had just walked out of the conference room.

Isabella saw several missed calls from Aiden on her phone.

She felt a bit guilty.

Aiden was getting old and not in good health. The big fuss over her divorce from Michael would definitely make Aiden very sad.


Isabella thought about it and decided to buy some things and visit Aiden in the evening.


Aiden had always been kind to her, and she couldn't ignore that.

As for the others, she would just pretend not to see them.


In the evening, Isabella stood outside the gate of the Brown Villa with a fruit gift box. Her raised hand slowly fell back down.

A few days ago, she had been so decisive in front of the reporters.
But when it came to facing Michael, her aura disappeared instantly.

Michael had always opposed her.


"Mrs. Brown! Come in quickly!" Sophia Thompson, who was carrying groceries.saw Isabella and her eyes lit up.


In the three years since Isabella married into the family, she had never shown the bad temper rumored outside and was never harsh to the servants. She was also very filiaI to Aiden.


Even when Stella deliberately ordered her around every day, she never complained and never asked the servants for help.


She always did things quietly by herself.


In the enad. it was Michael who was too much. Not only did he not come home often, but he also entangled with Bianca outside, angering Isabella.


Anyone would find it hard to endure.

"Sophia, is Michael home?" Isabella asked softly.


Seeing the nervousness on Isabella's face, Sophia patted her, "Don't worry,Mr. Michael Brown is not home. It seems something happened at the company, and Mr. Michael Brown hasn't been back for a long time. Mrs.Brown, you came back this time to visit Mr. Aiden Brown,right?"

Isabella nodded.

Sophia smiled and led Isabella inside.


As they walked, they talked about Aiden's recent condition. "Let's go in quickly. Mr. Aiden Brown has been thinking about you these past few days. I heard that you are officialy filing for divorce from Mr. Michael
Brown, and he has been so worried that he can't eat. The doctor just came by this morning."

Stella was sitting in the hall, fiddling with her freshly done nails, when she saw Isabella following Sophia inside.

Her face immediately turned displeased. "Sophia, how can you bring anyone in as you please!"

Sophia, who was responsible for Aiden's meals, was not under Stella's authority and naturally wasn't afraid of her. "Mrs. Stella Brown, what do you mean by that? She hasn't divorced Mr. Brown yet. This house is still open to her whenever she wants to come in. Besides. Mr. Brown wants to see her the most right now. If you upset Mr. Brown. I wonder if you can bear the responsibility. Mrs. Stella Brown."

Stella was furious, but her momentum dropped immediately when it came to Aiden.


Everyone knew that Aiden was so worried about their divorce that his heart couldn't take it. and the doctor had been called.

Sophia turned to Isabella and said, "Mr. Brown is resting in his room. You can go straight there. If anyone dares to stop you, Mr. Brown won't let them off."

"Sophia, don't think you can shout at me just because Mr. Brown supports you!" Stella was livid, pointing at Sophia with a red face. "No matter what,you're just a servant. I'm the mistress of this house. What right do you have to defy me?"

But Sophia didn't respond to her at all and went into the kitchen with her things.
Stella's anger then focused entirely on Isabella. "I thought it was someone else. Weren't you quite tough when you walked out of this house?Why you're back so soon, lowering yourself?"

The news of Isabella calling for a divorce from Michael had spread like wildfire online.


Seeing her now made Stella even angrier. "Michael doesn't want you. and now you dare to smear the Brown Family online? A bumpkin like you isn't even worthy of being Michael's wife!"

Stella's actions didn't mean much to Isabella.

She didn't have the energy to waste time with her.

In a calm tone. she said. "Have you finished? If so. I'm leaving."


Stella was so angry that her fingertips were trembling.

Seeing Isabella walking towards the backyard without a care,Stella was burning with rage and raised her hand to hit her. "How dare you come here? There's no place for you here. Get out1”


Before her hand could touch Isabella, Isabella grabbed Stella's wrist.


Stella's eyes widened, and she tried to pull back, but Isabella's grip was so strong that it changed her expression in pain.


"I don't wvant to waste time on someone like you. If you want to get physical. I don't mind showing you what a real beating feels like!" With that. Isabella released her, and Stella staggered back, almost falling.

"You...you uncultured woman, you're a lunatic!" Unable to win physically.Stella resorted to cursing Isabella.
Isabella gave her a cold look, and Stella immediately shrank back. With no one else in the hall, if Isabella started a fight, she would really be left with nothing but a beating.

"Just you wait. When Michael comes back, I'll make sure you pay for this!"Stella clutched her wrist and quickly ran upstairs.


Isabella turned and went to the backyard. For the past three years,Stella had always looked down on her, and on the day she filed for divorce,Stella had even invited Bianca and her mother over as guests.


She had long stopped seeing Stella as an elder.

So she wouldn't show Stella any kindness anymore.
###Chapter 49 Michael is Back

Aiden was truly ill.


When Isabella walked in. Aiden was lying weakly on the bed, with an IV drip attached to his hand.


Isabella felt even more guilty.

It was all because of her that Aiden was so affected and fell ill.

"Aiden. I'm back to see you." Isabella placed the fruit aside and walked up with a smile. "I specially bought your favorite fruits. You can eat some when you're free. but not too much. or your blood sugar will rise."

Isabella nagged Aiden as she usually did.

Aiden, however. enjoyed it and patted her hand, "I know, Isabella has always been a sensible and obedient child. It's Michael's fault for not being able to keep you."


Isabella lowered her head, not daring to look into Aiden's eyes,feeling inevitably guilty. "I'm sorry. It's my fault for spreading the news. If you want to blame someone, blame me."


Aiden shook his head and sighed, "How can I blame you? If anyone is to blame, it's Michael for not taking responsibility. He promised to treat you well for a lifetime when he married you. It's my fault for not educating him well and making you bear so much. Isabella. I've never blamed you.I just hope you can come to see me often."


Isabella felta pang in her heart. "Don't worry. Whether Michael and I divorce or not, I've always considered you my family. I'll come to see you whenever I have timne,okay?"
"Good. I've been waiting for those words." Aiden happily sat up,but couldn't help coughing a few times.


"Have some water." Isabella brought over a cup of water.


"I'm old. I don't know how many more years I have left." Aiden said slowly.


"No, you're healthy and won't get old." Isabella comforted him.

"You always know what to say." Aiden's face showed more smiles,but also more reluctance towards Isabella. "Isabella, now that you're back,when do you plan to leave? Can you stay a few more days to keep me company? The house is always empty, and there's no one to talk to."


Isabella couldn't bear to refuse Aiden at this moment. She thought that since Michael wasn't home. she could wait until Aiden felt better before leaving.


Now Aiden's health was poor and ate much less.

Isabella personally made some porridge, and Aiden bearly ate some.

Isabella promised not to leave tonight, and Aiden slept peacefully.

It was already night, and Isabella returned to her previous bedroom.

She took a shower and went to sleep.


Michael arrived home late at night after his flight, feeling weak due to his stomach issues. He pushed open the door and collapsed onto the bed.


A familiar scent filled his nose.

It was unique to Isabella.
Impossible!

How could she be here?


Michael chuckled bitterly. He thought he must be so tired that he was having hallucinations


He unconsciously turned over, facing a small sleeping face.

In the moonlight. Isabella's delicate features were clearly visible. Michael's hand couldn't help but reach out.


So soft,so real.

It really was her!


Isabella was awakened by the pain. In the middle of the night.someone was pinching her face and touching her.


She opened her eyes to see a large shadow in front of her. Isabella quickly sat up and turned on the bedside lamp.


"Michael! What are you doing here!" Isabella blurted out in shock.

Michael found her reaction amusing. "Shouldn't I be asking you that? This is my house, my room!"


Isabella opened her mouth, wanting to explain but feeling it unnecessary.

After all, she came to see Aiden. Since he was back, she would leave.

As she got up to leave, Michael grabbed her wrist and pushed her back down.


His voice was weak and hoarse, but his grip was strong. "Why are you
running? Weren't you just demanding a divorce from me two days ago?Now you're regretting it and trying to seduce me by lying in my bed?"


"Seduce you in your bed?" Isabella sneered. She admitted that Michael's handsomeness could make her dazed.


But after three years, his coldness had worn out her patience.

No matter how good-looking Michael was, she had lost interest.


"I was sleeping here peacefully, and you sneaked into the room and pinched me. You took advantage of me and now want to slander me." She couldn't help but raise her voice. "Do you want to look at my face? The marks are the best evidence!"


Isabella pointed to her red, hot cheek, her eyes full of anger.

Michael saw it too.


His eyes flickered. He thought he was hallucinating earlier, so he wanted to touch her to see if she was real.

He didn't control his strength.

"Let me see." Michael lowered his head and moved closer to her face.


"Stay awvay." Isabella, nervous, hit her head on the bed's switch,plunging the room into darkness again.


Only their intertwined breaths and the faint moonlight remained.


Michael's perfect face was magnified in front of her, his deep, dark eyes exuding a bewitching allure that deeply attracted her.

The scent of male hormones overwhelmed her, and Isabella blushed.
"Stay away from me." Isabella turned her head, trying to push Michael away.She kept moving to the side, almost falling off the bed.


Fortunately, Michael's large hand caught her, pulling her back undder him.their bodies intertwined again.


Isabella pushed against him, but Michael was like a mountain pressing down on her.


Unable to move him, she could only vent her anger with words."You were hiding.Why come back now?"


Michael, feeling unwell. initially planned to talk things out with her.Hearing her mention this, he endured the discomfort to argue with her."Isabella.Have you forgotten the agreement you signed? As soon as Daniel s condition improved. you asked for a divorce and made the whole Evergreen City know while I was away!"


Michael narrowed his eyes, "How does it feel to see the news of you being dumped by the Brown Group's heir on the headlines?"

He pinned her hands to the pillow, his eyes in the dark like a hungry wolf,ready to devour her.


Isabella was too scared to speak.

Michael stared at her, his gaze turning from scrutiny to heat, "Isabella, do we really have to divorce?"


Isabella's eyelids twitched.

She instinctively lowered her eyes, avoiding Michael's eyes.

She didn't believe it was real. "I've already given you the answer. This
marriage must end!"
###Chapter 50 Overthinking

He was the one who didn't want to get married at first, and for three years after the wedding. he ignored her and treated her coldly.

Even when she put aside all her pride to please him, she couldn't get a shred of warmth from him.


Now she had figured it out.

She wouldn't go back.

Michael's eyes were deep. "Then what are you doing here,lying in our marital bed? Didn't you say everything here has nothing to do with you?"

He questioned her hoarsely. propping himself up to loom over her.


His gaze swept over her, almost imperceptibly.

Isabella sensed unease, wriggling to escape, but in doing so,she repeatedly teased MichaeI's fraying nerves.

They were very close, and she was only wearing a thin, gauzy nightgown.


Michael's eyes turned red with restraint.

Isabella, however, was unaware. "Michael, don't overthink it. I'm just here to visit Aiden. It has nothing to do with you."

"Really? Then prove to me that you don't feel anything for me!" Michael grabbed her chin and kissed her hard.

He didn't believe Isabella had no feelings for him at all. Otherwise, she wouldn't have stayed in this house for three years and cared for him so attentively.
He even missed the Isabella from before she talked about divorce.

Back then, she would make him delicious food and have hot water ready for his bath before he got home from work.


But the current Isabella gave him the feeling that she could leave him at any moment.


No matter what he did. he couldn't keep her.


Michael's kiss grew deeper and more domineering. When his large hand slipped under her dress. Isabella bit his lip hard and kicked him off the bed.


"Michael. I'm not your wife anymore. If you touch me again, I'll call the police and accuse you of sexual assault!" Isabella wiped her lips harshly with the back of her hand. "And stay away from me. Just seeing you makes me sick!"


Isabella's words made Michael's desire die down.

His face turned dark. "Isabella, don't regret this."

With that, he grabbed his coat and slammed the door on his way out.


Isabella, lying in bed, was wide awake, glaring at the door with gritted teeth.


She wouldn't regret it. She only regretted not checking his whereabouts before coming.ending up running into him in bed.


The next day.

Isabella got up early to help Sophia prepare desserts for Aiden.
Aiden had been eating less lately, but seeing Isabella's effort, he ate some more dessert and felt much better.


Isabella accompanied him for a walk in the backyard.


The air was great on an early autumn morning. and the garden's various exotic flowers were in full bloom. Isabella and Aiden chatted and laughed.even video-calling Daniel in the hospital.

The three of them talked for quite a while.


As they were about to leave. Isabella's smile vanished when she saw something in the distance.


Michael and Bianca were walking side by side toward the garden.


Michael had arranged for Indigo's family to stay in an apartment under his name. Harper had brought Bianca over early in the morning to thank him,but more importantly,to see Michael.


"Michael, I don't mean to speak ill of Isabella, but she went too far this time. She kicked our whole family out and exposed us online." Bianca wiped her tears. "She even wants to drive us out of Evergreen City."

"She's just talking." Michael didn't think Isabella had that kind of power.

Bianca felt indignant, sensing that Michael was always siding with Isabella."But why does Isabella have to be so ruthless? I've already been very accommodating to her, yet she still wants to make things difficultfor me."


Michael always thought Thomas had given Isabella the confidence to divorce.


Although Thomas was part of the Wilson Family, he wasn't the heir to the
Wilson Group.

Thomas was currently busy with his own company and had his hands full.but the heir to the Wilson Group was giving him a headache.


He was preparing to acquire the Crystal Cove resort.

But the Wilson Group had suddenly shown interest in the project as well.


As far as he knew, the Wilson Group had just resolved its financial issues,yet they dared to compete with the Brown Group for a project. This mysterious heir was quite ambitious.

He wanted to see for himself what she was up to.

"Aiden, the doctor is coming soon. Let Sophia take you back to your room.I want to walk around a bit more and will join you shortly." Seeing the two approaching. Isabella deliberately stoodin front of Aiden to block his view.


Aiden was determined to have her return to the Brown Family. If he saw the two of them walking closely together, he would be furious.

Fortunately. Aiden didn't think much of it.He smiled and nodded,telling Isabella to stay a bit longer and relax.

After Sophia took Aiden away, Isabella also planned to leave, not wanting any interaction with the two.


But asshe turned, she ran into Stella and Harper.

Behind them were Michael and Bianca, and she didn't want to see either group.


At that moment, she felt the Brown Family's backyard was too small.
"You say you're not trying to get back into the Brown Family,yet you're still here the next day, shamelessly waiting for Michael to come back, aren't you?" Stella got angry at the sight of Isabella.

She was ready to settle yesterday's score.

Harper hated Isabella even more. No matter how nice Michael's apartment was, it wasn't her house.


Knowing that the house Isabella had taken was now worth millions of dollars. Harper felt like her heart was bleeding.

Harper said. "Isabella, your father and I raised you for so many years. Not only did you not help us. but you also took our house. You're just as bad as your mother. doing all sorts of evil. You'll get your comeuppance sooner or later!"


Isabella had planned to avoid these annoying people.

She didn't expect them to come looking for a fight.

Did they think she would be scared just because there were more of them?

One or two made no difference to her.

"Harper, you'd better watch your mouth. Don't say anything you can't take back. What right do you have to mention my mother? If anyone's going to get their comeuppance, it'll be you first. You should go to hel!" Isabella cursed with satisfaction.


Michael and Bianca heard the commotion and walked over.


Seeing a group of people she didn't want to see, Isabella cracked her neck."Fine, let's get this over with. Come at me all at once. Let's see what you'
ve got!"

She had no reason to hold back against a bunch of scumbags.

"Michael, look at her. She has no manners at all, not even sparing my mom. How can she be like this?" Bianca pulled Michael over, trying to show him Isabella's true colors.


Isabella sneered. "What, are you in a hurry because it's not your turn yet?Your family lived in my mom's house for over a decade. The three of you together don't have a single brain cell. You should be grateful that I'm just telling you to get lost. And wipe that disgusting look off your face.You go online calling others mistresses and boyfriend-stealers. Aren't you the one actually seducing someone else's husband?"


Isabella easily traded insults with them.
###Chapter 51 Protecting Her

"Isabella,take a good look at where you are. This is the Brown Villa,not a place where you can act recklessly!" Seeing the situation.Stella tried to act tough.

"So what? Can you control my mouth or my legs? I'll say whatever I want and go wherever I please. Can you stop me?" Isabella said.

Stella's chest heaved with anger, but before she could speak, Isabella's red lips curved into a smnile. "You think I don't have the right, huh? You do?You can't even drink water without someone feeding you, and you cry for half a day over a broken nail. If you were in charge. the Brown Family would be finished!"

Stella was not only trembling with rage but also embarrassed by the exposure of her private matters.

Michael, standing to the side, was stunned.

He knew Isabella was articulate, but he had never seen such a heated scene before.


He had thought she would be bullied and wronged.

Unexpectedly, she could handle three people on her own without breaking a sweat.


"Isabella,you bitch! How dare you talk to me like that? I'm gonna smash your mouth today!"Stella's face turned red.


No one had ever dared to speak to her like that.

Yesterday,she couldn't beat Isabella, but today Michael was here, and he
would surely take her side.

But unexpectedly, it was Michael who stopped the slap.

Isabella was also stunned.

Was Michael out of his mind?

At this moment, shouldn't he be avenging Stella and Bianca? Yet he stopped Stella's slap for her!


"Michael, why are you stopping me? Isabella insulted me and you still siding with her?" Stella said.


"Mom.Isabella is my wife. If I don't side with her, who will? We haven't even divorced yet!" Michael frowned. "And why wouldn't she have a share in this family? She's my wife. so the Brown Family is hers too!"


Seeing Stella ready to strike, he seemed to understand what Isabella had endured these three years in the Brown Family.


He also understood why she was so determined to leave here, to leave him.


Her transformation into who she was today seemed inseparable from his three years of indifference.


He suddenly felt a pang of guilt.


Isabella had never complained to him about how his family treated her.

His realization came too late, and he only hoped to make it up to her, to prevent her from suffering any more grievances.


"Michae1, what nonsense are you talking about? How could the Brown Family be hers? Did Isabella drug you? How can you side with her!" Stella
shook off Michael's hand, clutching her stifled chest.


Harper and Bianca, standing nearby, also sensed something was wrong.

Bianca glanced at Michael secretly, but at this moment. Michael's eyes were only on Isabella.


Michael was the man she had loved for over a decade.How could Bianca not notice the change in his eyes?


Michael seemed to have genuinely fallen for Isabella and was even defying Stella for her.


Bianca's face turned grim.


Michael said. "Mom, just because I haven't said anything doesn't mean I don't know. You know how you've made things difficult for Isabella these past three years. Now that we're on the brink of divorce, isn't it enough?"


Hearing this. Bianca's heart trembled.


She hurried to stand by Stella's side to explain, "Michael,how can you say that about Mrs. Brown? Isabella asked for a divorce because she loves someone else. Mrs. Brown is doing this for you. What you're doing will break her heart!"


Bianca intentionally brought up Isabela and Thomas.

This was the one thing Michael cared about the most.

In the past, whenever this was mentioned, Michael would get extremely angry.

But this time, Bianca seemed to have miscalculated.
Michael gave her a cold glance, his eyes devoid of any emotion. "Bianca.you can have the apartment you're living in now, but from today on, don't let me see you causing trouble for Isabella again!"

Michael's powerful presence and the warning in his tone were undeniable.


Isabella was stunned.

She had prepared to make her move but Michael stepped in.

"Isabella, come with me!" Before Isabella could react, Michael had already grabbed her wrist and walked away briskly.

Although Isabella hadn't used her full strength, she had won this round completely.


Even Stella felt utterly humiliated.

Usually, she thought Harper was quite clever,but at the critical moment,she couldn't even handle Isabella.


No wonder he was driven out by Isabella.

And Bianca, Michael had just sided with Isabella so blatantly,yet she stood there like a wooden statue, not knowing what to say.

All she did was lower her head and cry. Michael had already left;what good was crying now?

Stella looked at the Harper and Bianca, shaking her head in dissatisfaction."Bianca, this won't do. Look at how Isabella won Michael over with just a few words. If you keep silent, you won't stand a chance."

"I understand, Mrs. Brown. I'll find opportunities to spend more time with Michael." Bianca said.
"It seems I have to step in personally. Isabella is not simple. Even though they're about to divorce, she can still enchant Michael. I need to have someone keep an eye on her to prevent any more changes!" Watching Isabella and Michael disappear. Stella narrowed her eyes.

Meanwhile.


Michael pulled Isabella to a corner of the garden, only to have her shake off his hand immediately.


"Michael, what are you doing? Ignoring your beloved Bianca to bother me?" Isabella was confused.


"Isabella.what do you really want?" Michael raised his voice.

"What I want? Didn't I make myself clear?" Isabella found it amusing.looking up at Michael coldly.

The phone rang. and Isabella answered it in front of him.


The person on the other end seemed to invite her out for the evening,and she agreed.


Just as she was about to leave, Michael grabbed her, frowning. "Where are you going? It's late, and you're still going out with someone?"

"Michael, do you hear yourself? What does it matter to you where I go?"Isabella tried to shake him off, but Michael's hand wouldn't move, and she couldn't break free.


"Don't go out. I'll agree to any request you have today." After speaking.Michael seemed afraid of what she might say next and quickly added,"Except for divorce!"
Isabella raised an eyebrow. "Then come with me to court tomorrow,and I won't go out tonight."


"Tomorrow is also no good. Isabella, we..."


Before Michael could finish. Isabella seized the opportunity to pull her hand away. "Then we have nothing to talk about."


Isabella walked away quickly, as if afraid Michael would follow her.

Michael stood there. feeling uneasy with his empty hand.


He had actually wanted to tell her not to bring up divorce again.

He thought. Isabella, stop this. Can't we go back to how things were?

Back in the bedroom, Michael lay on the bed, his arm over his forehead.
and called Aaron. "Get me all the recent movements of Mrs. Brown,
including where she's going tonight. Report everything to me."
###Chapter 52 Mistaken Identity

Michael instructed, "Additionally, continue investigating Mrs. Brown's past,using any means necessary."

Aaron nodded."Yes."

Just as Michael finished giving instructions, his friend Ethan called.inviting him out for some fun. "Don't just work all day. What's the difference between you and a robot?"

Michael was already in a foul mood from Isabella's leave, so he agreed immediately.

They met at a newly opened restaurant.

Since their last race, the two hadn't been in touch for a few days. Ethan,dressed in a white casual outfit with hair falling over his forehead, looked no different from a college student.

In contrast, Michael's handsome face was full of fatigue.


The difference between the two was stark.

The table was already set with food, and as soon as Michael arrived, Ethan started eating heartily, showing a great appetite.

Michael raised an eyebrow and poured himself a glass of wine. He really wasn't hungry. "You seem quite happy. What is it?"

Ethan took a sip of water, his eyes sparkling. "I recently joined a new racing team. The members are all college students, and there are quite a few beauties.Being with them every day makes me feel a lot younger."
"A racing team?" Michael knew Ethan liked these things but only as a hobby. Out of concern, he advised, "It's fine to play around, but don't get too involved. It's dangerous, and if your family finds out, you'll be in trouble!"


"I only told you about this. Don't let it get back to my parents. I don't want to be dragged home at my age; I'd go crazy." Ethan said.

"How old are you now? Can you live like this forever? I heard your family has lined up quite a few wealthy ladies for you. Aren't you going to meet them?" Michael smirked, finding amusement in Ethan's situation.

In their circle. Michael and Ethan were the closest in age, but their personalities were vastly different.

Ethan had always been rebellious, never willing to follow his family's orders.


At twenty-seven, he hadn't even had a serious relationship.

He even claimed to be a non-marriage advocate.

He wanted to be free for life.

Ethan's mother often asked Michael privately if Ethan liked men.

She was almost convinced they were a couple.

It wasn't until Michael married Isabela that the rumors were dispelled.

At the mention of blind dates. Ethan got a headache. "What's the point?They're all like Bianca, shy and speaking in whispers. They're not as interesting as Isabella!"

Hearing Isabella's name from another man's mouth, even if it was Ethan,
was unacceptable.

Michael's eyes turned cold, full of menace. "She's mine. Don't even think about it."


Ethan smirked, "I was just making a point. You protect her so much, why didn't you treat her better before? Now look at the mess. How are you going to fix it?"


Michael was silent for a moment.


He thought of the past three years, downed his drink in one gulp.

The bitterness spread from his throat to his heart.

He exhaled slowly. "I don't know what to do either, but the problem is I failed to be a good husband."


Michael understood how much Isabella had suffered in the past three years,and he wanted to make it up to her.

But he didn't know where to start.


Just then, Stella called. "Michael, I told you to divorce that bitch Isabella.but you didn't believe me. Look at what she's been doing behind your back!"


Stella quickly sent photos to Michael's phone.


Several high-definition shots showed Isabella sitting with a mature man,laughing and acting intimately.


The location was a hotel across from the restaurant he was in.


"When did this happen?" Michael frowned, recognizing the red dress
Isabella was wearing.

Stella said. "Just now. I knew she suddenly got so confident because someone was backing her. Luckily, I had someone watch her,or she would've ruined the Brown family's reputation! Why are you still keeping a woman like Isabella? She's so eager to divorce you; she might have already cheated on you with another man..."


Michael didn't listen to the rest. He stood up and headed straight to the hotel across the street, following the direction in the photos.

The front desk recognized the VIP suite in the photos.

When Michael arrived, he was stopped by black-suited bodyguards outside."Sorry, Ms. Wilson is in a meeting. No one can disturb her right now. If you have business.please wait."


Michael squinted, "Ms. Wilson? You mean the heir of the Wilson Group.Ms.Wilson?"


The bodyguard proudly lifted his chin, "Of course. The Wilson Group has only one Ms. Wilson. Who else could it be?"

From outside, Michael saw the familiar figure with long hair and a refined man sitting opposite her. He barged in. "Isabella, what are you doing here?”


The woman turned around, looking puzzled.


The woman who looked at him had the same lively eyes as Isabella,a beautiful face, and full red lips, exuding a unique charm.

She was undeniably beautiful but not in the same style as Isabella.
Their backs and figures were similar, but the sharpness and scrutiny in her eyes were not something Isabella would have.


Seeing Michael, Isabella's eyes slightly lifted, her brows showing displeasure at being intruded upon.


"Who are you looking for?" She looked at him, her voice cold as ice.


The icy tone brought Michael back to reality. She wasn't Isabella. "Sorry.you look too much like someone I know. I was in a hurry and made a mistake."


"Really?" Hearing his explanation. Isabella's interest piqued, her tone chilly."Who is it that made you so agitated?"


When Michael had rushed in, he looked anxious, very unlike his usual self.

She secretly hoped for his answer.


Michael had already calmed down. He discreetly observed the women in front of him but couldn't find any trace of the Isabella he knew.


He replied in a deep voice, "Just someone unimportant."


Isabella's hand clenched tightly at her side.


Unimportant?

She knew she wouldn't hear any compliments from Michael.


Isabella was furious inside but showed no sign of it.

She looked at Michael coldly, her tone even icier, "In that case, Mr. Brown,
I hope you can control yourself in the future. It's really rude to rush into someone else's room just because they look familiar!"
Michael was momentarily speechless.

But he quickly caught the key point. "You know who I am?"


He frowned,sensing a flaw.

Could she really be who he thought she was?
###Chapter 53 Should I Call You Isabella or Ms Wilson?


Isabella's response was a cold laugh. "Mr. Brown, you really have a poor memory. Who in the entire business world doesn't know that the Brown Group always suppresses the Wilson Group! Using the influence of Evergreen City to pressure major corporations just to snatch projects from me. I must say, you have quite the tactics."


From the moment the island project began. Michael had been curious about the Wilson Family heir.


Now that he saw her, she was exactly as he had imagined.


Isabella's aura and dominance clearly showed she had been in the business world for many years.


However, her relentless questioning made him feel a bit uncomfortable.

To suppress the Wilson Group, he had indeed recently instructed Aaron to intercept several collaborations that were originally meant for the Wilson Group.


He just wanted them to see the reality of the situation.

In Evergreen City, no one dared to oppose the Brown Group.


But this was the business world, and he didn't need to explain to anyone,"There are many reasons for failing to secure a collaboration, it's not necessarily due to someone else's suppression. Ms. Wilson, with your many years of business experience, surely you wouldn't care about those few small projects?"
"You..." Isabella was furious, her beautiful eyes glaring at Michael, clearly enraged by his words.


"Let's wait and see, shall we?" Neither of them was the type to back down,especially when it came to their own interests, so naturally, they wouldn't give an inch.


Isabella turned and said a few words to the man she was negotiating with.then got up and left with him.


As she reached the door, she didn't forget to give MichaeI a fierce glare.

Watching Isabella's departing figure. Michael couldn't help but frown.

She was so much like Isabella.

The same figure. the same style of dress, he still found it hard to believe there could be such a coincidence in the world.


But when Michael thought of Isabella's aggressive tone and the undeniable sharpness in her demeanor, his suspicion subsided again.


When Aaron received the news and arrived, the entire private room was empty except for Michael.

Hearing that Michael had encountered the Wilson Group heir,Aaron,fearing it might cause some trouble, didn't dare to delay for a moment.

"Mr. Brown, did you get along well with with the Wilson Group heir?"Aaron asked cautiously.


Michael frowned and asked him back, "Did you find out Mrs. Brown's whereabouts as I asked?"


Aaron was taken aback, "Mrs. Brown hasn't left the house at all."
If he had found anything, he would have reported it to Michael.


Michael's frown deepened, he still couldn't believe there could be two people so alike in the world. "Find someone to investigate the Wilson Group heir's information, as quickly as possible."


Aaron responded, wanting to ask if he should still track Isabella's whereabouts, but seeing the gloom on Michael's face, he swallowed his words.


Meanwhile.

As soon as Isabella left the hotel, she was picked up by a discreet black business car.


As soon as she sat down, she called Thomas.


Her voice changed from the cold tone earlier to her usual one, "Thomas,please help me!"


"Isabella, what's wrong?" Thomas had always been adoring Isabella.

"My identity might have been discovered by Michael. Can you find someone to cover it up for me?It's best if Michael doesn't find out anything." Isabella said.


Thomas quickly agreed. "Got it. If Michael wants to investigate your background, let him dream on!"


Isabella finally sighed inrelief.


She then had someone quickly take her back to the Brown Villa; Michael wouldn't let this go easily.


He would definitely try every possible way to confirm she was Ms. Wilson.
Isabella guessed right.

She had just entered her room ten minutes ago when Michael followed closely behind.

The door was pushed open forcefully, and Michael called her name in a deep voice, "Isabella, come out!"

The entire room was empty.

Before Michael could call out a second time. Isabella, wrapped in a towel,pushed open the bathroom door.

Her hair was wet as she walked out, meeting Michael's furious gaze."Michael,what are you thinking? I'm just taking a bath. If you don't want to stay here. go sleep in the guest room. Don't disturb my rest."

Michael's eyes were sharp, as if he wanted to see through her completely.

The same figure, the same features.

But he couldn't pinpoint what felt off. Michael couldn't help but compare the Isabella he had just seen at the hotel with the one in front of him now.

He was certain that the person in front of him was Isabella; her mannerisms and speech were different from the one earlier.


Could he really be overthinking it?

But his instincts couldn't be wrong.


He narrowed his eyes, took a long stride towards Isabella, and pinned her against the wall, staring into her eyes as he asked, "Should I call you Isabella or Ms. Wilson?"
Michael watched Isabella's reaction closely.

But 'she didn't show a hint of panic.

She was as calm as if she had heard a stranger's name.


"If you're looking for someone else, go find them outside. Get out of my sight." Isabella's tone was indifferent, not taking it seriously at all.

Michael's face darkened. "Are you really not the Ms. Wilson?"


Hearing this. Isabella let out a cold laugh, as if she had heard an joke. her lips curling into a mocking smile. "Michael, what makes you think I look like Ms. Wilson? Even if I were a lady from the Wilson family, would I stay by your side.enduring your neglect for three years without complaint?1


Isabella took a deep breath, stood on her tiptoes, and met Michael's gaze.the two of them so close there was almost no distance between them.


Michael didn't expect her to be so angry, feeling guilty, he took two steps back.


Isabella was used to his reaction; it would be strange if he didn't back off.

After all, he didn't like her.

How could he tolerate her getting close?


Isabella smirked self-deprecatingly, turned, and went into the walk-in closet. She had left in a hurry last time, so there were still many of her clothes inside.


Now they were just right for her to wear.
Just as she was about to close the door to change, a large hand blocked it.and Michael stood in front of her.


"What do you want?" Isabella's face was cold, her tone devoid of any emotion.


Seeing her disdainful attitude. Michael felt very uncomfortable. and an inexplicable desire to keep her rose within him.


"I want an explanation, or you admit that you're not her!"

Isabella's eyelid twitched hard.

Sometimes she really wondered if she had lost her mind back then, falling for Michael,such a bad man.


And now he wanted an explanation from her?

"Michael, if you've taken a fancy to another woman,go find her outside. If you want to go crazy, do it outside. Don't cause trouble in front of me,okay?" With that, she pushed his hand away, trying to slam the door shut.


But she underestimated Michael's strength; she pushed harder, but he didn't budge.


He stood there like a mountain, staring at her intently.


A different kind of emotion flashed in his eyes, "Fine, then explain everything that's happened recently, what you've done, and make it clear to me!"


He had lost patience waiting to find out her information;he wanted her to say it herself.
###Chapter 54 She Wasn't Afraid of It

Isabella's fists were clenched tightly. What right did Michael have!


She sneered coldly, "I can help you recall. We proposed our divorce agreement a month ago. As long as you sign it, we have no more ties. So,whatever I do and whoever I meet have to do with you!"


Her indifferent attitude made Michael very unhappy. He grabbed her face.asserting his dominance. "Let me tell you, as long as I don't agree to the divorce, you are still mine, the Mrs. Brown of this house. Got it?"

Isabella's mouth hurt from his grip.

She couldn't say a word.

Suddenly,she thought of something, squinted at Michael, and changed her expression. "Michael, are you trying so hard to keep me because you've really fallen in love with me?"


Her eyes were seductive, and her slender fingers climbed up his big hand,teasing him subtly.


Michael's eyes flickered.

Isabella's mocking smile grew more triumphant, "Looks like I am right."

Michael's expression changed, and he quickly withdrew his hand from hers.his tone somewhat defensive, "Isabella, can you be any more narcissistic? I'm not divorcing you for the sake of family interests. The mess you're making affects not only the Brown Family's reputation but also the stock price. Any losses will be on you."

Isabella tilted her head and looked at him.
She wanted to know what he was really thinking.

Michael said, "Don't forget, we have an agreement. If you dare to leave without my consent. how do you think that will be settled? And also settle Sean's consultation fee."


This made Isabella angry.

He knew Daniel was seriously ill and needed surgery urgently. yet he deliberately hid Sean to blackmail her.


In the end, he was just a businessman, and everything revolved around money.


Isabella said. "You just want money. right? How much do you want? I'll pay you. and we'll be even!"

Michael raised an eyebrow. She loved money so much that it was surprising to hear such words from her.

But Thomas seem to be quite wealthy, he wanted to see how far Thomas would go for her.


"Ten billion dollars!" Michael's voice was firm.

Isabella was stunned on the spot.

She stared at him with wide eyes, "Ten billiondollars? Do you think I'm a cash cow? Why don't you go rob a bank!”


She had truly underestimated Michael's moral bottom line.


Not only would she get no money from the divorce, but she would also have to give him ten billion dollars!
She took a deep breath and charged at him, gritting her teeth, "Dream on.I won't give you any money."

With that, she pushed him and slammed the door shut.

She didn't care if it would hurt his hand. It would be better if it did; it would make her feel better.


Isabella cursed Michael while looking for clothes.




Outside. Michael listened to Isabella cursing him inside and had no intention of leaving. He sat down on a chair by the window.


He slowly listened to her curse to her heart's content.

Inside. Isabella dried her hair and changed into pajamas before coming out.She looked up and saw Michael sitting by the window, legs crossed,watching her.

His eyes looked weird.

She felt a bit guilty. Could it be that he had heard her cursing for so long?


Impossible. Michael was such a proud man. He would have smashed the door if he did. How could he endure until now?

"What are you doing sitting here? Aren't you leaving?" Isabella said.


Michael opened his mouth, the words circling in his mouth before he finally spoke, "Since you can't come up with the money to compensate for my losses, then stay as Mrs. Brown. That's the identity you should have.Remember that!"
Isabella's anger. which had just subsided. surged again.


How could he have the nerve to say such things!

Before she could retort. her phone on the table suddenly rang.

She took a deep breath. glared at Michael, and picked it up. "Who is it?"


A polite male voice came from the other end. "Is this Ms. Taylor? I'm Aiden's personal lawyer. There's something important I need to discuss with you."


Hearing it was someone from Aiden. Isabella's voice softened. "Go ahead."

"Mr. Brown's previous instructions have been sorted out. Do you have time tomorrow to sign the stock transfer agreement?"


The voice on the phone wasn't loud, but Isabella immediately felt Michael's sharp gaze.


How could she not know what he was thinking?

Those were his tests just now. The shares Aiden gave were the real deal.


If she really accepted Aiden's gift. Michael would be truly anxious!

After all, he was the one sitting in the heir's position. Taking those shares would be like taking his life.


"I don't have time, and I won't sign." She was just placating Aiden at the time. If she really took those shares. Michael would never let hergo.

The lawyer was troubled, "Ms. Taylor,you know Mr. Brown's health hasn't been good lately, and he's often worried. If you refuse his gift again, it might worsen his health."
Isabella fell silent.

Aiden's poor condition was partly her fault. If his health worsened because of her, she would feel even more guilty.

After a moment, she took a deep breath,"Alright. I'll go over tomorrow."


She knew that if she refused here. Aiden would get the news in less than a minute.


She could only compromise for now.

Strangely, Michael didn't say anything. not even showing any extra expression.


Isabella thought he would continue to mock her.


Seeing him silent,she put down her phone and cleared her throat,"I'm going to rest. You shouldn't stay here."


Seeing her expression, Michael's lips curled into a mischievous smile,"This is my bedroom too. Why should I leave? I'm going to sleep."


Isabella was speechless.

Seeing his determined look, she nodded, "Fine, I'm going to sleep. Do as you please."


After all, he had never been interested in her. In their three years of marriage, they had shared a bed doing nothing before.


She wasn't afraid of it


Isabella pulled up the covers and lay down. After a while, she heard the sound of water from the bathroom.
She couldn't remember when Michael lay down.

But she was still familiar with his cold scent.


At night, Isabella woke up thirsty and got up to find water.


She sat up and realized that the only blanket on the bed was rolled up under her. Michael, on the other side, was only wearing a dark black robe,with nothing underneath.


He actually stayed.

It was autumn, and the temperature was a bit low.


The air conditioning wasn't on, and Michael's tall figure lay there, curled up.hugging himself,looking strangely pitiful.
###Chapter 55 You Don't Deserve My Manners

She quickly looked away and got up to pour herself a glass of water.

When she sat back on the bed, she saw Michael in that state again. Biting her lip,she couldn't help but get up and open the closet.

She found a blanket inside and brought it to the bed.

After casually covering him with it. Isabella stared at Michael's face illuminated by the orange light, unconsciously entranced.

She had to admit, it seemed God favored Michael.

Even though she thought MMichael was awful, his features were exceptional.with a prominent brow bone, and his face was so perfect that even she,as a woman,felt envious.


She maintained this posture, looking at him for a full few minutes.

Until a deep, cold voice pulled her back to reality. "How long are you going to keep staring?"


Isabella never expected Michael to be pretending to sleep.

Feeling tricked, she immediately withdrew all her emotions.


She had been worried he might freeze to death in the room, but it turned out he was just pretending.


She was furious.

Isabella straightened up and snorted, "I'm looking at you. You're almost thirty, do you really think you're still young and handsome?"
Michael fully opened his eyes, anger simmering in them.

One day, he would be driven to death by her sharp tongue.

Before Isabella could turn around, Michael reached out and pulled her into his arms.


Isabella clearly had feelings for him but refused to admit it.


He dominantly kissed her lips. and taking advantage of her gasp. Michael easily pried open her teeth. When his tongue touched hers. Isabella's eyes widened.


She was no match for his strength; her hands were pinned above her head as Michael deepened the kiss.


They felt hoter and hoter.

Michael was incredibly domineering. At first, he was just testing, but he gradually let go, entwining her tongue and even making sounds.

His hands didn't stay idle either, moving from her waist upwards until they grasped her soft breasts, kneading them.

Isabella instantly snapped back to reality.


She found it unbelievable.


Michael wanted to have sex with her, and she had to agree. For three years,she had wanted a child countless times, but he wouldn't even spare her a glance and used hurtful words to humiliate her.


Seeing that Michael was about to bite her neck. Isabella pushed him away without hesitation, "Michael, get off!"


The intimate atmosphere was abruptly interrupted by her push.

Michael,unprepared,almost fell off the bed.


Anyone would be upset if kicked away at such a moment, let alone the high-and-mighty Michael.


His face turned cold.

At this point, he couldn't bring himself to coax Isabella. so he got up and went to the bathroom.


Only cold water could calm him down now.

He had thought that Isabella finally cared about him when she quietly brought him a blanket, but she was still as fiery as ever.

They weren't even divorced, so why couldn't he kiss her?

The next morning.

Perhaps last night's events were too infuriating. Isabella still looked upset when she got up.


She angrily said to Michael, who was changing clothes, "Either you move next door today, or I will. Don't let me see you again."


Michael had already figured out Isabella's temper and saidI nothing.

Isabella glared at him and walked out the door.


She had a lot to do today; there was still alot of work waiting for her at the Wilson Group.


And a few promising projects that she needed to oversee personally.
Even so, before leaving, she still went to check on Aiden as usual. Aiden was still asleep, and she didn't let Sophia wake him up before she left.

But as soon as her car left the Brown Villa. Isabella noticed something was off.


Someone was following her.


Two groups of people. One group even came from the Brown Family.

One group was very discreet, but she still noticed them. The other group didn't even try to hide.


Michael's people wouldn't be stupid enough to expose themselves.The only one who would be so blatant and unafraid of being discovered was...

Only the foolish and arrogant Stella.


Isabella glanced at the route and took a left turn at the next intersection.shaking off the followers and heading to a restaurant Stella often went to for breakfast.


Stella's people were clearly coming after her, so she decided to go to her directly.


After entering. Isabella went straight to the private room on the second floor, which was Stella's exclusive spot, with a beautiful view of Evergreen City's river.


She pushed the door open, and sure enough, Stella was there.


Stella was sipping soup with her fingers, and when she saw Isabella enter uninvited, she was startled, her face showing obvious disgust. "You really are a country bumpkin, don't even know how to knock. Do you have any
manners?"

Isabella couldn't be bothered with her and walked straight to her,sitting down.


No matter what she did in the past three years. Stella was never happy about it. She later realized that Stella just didn't her.

Even if she tried everything. Stella wouldn't give her a second glance.

Then why bother pleasing someone who didn't like her?

"You don't deserve my manners. For you, it's not necessary and a waste of time. So, tell me, why did you have someone follow me? What do you want?"


Isabella's tone was direct as she stared at Stella.

Stella was taken aback, not expecting Isabella to confront her so directly.

But she did have her reasons.

No matter how Isabella changed, she just couldn't bring herself to like her.


She wanted someone with better background, someone gentle and considerate who could help Michael, not a country bumpkin who knew nothing and only dragged Michael down.


After thinking for a moment, Stella elegantly wiped her hands and took out an agreement from her bag.


She placed it in front of Isabella. "If you're smart enough,sign this.As long as you divorce Michael, you will get money and a house. Otherwise,if you drag this out, you won't keep your position as Mrs. Brown, and you can forget about getting any money."
Stella's attitude was condescending, as if she were doing Isabella a favor.

For someone like Isabella, this amount of money was probably something she had never seen in her life.


Isabella raised an eyebrow and picked up the agreement Stella had prepared.


But she was more curious about Stella.


How much did Stella look down on her to carry Michael's divorce agreement with her at all times?

The agreement was detailed. mostly targeting her.

But she had to admit, the terms were tempting.

If it were before, she might have been tempted, but now...

Isabella put the document back on the table and sighed, "It's not that I can't sign it. Michael is the problem. If he doesn't agree to the divorce, what can I do? Of course, if you can convince him, that would be great."

Isabella shrugged,feeling helpless.

But to Stella, Isabella's actions and tone seemed like mockery and showing off.
###Chapter 56 Mrs. Brown's Body Is Really Sof

Stella sneered coldly. "I think you've really lost your mind. Clearly, you're the one clinging to Michael. How could it be that Michael doesn't want to divorce you? He's so perfect, so outstanding. why would he want to keep you?"


As soon as she finished speaking. Stella's sharp gaze fell on Isabella's neck.and her eyes widened instantly. "What is that on your neck?"


Stella pointed at her. unable to contain her anger.

She wasn't blind.

The marks on Isabella's neck were clearly love bites from a man!


So obvious,so deep.


"How dare you cheat on Michael with another man!" Stella's voice grew louder and louder.


No one knew better than her how much Michael disliked Isabella. He hadn't touched Isabella in three years, so those marks must have been left by another man.


The thought of Isabella having an affair with someone else in the Brown Villa made Stella furious.


Stella was so angry that her hair felt like it was standing on end. Isabella sat in her chair, rubbing her temples helplessly.


She truly admired Stella's lung capacity. At her age, where did she get the energy to yell at her every day?
"The only man in my room is Michael. Even if I were to cheat. I wouldn't do it in front of him. would I?" Isabella said slowly, "Maybe he's part dog.biting all over me, but he's got some skills."


She had realized that whenever she mentioned being intimate with Michael.Stella's face would change dramatically. making her want to laugh.


"It can't be Michael. It must be you. Did you drug him? You wretch,what wouldn't you do to have a child?" Stella's fingers trembled with rage, and she glared at Isabella with fierce eyes.


As if she wanted to kill her.

Last night. Michael had indeed gone to the second floor and hadn't come down. Could it really be...

No. she couldn't let Michael and Isabella be together any longer.

Men were creatures driven by their desires, and Isabella was skilled at seduction. If Michael couldn't resist and ended up with Isabella, she would be finished!


After a moment of thought, Stella called a waiter over, whispered something to him, and then returned to her dignified demeanor as a wealthy lady.


As if nothing had happened.

Moments later, the waiter brought up some tea.


He placed it in front of Isabella, "Miss,this is specially ordered for you by Mrs. Brown. Please try it."


Isabella remained calm, not even glancing at it.
Stella couldn't hold back any longer. She bit her lip and lowered her voice."Isabella, I was wrong to blame you earlier. But I'm doing this for your own good. You see. Michael has no feelings for you. Why continue to cling to him? Why not get a divorce and free yourself? How about this, take the contract and think it over. I'll talk to Michael as well."


Saying this, Stella personally pushed the cup closer to Isabella. "You haven't eaten anything since you got up early. right? Try the tea here;it tastes really good."


If she didn't bite her lip hard. Isabella feared she might laugh out loud.

Three years had passed. and Stella hadn't learned a thing.

Did Stella think she was a toothless child?

A few words wouldn't fool her.


If she didn't drink the tea, Stella might not be able to proceed with her plans.


Thinking about the people Michael had sent to follow her from the Brown Family this morning, she paused, then picked up the cup of tea in front of her.


A smile curved on her red lips, "Alright, I hope you keep your word!"


With that, she took a sip of the tea.

Seeing her drink the tea, the warmth on Stella's face slowly faded.


UntilIsabella collapsed on the table, unconscious.

Stella snorted coldly, then picked up her phone and made a call,"Gmore people over here."
After separating from Isabella, Michael went straight to the office.

The project abroad had been handled,but there were more things to deal with domestically.


During the meeting, he kept glancing at his phone.


The people he had sent to follow Isabella hadn't sent any updates. Could something have happened?


The senior executives reporting to him didn't know whether to stop and wait for Michael to refocus or to pretend they hadn't noticed and continue their reports.

Everyone knew Michael was a workaholic.

If there was any mistake in the reports, he would be the first to notice.

He was always serious and meticulous about his work.

This kind of distraction was rare, and they had never seen it before.

The reporting continued, but the voices were quieter.

A notification sound rang out, and Michael immediately looked over.


[Mr.Brown, Mrs. Isabella Brown went to see Mrs. Stella Brown.They are now dining together in a restaurant.]

A simple message, but Michael's face twisted.

Isabella and Stella, dining together?

Michael knew how much Stella disliked Isabella. The idea of them sitting together for a meal, especially with Isabella initiating it, seemed absurd.
Michael was contemplating whether to call and ask when his phone flashed again.


It was an anonymous message.

It contained several photos.

He frowned and opened them, and got shocked.

In the photos. a woman was completely naked, her waterfall-like hair spread out on white sheets. her face deliberately covered.


There was a caption below: [Mrs. Brown's body is really soft.]


Michael's anger flared, and he stood up abruptly, his face dark as he strode out.


No one in the meeting room dared to ask a single question, fearing they might provoke Michael.


Michael went straight to the underground parking lot, staring at the descending elevator numbers, his fingers turning white from thepressure.

His anger was almost consuming all his reason and calm.

Once in the car, he called his subordinate to get Isabella's location and sped towards the destination.


Isabella,how dare she!

Last night, she had been so repulsed when he touched her, and now,early in the morning, she used the excuse of meeting Stella to fool around with another man?


Did she think that by pushing him to this extent, he would let go?
She better give up.

On the road, a black shadow sped by, and Michael's reason was almost entirely consumed by his anger. He just wanted to see Isabella immediately.

Meanwhile, in the restaurant's private room.


Isabella sat in her chair, shaking a teacup in her hand, looking coldly at the strong men in front of her. "Stop pretending. You're all as strong as bulls.Harder!"


The strong men knelt in front of Isabella, wearing only thin underwear.Hearing Isabella's command. their faces turned pale. They covered their groins with one hand and slapped their faces hard with the other.

As they slapped, they cursed themselves as Isabella commanded.
###Chapter 57 You're Too Much!

Seeing this, Isabella's expression finally softened a bit as she took a sip of tea.


She thought Stella had some sophisticated tricks up her sleeve.

It turned out she just found a few men to strip her clothes and take photos of her "sleeping with" other men in public.

The men she found did fit Isabella's aesthetic, but they were not tough enough.


They were knocked down in just a few rounds.

Not even enough for her to practice on.

As soon as Stella made that phone call, she had secretly spat out the tea in her mouth, waiting for those men to come in.


Before they could react, she had already subdued them on the ground.

She hadn't practiced martial arts for over ten years for nothing.

Suddenly, urgent footsteps were heard outside. Isabella put down her teacup,guessed who it was, and a slow smile appeared on her lips.

Finally,they were here.

The real show was about to begin.

The then the men kneeling on the ground watched as Isabella,who had just beaten them to the ground, stood up, tore her clothes, messed up her hair, and made her eyes red.
Her face showed a look of panic, as if she had suffered a great grievance.

The men were still stunned, wondering what she was up to.


Immediately after. the door behind them was kicked open.


A tall figure,full of anger. walked in.


Michael had already imagined the scene he would see before coming.but seeing it with his own eyes. he still couldn't believe it.





He felt anger and rage. He wanted to strangle her.

The men on the ground looked at Isabella,then at Michael, not knowing how to explain.

Michael gritted his teeth. "Isabella. I really underestimated you. You like to play so much that you called four male models at once to satisfy you?"

Before Isabella could speak, the men kneeling on the ground turned pale with fright and shook their heads frantically.


They were wronged!

The photos were fake, and the messages were sent by Isabella.


They thought they had taken a quick money job, but ended up getting beaten, locked up, and now caught by Michael.

Isabella looked like she was insulted and uncomfortable. She bit her lip,and tears fell one by one after holding them back for a while. "Michael, are you blind? Clearly, it's Stella who can't make peace with me. I came to see her out of kindness, but she drugged me and found so many men to lock
me in a room. If I hadn't discovered it in time. you would have seen me being..." She didn't say the rest.


Isabella cried. covering her face with her hands. "Michael. I haven't even divorced you yet. and your family treats me like this. Now you're blaming me? You... you're too much!"

Afraid of gettingexposed, she didn't dare to look Michael in the eye.

Her words weighed heavily on Michael's heart.

He didn't know the truth and almost wronged her.


Seeing her cry so sadly, a part of his heart felt a sharp pain.

Noticing the guilt on Michael's face. Isabella walked straight to him and.under everyone's gaze.slapped him!

Isabella finally vented her anger.

But her face still showed a look of grievance, as if she was about to cry."You and Stella are the same. If she thinks I'm clinging to the Brown Family and won't leave, she should just say so. No need to humiliate me like this. And you, I know you don't want to have children with me,but you shouldn't use such vicious means against me!"

She raised her head, her eyes filled with deep hatred, "Michael, let me tell you, the father of my child doesn't have to be you. I can find whoever I want, and none of you can control me!"


Michael was stunned by the slap, and by the time he reacted, Isabella had already left the room.


She ran in a hurry, as if she didn't want to stay by his side for even a
minute.

Ignoring the burning pain on his face, Michael instructed his subordinate who had followed. "Follow her, prioritize her safety."


Then, he looked at the mess in the room and the four men kneeling on the ground.


His brow furrowed tightly.

He had cleared the entire floor, and now no one could get in.

As Michael approached step by step. the four men on the ground didn't dare to move.


It wasn't that Michael did anything, but his natural oppressive aura made people feel suffocated.


Michael sat in the seat Isabella had just occupied,touching the teacup she had used, his voice cold as ice. "Who sent you?"

The men kept their heads down, too scared to lift them, stammering. "It was Mrs.Stella Brown!"


Michael's face turned completely dark.

It really was Stella who sent them.


Damn it!

Thinking about the things he said when he first came in, the marks on Isabella's body, and the tears that fell from her eyes. Michael felt a pang of heartache.


He shouldn't have questioned her like that without finding out the truth.
No wonder she was so angry and wanted to hit him; he deserved it.

Now he just wanted to find her. She had just gone through such an ordeal.and he was afraid she might do something impulsive.


Just as he was about to get up, a subordinate came in from outside.Seeing him about to leave, he looked at the kneeling men with some difficulty,"Mr. Brown, what should we do with them?"


The men on the ground were trembling and begging for mercy.

Their faces were swollen from the slaps, their legs were numb from kneeling. and they thought they had taken an easy job.only to almost lose their lives.


Michael glanced coldly. "Don't let me see them in Evergreen City again!"

The subordinate took the order, "Yes, Mr. Brown."


Just as Michael was about to drive to catch up with Isabella, the subordinate he had sent to follow her in the morning ealled. "Mr. Brown,Mrs. Brown changed her route, and we lost her."

Michael punched the steering wheel,"Useless!"


Isabella's emotions were clearly unstable just now, and with no one by her side, if she acted impulsively... he couldn't bear to think about it.


Just as he was feeling frustrated, Stella called him. "Michael, this time I really caught that bitch Isabella cheating. She was out fooling around with several men at once, not even leaving a piece of clothing on. Why are you still keeping a woman like Isabella? I'm telling you, the Brown Family can't tolerate such a promiscuous woman. You should divorce her immediately!
”
Stella had arranged everything, just waiting for Michael to agree and then completely kick Isabella out of the Brown Family.

Unexpectedly, Michael's icy voice came through the phone."Mom,how long are you going to keep pretending? Didn't you plan this whole thing?"

Stella was stunned.

She wasn't shocked that Michael found out, but that her own son Michael would speak to her in such a cold tone.


She immediately became nervous. "Michael. have you been bewitched by that bitch Isabella again? How could I possibly do such a thing?"
###Chapter 58 If I Win, You Belong to Me?

Isabella's departure, combined with what just happened, had pushed Michael's anger to its peak.


He didn't want to hear any more o Stella's lies disguised as being for his own good.


Nor did he want to hear a single bad word about Isabella from her mouth.

"Mom, Isabella and I will never get divorced. Stay out of our business!"After saying this, Michael hung up on Stella.

He didn't give her a chanceto continue defending herself.


On the other end. Stella stared at the abruptly disconnected phone, her heart tightening.


Michael was genuinely angry just now!

But how did he know she was behind this?


Regardless of who told him, she was now more worried about Michael's temper. Once he made up his mind, he never changed it.

Could it be that he would really abandon her, his own mother, for Isabella?

The thought alone scared Stella.

She didn't dare to think further.

After all,Michael was her biological son, and she knew him well enough to know that he meant what he said.


Michael had sent all his subordinates to look for Isabella. Even if he had
to turn Evergreen City upside down,he would find her.

This time, he was in the wrong.


He realized his mistake and didn't want Isabella to hurt herself because of his fault.


While Michael was frantically searching all the places she might be,a message suddenly popped up on his phone.


[Queen of Racing reappears at Everpeak Mountain after three years!]


Michael wanted to ignore it. but the familiar figure from that night on Sunset Ridge Highway flashed in his mind.

Given Isabella's current need to vent. could she be there?

Unconsciously, Michael drove to the base of Everpeak Mountain.

It was as if something was guiding him.

Maybe Isabella was really there!


He parked his car in a prominent spot and was immediately surrounded by onlookers as he got out.


Many were stunned at the sight of Michael.


Although most of the people here were rich kids, it was rare to see someone like Michael, dressed in a custom-made suit, with striking looks and a powerful aura.


Many girls blushed just from looking at him, and some bold ones even approached him for his number.
"Hey handsome, want to make a friend?" The girl was dressed provocatively, with a red ribbon tied in her hair, camo paint on her face.and tanned skin. She was a lively and pretty mixed-race girl.

Seeing that Michael didn't respond, she handed him a pen and extended her palm, raising an eyebrow. "Write your number here. Call me after the race."


Bold and uninhibited was the nature of this crowd.

Michael paused for a moment, then wrote down Ethan's number.

Such a good opportunity. he naturally thought of Ethan.

Especially since Ethan was still single.

"My name is Cecilia Thorne. Call me tonight." Cecilia winked at Michael.and a chorus of whistles erupted behind her.


Michael remained unfazed and took the opportunity to ask, "I heard the Queen of Racing is coming tonight. Is that true?"

Hearing that Michael was here for the Queen of Racing, the light in Cecilia's eyes dimmed, but she quickly responded enthusiastically,"Of course it's true. It's estimated that two-thirds of the men here are here for her. Didn't expect a man like you to be here for her too. But she's currently racing.so you should be able to see her soon."


"Thanks!" Michael glanced at the location and started to move.


"Such a pity, but the Queen of Racing isn't someone you can easily get a date with. If she doesn't want you, you can always find me." Cecilia called out from behind.
A few minutes later, the roar of a motorcycle engine echoed as it sped back to the starting point.


All eyes were on the scene.

"Thirteen minutes and twenty seconds, undisputed first place."


"She truly is the Queen of Racing. After three years of absence,she returns undefeated."


The audience erupted in applause.


In the center of the crowd. a tall woman in a black bodysuit dismounted from her motorcycle. Her perfect figure. long legs. and every move captivated the onlookers.

Michael approached. mesmerized by the scene.

That familiar figure, even her walking posture,was identical to Isabella's.

Was she the one who escaped at the final point on Sunset Ridge Highway last time?


Michael strode forward, blocking the woman's path, and threw down a challenge, "I'll race you. If I win, you come with me tonight!"

Not only the woman but also the surrounding spectators were stunned by Michael's bold statement.

Michael's words were audacious.

Everyone knew the Queen of Racing's prowess. Michael's attempt to date her this way seemed misguided.

"So, if I win, you belong to me?" The woman's voice was cold, unlike
Isabella's.

"Of course. Do you dare to try?" Michael lowered his gaze, starinng intently into her exposed eyes, as if trying to confirm something.

Isabella chuckled softly, her tone mocking. "Sure, but I won't lose to you.Consider this race a lesson in humility. I remember, you were the one who lost to me on Sunset Ridge Highway.right?"

It was really her!

Michael's gaze deepened as he looked at her.

Isabella didn't look at him, instead smiling at the black sports car not far behind him. "So,you're going to race me with that?"

Michael didn't respond, turning to a young racer and tossing him the car keys. "This is yours. Your motorcycle is mine now."

Those who camne here were naturally wealthy, but Michael's limited-edition car wasn't something money could easily buy.

Its value far exceeded that of dozens of motorcycles.


The racer happily accepted.

Everyone around was envious. If they had known, they would have brought their best motorcycles.

Michael put on his helmet and exchanged a determined look with Isabella.


Both had a competitive glint in their eyes.


The signal gun was fired.
The two motorcycles shot forward like arrows, leaving only an echo behind.


"Oh my God, he's so fast. I thought he was just trying to get the Queen of Racing's attention, but he really has some skills."


The young man who had just received the luxury car was stunned by the speed of his motorcycle.


He looked incredulous. "Is that really my bike? How did he get that speed?Why am I always last?"


"Shame on you. It just means you're not good enough!" The people around him burst into laughter.


"Place your bets. Who do you think will win?"

"Do you even need to ask? I'm betting on the Queen of Racing. Didn't you hear her say that the guy already lost to her once? He's just trying to save face this time. If he had the skills, he wouldn't have lost."

"Exactly, I'm betting on the Queen of Racing too."
###Chapter 59 Fulfilling the Bet

At this moment, halfway up the mountain. Michael and Isabella were intensely focused on the steep mountain road ahead.

Everpeak Mountain was much more challenging than Sunset Ridge Highway.

Moreover. the late autumn evening was approaching quickly,and visibility was starting to decrease.

Michael kept scanning ahead while also keeping an eye on Isabella's condition.

He was afraid she would disregard her own safety to win, just like last time.

Their vehicles moved like ghosts through the mountains,fast and agile.

As they pressed through the curves, sparks flew from their cars.

With only a few dozen feet left to the final turn, Michael was still closely following.

Isabella's car had reached its top speed. If she couldn't take the lead at the last turn, she would have no chance to overtake him on the remaining stretch.


But accelerating through the turn was a huge risk.

She might skid off the track and crash into the guardrail.


But if she didn't, she would face losing the race.

She had done it before; as long as she maintained her balance through the
turn,she could make it.

In the last 15 feet. Isabella took an extremely low turn, pushing her speed to the maximum.


She overtook Michael at the last moment.

However, the slippery mountain ground made it impossible for her to maintain her balance. and her car skidded rapidly towards the slope.

At the critical moment. Michael used his car as a buffer. rushed over, and grabbed Isabella, rolling into the grass on the side.

Fortunately. both were wearing helmets and didn't suffer any serious injuries.


"Are you hurt?" Michael's eyes were only on her as he picked her up and checked her carefully.


"I'm fine, what about you?"

Isabella struggled to stand up. That moment was really dangerous. If Michael hadn't rushed over to grab her at the last second, she and her car might have slid down the mountain.


She could have died.

She didn't expect that in such a critical moment, he would protect a complete stranger. It seemed he wasn't as cold and heartless as she had imagined.


But why could he be kind to a stranger and not show any genuine feelings towards Isabella?

"Don't worry, I'm fine." Michael stood up, dusted off the grass and dirt.
and stood in front of her with a tense expression.


Seeing that he was really okay. Isabella nodded at him. walked over to her car,quickly checked it, and sped off.

She had to win tonight.


Since Michael had made her the bet, she wouldn't miss this opportunity.


Watching Isabella's fleeting figure. Michael's eyes darkened. and he quickly followed.


This wasn't the first time.


She really didn't care about her safety.


She was willing to risk her life to win!

"The Racing Queen is out first!"


"Twelve minutes and forty seconds, the Racing Queen, an absolute champion."


"No wonder she was the five-time consecutive champion; she keeps breaking her own records."


As the sexy black figure got off the bike, the crowd gathered around Isabella,cheering and celebrating.


Michael took off his helmet and felt a pang of jealousy as if his belonging had been stolen by someone else.


She once belonged to him.

But now, he wasn't sure if she still wanted to come back to him.
Pushing through the crowd. Michael's deep gaze fixed on her, his voice low and powerful. "You won. As per the bet. I'm yours tonight!"

Isabella's eyes were indifferent, with a hint of sarcasm.


She had just praised him for being responsible. for helping a stranger.but within minutes, he had shown his true colors.


He had chased her down Sunset Ridge Highway to the foot of the mountain. and now he was doing it again on Everpeak Mlountain?

He loved one after another. yet he still wouldn't divorce her.

Michael was truly despicable!

If he knew that the person under the helmet was his wife Isabella,whom he had neglected for three years, what would his expression be right now?

Thinking this, Isabella's eyes flickered. She casually took off her helmet,letting her long hair cascade down, blown wildly by the wind.


A beautiful and bold face appeared before everyone.

She looked at Michael, a mocking smile on her lips, "So, do you still want to keep playing?"

Michael's face showed surprisingly little reaction.


But the onlookers, seeing Isabella's true identity as Michael's wife,who had been hotly discussed online recently, were shocked.


Seeing the imposing Michael opposite her, they all backed away in fear.

They hadn't expected to see the people from the news in person.
These two were not to be messed with.

One was Isabella. who could even kick her biological father Indigo out of the house, and the other was Michael, who held the economic lifeline of Evergreen City. The crowd quickly dispersed.

Soon, only Michael and Isabella were left.

Isabella was about to leave but was pulled onto Michael's car. The person who had swapped cars with him, recognizing him, felt the keys burning in his hand.


His family couIdn't afford to offend the Brown Family. He wouldn't dare take Michael's things no matter what.


"If I hadn't come over, how long were you planning to keep this from me,Isabella? How many things have you not told me the truth about?"Michael questioned her, his gaze sharp.

They were almost chest to chest, and Isabella felt suffocated by Michael's oppressive presence.


Feeling uneasy, she frowned and pushed him away hard.

Michael grunted, clutching his chest, his face turning pale.


When he had rolled with Isabella into the grass, she hadn't been hurt at all in his arms, but he had hit a rock.


Now,it was starting to hurt.

"Where are you hurt?" Isabella immediately noticed his discomfort and reached out in concern.


Michael grabbed her hand, placing it on his chest, his voice hoarse,"What
do you think? You broke my heart, and now you want to go?"

Isabella was speechless.


She quickly shook him off. For him to say something so disgusting at this moment, it seemed he hadn't hurt his brain.


But the situation had been too critical just now. If he really was injured,she couldn't just ignore it. "You took a hard fall just now. You should go to the hospital. I'll cover all the medical expenses!"


After saying this, Isabella put her helmet back on, swung her long legs over the bike, and left swiftly.


Michael hadn't expected her to just leave like that.


What if he was really too injured to move? When had she become so heartless?


Back then, even a minor cold would have her staying up all night by his side,taking care of him, giving him water and medicine.

In the vast racetrack,only Michael was left.


The sky had completely darkened, and the cold wind blew, giving a sense of desolation.


He felt a pang of regret.


In three years, why hadn't he realized her worth from the beginning, and instead praised Bianca's understanding and gentleness in front of her?


The way Isabella felt back then was exactly how he felt now.

It was the punishment he deserved.
###Chapter 60 Win Isabella Back Yourself

On the way back, the radio in Michael's car broadcasted news about Isabella.

Many netizens were calling out to Michael, telling him to stop bothering Isabella,saying she deserved better.

They urged them to get a divorce and let her be free.

As Michael listened, he felt upset, and he turned off the radio.

Back then, he was blinded, failing to recognize her goodness and taking everything she did for granted.

He even subconsciously thought she was using him as a tool to secure her position when she suggested having a child with him.

He never realized that Isabella owed him nothing.

He agreed the marriage at the very beginning. and having children was a natural part of being a couple.


Why did it take him so long to realize?

Back at the Brown Villa, Stella was sitting on the couch watching the latest news online, which happened to be a report about Isabella being a racing queen.

Seeing Isabella's flamboyant and beautiful faceafter she took off her helmet.Stella gritted her teeth in anger.

In a flash, she saw Michael's figure.

She seized the opportunity and held her phone up to Michael,"Michael,
look at these news reports. Isabella has been deceiving us for three years.pretending to be harmless. And now, before you two are even divorced.she can't wait to reveal her true colors. What racing goddess? She's just flaunting her body in public. Look at what she's wearing.What decent woman would dress like that and stand among men? She's completely disgraced our Brown Family!"

Stella's voice grew sharper, and her words became increasingly harsh.


Michael's face turned completely dark.

His voice was icy, "Mom, that's enough. Isabella is my wife. Please show her respect! And as for the things you've done to Isabella, just because I haven't pursued them doesn't mean I've let them go."

Hearing Michael bring up that matter again, Stella's voice grew even more defensive. "What nonsense are you talking about? I'm your mother.Everything I've done is for your own good. Are you1 really going to go against me for Isabella?"

Michael walked to the stairs, turned sideways, and gave her a cold look, "If you are not my mother, do you think I would tolerate your actions even once?”


There was a hint of impatience in Michael's eyes.

Even a tiny bit was enough to make Stella feel unbearable.


She was Michael's biological mother, the one who gave birth to and raised him!


She would never allow any woman to hold a higher place in Michael's heart than she did. "Did that bitch Isabella say something to you? It's because of her that you've become like this! Isabella, that bitch, I won't let
her off."

Stella was both angry and hateful, her face twisted.

There was no trace of the noble lady she once was.

Michael narrowed his eyes. "Even now, you still don't realize where you went wrong?"


Stella's eyes widened, "I did nothing wrong. It's her. She shouldn't have married into this family. Michael. I'm your mother. How can you talk to me like this?"


Michael couldn't be bothered to argue with her anymore, "Until you apologize to Isabella, your bank card will be indefinitely suspended.And don't let me see you associating with Bianca's family again."

With that, he returned to his room.


Downstairs, Stella, hearing that Michael was going to suspend her bank card and that she had to apologize to Isabella in person,smashed everything she could in a fit of rage.

It took a while for her to calm down.

Upstairs, Michael took a shower in his room and checked his injuries in the mirror. There was a bruise on his back.


He took some anti-inflammatory medicine and went to Aiden's place.

Isabella wouldn't be coming back tonight, and he wondered if Aiden would throw a fit when he found out.

Outside, Sophia had just left with a tray and greeted Michael, "Mr. Brown."
Seeing that a third of the food on the tray was gone. Michael was a bit surprised.

He pushed open the door to find Aiden holding a tablet, watching the news with a smile of pride.

It was news about Isabella.


Judging by Aiden's expression, he didn't seem surprised or shocked by it;rather, it was as if he had known all along.


Michael narrowed his eyes and walked closer. "Grandpa, did you know Isabella could race?"


Hearing Michael's voice. Aiden didn't even look up, just snorted, "She's your wife. If you didn't know, how would I? I just saw it on the news."


Michael didn't respond.

He clearly didn't believe it.

Aiden wasn't in a hurry. He was very happy watching Isabella on the news,but when he looked at Michael, his smile disappeared. "Isabella is excellent in every way. I don't know how she ended up with you. You don't know how good your wife is until you're abandoned. Then you realize what you've lost, and it's too late."

Michael felt uncomfortable all over and couldn't care about his pride anymore, "Grandpa, I know I was wrong. Please help me one more time.Does Isabella have any other secrets she's hiding from me?"

Aiden ignored him. He had helped Michael so many times,but did Michael ever take it seriously?
Only by letting him experience it himself would he understand Isabella's worth.

"Don't ask me. I don't know anything. If you truly realize your mistake.you should win Isabella back yourself, just like she once did for you."Thinking about how Isabella had been driven away by Michael. Aiden got angry. "Also, the Brown Group will hold a general shareholders'meeting tomorrow.You will preside over it. and Isabella will attend."

Michael frowned, "What is she attending the Brown Group's shareholders'meeting for?"


Aiden glared at him, "What do you think? Of course, it's to transfer the Brown Group's shares to Isabella. You're presiding so you can see it with your own eyes."

Aiden thought, 'You can't even have a child, so how do you expect to hold onto the position of heir?

Michael's expression changed.


He knew Aiden liked Isabella a lot, but transferring shares was no small matter. Aiden didn't even discuss it with him and wanted to transfer everything to Isabella.

It sounded a bit too hasty.


But he knew Aiden's character. Once Aiden said something, he wouldn't take it back. Michael could only return to his room in frustration.


Closing the door, he called his assistant, Aaron. "Did you find out anything about Mrs. Brown in recent years?"

Receiving a call from Michael late at night was nerve-wracking enough,
and hearing Michael's question made Aaron break out in a cold sweat.

He couldn't possibly say that he had found nothing useful.

Although Michael had given him a short time, with the Brown Group's influence,they should have found something by now.


But Isabella's identity was like a mystery. No matter how hard they tried,there were no clues.


He even looked into the Taylor Family, but the result was the same.

All information about Isabella stopped at the age of seven.
###Chapter 61 Investigating the Identity of the Gambling King

After that, Isabella was taken to the countryside by Daniel.

But the village had long been abandoned, with only dilapidated houses left.
Apart from the bare walls, there was nothing left.

No matter how capable Aaron was, it was impossible to find any traces in a bunch of empty houses.


But when faced with Michael's questioning, he couldn't really say he found nothing, or his career would be over.

"I found something. Mrs. Brown's identityis that of a mysterious race car driver. The recent hot news online is all about Mrs. Brown." Aaron had no other choice but to stall for time.

There was a moment of silence on the other end of the phone.

It was obvious that Michael already knew about this.


"I already know that. Continue to intensify the investigation," Michael said.clearly angry.

"Understood, Mr. Brown!" Aaron quickly responded, "I'll immediately assign more people."

"Wait!" Michael exhaled deeply. For some reason, he had a nagging feeling.

Isabella might really be connected to the Wilson Family!

Not because of Thomas, but because in Evergreen City, the fact that they couldn't find any information about Isabella itself indicated a problem.
Moreover, the place Isabella went to back then was in the eastern part of Valoria.


And the eastern part of Valoria was the Wilson Family's sphere of influence.

Besides the Wilson Family, he couldn't think of anyone else who had the ability to erase all of Isabella's past.


Even if the Brown Family intervened, they wouldn't be able to find a single trace.


Or perhaps, she had always been by his side.

He just hadn't noticed her other identity.


"Mr. Brown?" Not hearing anything for a long time, Aaron thought Michael wasn't talking to him earlier.

"Find a photo of Solterra Gambling King Mr. Wilson, from any period.and send it to me." Michael ordered in a deep voice.

Aaron, on the other end of the phone, was so scared he almost stuttered,"Mr. Brown, you don't mean... the Gambling King Mr. Wilson who was undefeated at the Golden Nexus twenty years ago?"


"Yes, him. Find the photo; I need it." Michael said.

Aaron wiped his sweat. He didn't know what was going on with Michael lately; the tasks he assigned were getting more and more difficult.

Now Michael was even looking for someone like the Gambling King.

But where was he supposed to find it?
The Gambling King's real name was Daniel Wilson.

He was also Aaron's childhood ido.and Aaron had even collected various legendary stories about him.


There were quite a few movies based on him back then.

Aaron had only seen some of his personal stories in old newspapers.which even had a photo attached. But the photography technology back then couldn't make high-definition photos.

It was said that he was a stunningly handsome man in his youth.Because of his exceptional abilities, courage, and vision, he caught the eye of a local overlord and married the overlord's daughter.

After that, Daniel took over the overlord's business and gradually rose to his current position.

But Daniel had stepped down twenty years ago and had never appeared again.

Investigating Daniel was very difficult.

Aaron wouldn't be able to sleep tonight.

The next morning.

Michael parked his car in front of the garden villa where Isabella was currently living.


Strangely enough, when Bianca's family lived here, he had never visited once.

But now, looking at this historically rich house, all he could think of were images of Isabella and Grace.
Isabela's mother. Grace, was a gentle-looking, elegant woman.

Isabella's personality was the exact opposite.

She had a fiery temper.

Isabella might not even remember that he had once lived nearby for a while.


Back then, before Bianca appeared, they went to school together, fed cats in the alley, and Isabella even gave him a cat-head doll.

He took her to the river to catch small fish.


Their laughter used to echo in every corner of this area. But why had they come to this point now?


Like familiar strangers, knowing each other well yet separated by an insurmountable barrier.


Inside the house. Isabella had gotten up early.

She received a call from Aiden, asking her to go to the Brown Group today.

Aiden said there was something important to discuss with her.

Isabella guessed it was about the shares. She had secretly missed the appointment with Aiden's lawyer yesterday, and today she couldn't escape Aiden's direct order.


She had to go.

If Michael agreed to divorce her and let her give up her inheritance of the Brown Group, it wouldn't be a bad thing for her.
Thinking of this, Isabella put on beautiful makeup and stepped out in high heels.


As soon as she walked out the door, she saw the conspicuous black sports car parked grandly at the entrance.


Isabella knew who it was.

She was about to pretend she didn't see it and turn away.

Michael stuck his head out of the car window, revealing a handsome face."Aren't you going to the Brown Group? Come on, I'll give you a ride!"

Isabella gritted her teeth and took a deep breath. She really didn't want to see him this early in the morning.

She didn't want Michael to ruin her good mood.

She rolled her eyes. "No need, I have my own car!"

Michael raised an eyebrow, glanced at the passersby attracted by his horn,and smirked. "Are you sure you don't need a ride? I just saw quite a few reporters heading this way. You're the legendary racing queen. How long do you think it will take them to reach your doorstep"

"You..." Isabella's face changed before she could finish her sentence.


She quickly opened Michael's car door and got in. "Drive, unless you want to be the center of a big news story. I don't!"


Seeing her swiftly buckle her seatbelt, Michael's eyes curved with satisfaction. He stepped on the gas, and the car sped away from the villa like a flash.


By the time the reporters arrived with their equipment, Michael had
already taken Isabella away from thevilla.

On the road, Isabella looked at Michael, who was sitting very close to her.and the unique scent that occasionally wafted from him.


She coughed uncomfortably. "Let me make it clear. I only got in your car to avoid the reporters."


"Perfect, we can also discuss the divorce agreement." Michael glanced at her slightly reddened ears, feeling inexplicably pleased.

With a faint smile, he said. "Alright. as you wish. The traffic might be heavy at this time, so we can talk as long as you want."

Isabella looked at him as if she had seen a ghost. frowning deeply.

Was this still the Michael she knew?


The divorce terms she had prepared to say were stuck in her throat.Seeing Michael's amicable demeanor. Isabella felt something wvas off.

She decided to keep quiet.

Turning to look out the window, she didn't want to be played by him again.
###Chapter 62 Putting on a Show of Affection

Isabella remained silent throughout the journey.

Finally, they arrived at their destination. Just as she was about to get out of the car. Isabella paused when she saw the surroundings.

Michael had parked the car several dozen feet awway from the entrance.


"Why didn't you park in the underground garage?" Isabella frowned.


Walking from here would be too conspicuous.

She didn't want anyone from the Brown Group to see her getting out of the car with Michael and misunderstand their relationship.

Michael unbuckled his seatbelt. "If we go in, how are we supposed to act like a loving couple?"

Isabella's eyes widened. "Michael, are you crazy? Why should I play along with this act? We're about to get divorced!"

Isabella instinctively wanted to escape.

Before she could open the car door, she was pulled back. Michael reclined the seat and pressed down on her without any courtesy.

In the confined space of the car, Isabella's hands were held by him, and their bodies were tightly pressed together.


This action was too intimate.

Anyone passing by would think their relationship was unusual.


Isabella's breathing became erratic, and she didn't dare to move,fearing
that Michael might actually do something here.

Seeing that resistance was futile, she simply tilted her head and asked,"Just say it, what's your purpose?"

Isabella, lying under him, exuded a faint sweet fragrance and lay quietly without making a fuss, making Michael feel a bit itchy inside.

His throat moved up and down. "I have only one request. When you get out of the car, stay by my side. Don't let anyone in the company notice anything, and by the way, dispel the rumors about our divorce."

Isabella was stunned. She never expected such shameless request.

The divorce had been delayed repeatedly by him until now.

It wasn't actually a rumor.

Now he wanted her to dispel the rumors. She was truly angry.

"Michael, you really have some nerve. Even at this point, you want to maintain your dignity. There's no room for negotiation about the divorce.I don't agree." As Isabella spoke, she tried to push him away,but Michael knew her too well.


He pressed her down and explained, "I told you, it's just an act, for one day.Besides, do you really think the mess you caused didn't affect the company? The stock market has been dropping for days. Can you say you're not responsible?"


Isabella didn't fall for his trick and sneered, "What responsibility?If you had been straightforward about the divorce, none of this would have happened. You're the one managing the company. You can't blame me."
Just as Michael was about to say something, a group of people walked by outside,and his eyes flashed.


He suddenly leaned close to her ear, his low voice sending a tingling sensation through her body. "Someone's coming. What do you think will happen if I roll down the window now? Do you want to try?"

Michael chuckled lowly, with a hint of seduction and intention.

Hearing this, Isabella became both anxious and angry. She knew Michael was capable of doing such a thing and was furious.

She bit him hard.

Michael frowned but didn't let go of her. "Bite all you want. I'll take it as your agreement."


Michael had planned all of this from the moment he appeared at her doorstep.


This was the Brown Group building. Even if he could bring himself to do such shameless things, she couldn't stand being watchedI like a live broadcast.


When they got out of the car, Michael extended his hand to Isabella, his eyes filled with a tenderness that could melt her.


Only Isabella knew how fake he was.


But with so many people watching, she took a deep breath and still took Michael's hand, walkng intimately into the elevator together.

Everyone who saw them was shocked.

Recently, news about Isabella and rumors of their divorce had been all
over the headlines.


No one expected that before they could get any follow-up. Isabella and Michael would appear hand in hand at the company, shattering the hopes of those waiting for Isabella to divorce and find a new husband.


As they watched the elevator doors close, a group of people at the front desk started gossiping.


"What's going on? Aren't they supposed to get divorced? How come they appeared together in the company lobby today?"


"Not just that. Mr. Brown had a smile on his face the whole time. Have any of you ever seen Mr. Brown that happy?"


"Maybe Mr. Brown and Mrs. Brown were just having a spat and aren't really getting divorced?"

"But what about Mrs. Brown and Thomas from the Wilson Family? A lot of people online say they're the real deal!"

"Yeah,and Mr.Brown has been seen getting close to Mrs. Brown's sister,Bianca. There are even intimate photos of them online!"


"That's why rich people live in a different world from us. It's so messy."


"Stop it. Last time somebody badmouthed Mrs. Brown and got fired. We need to keep our jobs."


Top floor.


In the serious and quiet conference room, Michael and Isabella walked in.

All eyes were on Isabella. Most of the people here were shareholders of the Brown Group, and their gazes were filled with dissatisfaction and scrutiny.
Isabella raised an eyebrow. It seemed these people were unhappy with her.

Good, she didn't like them either.


If she took this opportunity to bring up the divorce. Maybe these people would even help her.

Aiden, sitting at the head of the table, saw Isabella and waved her over to sit next to him.


Isabella letgo of Michael's hand and walked straight to Aiden.

She finally felt relieved after acting all the way here.

"I've made myself clear. You've seen the contract. All my shares will be transferred to Isabella starting today! Isabella, sign it." Aiden smiled and handed her one of the two copies of the contract, his tone as calm as if he were talking about weather.


The people sitting below stared, their faces dark, but no one dared to voice any objections.


After all, Aiden was transferring his personal shares within the group.which didn't affect the group's overall interests. Even so, the amount was significant.


But the Brown Group had flourished under Aiden's leadership.

In the Brown Group, Aiden's words carried a lot of weight.

His decision was not something the shareholders could stop.

The contract had been drafted by Aiden's lawyer long ago. He was here just to inform them and back Isabella up, not to negotiate with them.
Isabella opened the contract and her pupils contracted.

Fifty-five percent of the shares!

Aiden hadn't kept any for himself. He was handing over his life's work to her.


And twenty percent of those shares belongedI to Michael.

If she signed this, she would have decision-making power in the Brown Group.


To put it bluntly, Michael would be working for her.

But how was that possible?

How could Michael agree to this?
###Chapter 63 Michael's Deep Schemes

Isabella instinctively looked at Michael beside her, her eyes filled with immense shock.


But Michael remained calm; he was clearly aware of this contract.

Isabella was even more confused.

She knew how much Michael cared about this heir position.

For the past three years, he had devoted almost all his time to work to secure his position as the CEO, which was why Aiden was satisfied to hand over the group to him.

But now, he didn't say a word.

"Isabella, just sign it after you read it." Aiden urged her, and the assistant behind him handed over a pen.

"Grandpa, no. I can't sign this contract!" Isabella decisively refused.


Aiden had mentioned this to her before, but she thought it was just a joke to annoy Michael.

At thattime, she was heartbroken and agreed casuallyjust to make Michael uncomfortable.


But now, to accept half of the Brown Group's interests, she couldn't do it.

That would be too selfish, and it would betray Aiden's trust.

Because she was still going to divorce Michael.

Aiden smiled, "Isabella, this is my gift to you. Just consider it a small
present, don't stress too much about it."


Isabella wanted to explain, but Aiden shook his head, "There's nothing wrong with it. If it weren't for you when I fell ill on the street. I would have died long ago. You've been wronged in the Brown Family all these years;consider this my compensation, okay? Signing this contract doesn't mean you have to manage the entire group. You just sit at home and collect money. If there's anything at the company, let Michael handle it.You can come and inspect from time to time."


Aiden's words made Isabella even more confused.

Aiden said. "Don't think too much, just sign it."

Michael's body was close to hers, and he whispered in her ear, "Grandpa already convinced them before we came. If you don't sign now, you're questioning his authority, which will make him lose face."

Isabella felt a sense of helplessness, and for a moment, she didn't know what to do.


Her mind went blank.


So much so that she was dazed about what happened next and how the meeting ended quickly.


After Aiden left, Michael took her to his office.

As the door closed, Isabella became more alert and shook off his hand,"
Michael, why did you say those things to me? Why didn't you stop it?"


She didn't understand why Michael transferred his shares to her too.

He was the heir tothe Brown Group.
In their three years of marriage. she had seen him fight step by step to secure this position.

What did he want exactly?


"Why should I stop it?" Michael looked at her quietly, stepping closer."You want to divorce me and take half of my assets. Now I'm giving you everything, including my status and wealth. Do you still think I don't care about you? Do you still want to divorce me?"

He held her shoulders and asked her calmly.


Isabella's heart trembled, and she bit her lip hard, "You mean you knew the contents of this contract all along. and this is just a trap!"

Isabella thought. 'Michael, to avoid divorce, you even used the group's interests, which you value most, as part of your plan.'

Michael didn't deny it; he indeed knew Aiden's intentions and didn't oppose them. "This is the best way. You'll have everything you want,nothing will change, and you can continue being Mrs. Brown."


She felt uneasy because everything in the Brown Family had nothing to do with her.


Now he was giving her everything in the Brown Group, including himself.From now on, half of the Brown Group's money would flow into her exclusive account.


There was no greater sense of security than this.

"Michael, don't impose your thoughts on me. I'm not you; I don't need these things, and I'm not interested in the Brown Group's assets." Isabella was furious. When had she ever said she wanted anything from the
Brown Group?

All she wanted was the half of the assets he should give her. "Don't think I don't know what you're up to. If I sign this contract, it will become your best defense in the divorce. Not only will I not get any compensation.but everyone will say I coveted the Brown Family's assets."

There was no such good thing in this world.


Especially when it came to Michael.

Isabella slowly realized and saw through Michael's true intentions.

Michael was scheming, and his methods were endless.


She would never believe he would do something like giving away his money.

"In your heart, am I really that kind of person?" Michael's face darkened.and his chest heaved with anger at Isabella's baseless accusations.


He yanked off his tie and threw it on the sofa, "No matter what you think.as long as I don't agree, you can forget about getting a divorce!"


"Michael, who do you think you are? I will divorce you no matter what.Just wait and see!" Isabella raised her voice.


Michael still wanted to use such shameless tactics to trap her. No way.

Isabella threw the contract she had been clutching all the way at him and strode out.


Michael grabbed Isabella from behind, threw her onto the sofa, and took off his suit jacket,pressing down on her.
Fortunately, the door was tightly closed; otherwise,it would have caused quite a stir if people outside saw it.

"Isabella, what are you fussing about? You want money. I'll give it to you.I'm giving you myself too. What more do you want?" Michael frowned,his deep eyes reflectingIsabella's struggling and angry face.

"Let go." Isabella looked up and met Michael's eyes. For the first time,she saw a rare emotion in his eyes.


It was confusion and reluctance.

She struggled even more, as if she couldn't wait to escape from Michae1."Michael, you promised that as long as I cooperated with the act,you wouldn't go too far."


She didn't dare to look at him again. Michael was the man she had loved for over ten years. The emotions in his eyes were what she had longed for all these years.

But she had been deceived by him for three years. She couldn't let herself be swayed by a reluctant look from Michael.

She had already given up on him.

She saw clearly what kind of person he was.

She shouldn't let herself be deceived again, nor did she want to be hurt again.

Michael's gaze was intense. Ignoring her resistance, he leaned down and kissed her.

His lips gently pressed against hers, a light touch that calmed her emotions.
Finally, he rested his forehead against hers, and gently embraced her.letting out a low sigh. "Isabella."

At that moment, something seemed to crack in her heart.
###Chapter 64 She Did It on Purpose, But He Li ked lt

"Michael." Bianca heard that the Brown Group was holding a shareholders'meeting today, and even Aiden was attending. She rushed over. only to witness the tender scene before her eyes.


Michael possessively held Isabella in his arms, shielding her from view.which deeply provoked Bianca.

Ever since Isabella kicked her out. Bianca had been trying every possible way to deliver a fatal blow to Isabella.

But she never expected that Isabella, a country girl. would turn out to be the recent online sensation, the racing queen.

One race changed everyone's perception of Isabella, and they even started to like her.

The dirt she had paid netizens to dig up was buried.

Instead,it created a buzz for Isabella, and everyone began to sympathize with her tragic background.

She had endured several days at home, fearing that any photos taken of her would spark negative public opinion. If it weren't for Stella's call about the stock transfer, she wouldn't come out.

She hadn't even finished listening before rushing over, but she was still a step too late.

The meeting was over, and she witnessed Michael and Isabella's intimate embrace with her own eyes.
She cursed in her head. "That bitch, Isabella. Why does everything I wants end up in Isabella's hands? The position of Mrs. Brown, Michael,and even Aiden's favor-all of these should have been mine. Isabella, who has been kicked out of the house. dared to compete with me. Grace couldn't beat Harper. and Isabella couldn't beat me either.

But she couldn't show it in front of Michael.

Even though she was seething with anger, she had to pretend she accidentally walked in. "Michael. Isabella. what are you doing? This is the company!"

She acted as if she couldn't stand it, hoping to embarrass Isabella,who would leave in a fit of anger.


But she was met with a contemptuous snort. "Are you blind?Can't you see what we're doing?"

Seeing Michael straighten up. Isabella instead wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him down and biting his neck. leaving a noticeable mark on his jawline.

That spot made it obvious what had happened.

Seeing Isabella being so forward, even though it hurt a bit. Michael's mood improved significantly. He sat up and pulled her close to him.

"Isabella, this is the company, and it's broad daylight. Don't you have any shame?" Bianca's face turned pale with anger,and she started cursing.


Ever since Isabella kicked her family out of Garden Villa. Bianca had stopped pretending.

"I think the shameless one here is you," Isabella retorted1."You knew this
was Michael's office. yet you barged in without knocking, interrupting us.and you have the nerve to stand there watching. So. you're the most shameless one here."

Bianca's face turned pale. She had always presented herself as gentle and understanding in front of Michael.

Moreover. Michael hadn't divorced Isabella yet, so cursing Isabella wouldn't do her any good.

She shifted her gaze to Michael,seeking help.

Her eyes were full of grievance. "Michael. I came here because I have something important to discuss with you. Can we talk alone?"

Hearing this, Isabella raised an eyebrow and stood up. Just when Bianca thought she was leaving out of self-awareness, Isabella merely adjusted her clothes.


She gave Bianca a provocative look.

Then she extended her hand to Michael on the couch, coquettishly saying."Michael, I want to sit in your chair. Can you carry me over?"

This was the first time Isabella had spoken to him in such a tone. Her playful and cute demeanor made Michael's heart flutter.


He remained expressionless, grabbed her hand, and pulled her into his arms. He carried her to the desk and placed her in the leather chair, which was his office chair.


Isabella sat there as if it were her rightful place,and Michael stood beside her indulgently.
She looked up at the dumbfounded Bianca, as if watching a joke.

"Didn't you have something to say? Go ahead. I'm curious to hear what important matter it is. If you insist on speaking to Michael alone. I won't insist on staying, but..." She turned to Michael, her eyes filled with flirtation. "Michael, you wouldn't want to leave me here alone. would you?"

Michael didn't deny it.

He knew she was doing it on purpose, but he liked it.

But Bianca. who was beingtreated as invisible, was so angry she could almost spit blood.

"Bianca, just say what you have to say!" Michael finally spoke. His eyes.once filled with tolerance for Bianca, were now cold and indifferent.just like with any other person.

The way Harper and her daughter had treated Isabella had exhausted his patience.

"Michael. I came here to discuss a business matter,not a personal one. Can't we talk alone?" Bianca bit her lip, looking at Michael with a fragile expression.

She thought to herself. Clearly, I am the one who truly love him. Why couldn't he understand? Isabella only has a marriage contract that no one recognizes. Howv could she take him away?'

"If it's a business matter, you should discuss it in front of Isabell Michael's tone was firm. with a hint of pride. "Half of the Brown Group's shares have been transferred to Isabella. Her shares now exceed mine and my grandfather's. Even I have to listen to her in the company."
Bianca didn't believe it at all.

Even if Aiden favored Isabella, he wouldn't transfer all the shares to her.

Even if he did, it would be a small amount. just for show.

No one in their right mind would hand over the family assets. especially with Michael, the heir of the Brown Group, still around.

Maybe he was just going along with Isabella.

Bianca felt a deep resentment. "Michael, have you forgotten? We grew up together. When we were kids. you even caught little goldfish for me in the river and gave me your favorite cat pendant."

Bianca deliberately mentioned their childhood, hoping Michael would remember who he truly loved.

There was a time when Michael had shown her some warmth.

After Isabella was taken away, Bianca was brought to the Taylor Family and met Michael, who waited at the gate every day.

The following years were spent with Michael at the same school.

At that time, she knew that the person Michael was waiting for was Isabella.Only when she mentioned Isabella would Michael talk to her.

"Cat pendant?"

"Cat pendant?" Isabella frowned at Michael. She seemed to have some memory of having such an item when she was a child.

Michael explained, his face darkening. "That thing wasn't a gift from me.You took it without my permission."
###Chapter 65 Did You Have Fun?

Upon hearing this explanation. Isabella reluctantly nodded.

In the office. only she was seated, occupying the main office chair.She stared at Bianca in front of her with a scrutinizing gaze.

Bianca didn't care about her look; what mattered to her were Michael's words.


Over the years, she had learned some unreasonable tactics from Harper.Even in unfavorable situations. she could use her words to fight for a chance.


She continued talking about her childhood, "Then. you saved me in the alley and chased away those who bullied me. Are these things also false?"

Isabella squinted her eyes and glanced at Michael beside her.

Realizing he had saved Bianca before, she had really underestimated him.

Michael felt Isabella's judgmental gaze and looked at the frail Bianca.feeling somewhat awkward. "You misunderstood. I was just passing by that time. and you blocked my way home."

"But you did save me. Are you not even willing to admit that?" Bianca was on the verge of tears.


Michael was speechless. He cleared his throat. "I intervened because those people were my subordinates. They usually collected protection fees for me.I couldn't just watch them bully someone,so I had to pull them aside and teach them a lesson."

This time, not only Bianca but even Isabella was stunned.
This was the Michael they had admired for over a decade, a person revered as a role model by the outside world.

As a child. he led a group of kids to collect protection fees. Did the Brown Family lack that bit of money?

Isabella really wanted to know why she had loved Michael so much back then.


"But..."

Bianca wanted to say something more but was promptly stopped by Isabella.


"Shut up!"

She couldn't listen to it anymore.

If this continued, she wasn't sure if the two were really lovers, but she couldn't hear any more about Michael's past.

She could hardly look directly at the tall and cold Michael in front of her.

"Whether it's work or personal matters, I don't want to hear it anymore.Either you leave now, or I'll have someone escort you out!" As Isabella spoke, she had already pressed the intercom, "Security, send two people to escort Ms. Taylor out of the company."

Bianca looked at Isabella in disbelief, sitting in Michael's chair and using his authority.

Seeing Bianca not moving with her blush face, Isabella didn't forget to add one last sentence, "One more thing, from today on, your cooperation with the Brown Group is over. There will be no renewal, and all your current
endorsements are canceled. You no longer have the right to step into the Brown Group for work. Do you understand?"


Isabella squinted her eyes slightly, hitting the key points with a calm demeanor.


She seemed indifferent to everything, but she kept everything in her heart.


Michael lowered his eyes. taking in her every move. Isabella always managed to surprise him unexpectedly.

Every aspect of her hada deadly attraction to him.

Bianca, who used to enter the CEO's office without any hindrance,was now kicked out of the Brown Group.

From today on, she wasn't allowed to enter the company without an appointment.

The company's internal staff only learned today that Bianca was the one pretending to be the hostess of the Brown Group.

Every time she brought breakfast to the company,everyone greeted her respectfully.not expecting Isabella to expose her so quickly.

Bianca was thrown out like trash, utterly humiliated.

The gossiping voices followed her all the way. The moment she walked out of the building. Bianca's face turned blush with shame.

She randomly hailed a cab and cried all the way back to the apartment Michael had given her family.


In the small living room, Indigo and Harper were arguing fiercely about the villa they used to live in.
Harper, hands on her hips, cursed Indigo for being stupid, questioning why he didn't secure the house in his name after Grace died.


Now, she was used to living the life of a wealthy lady, and in her old age.she was looked down upon.

The house they lived in now wasn't bad, but compared to the Garden Villa.it was far inferior.


Her status had significantly dropped.

Harper.who had risen from the bottom. cursed with the most unpleasant words.

Indigo,afraid of Harper, wanted to curse back but didn't dare.

Marrying Harper was the biggest punishment of his life.

In his youth, he had been sincere, with Grace, who was an elegant andgenerous woman.

But men were like that; facing the same type of woman for a long time.they inevitably succumbed to temptation.

At that time, he thought that since Isabella had been kicked out, it didn't matter whose name was on the house; it was stll his.


Now, he only regretted not being more ruthless, wishing Grace and Isabella had both died, saving him from all the subsequent troubles.


If Isabella were dead, Bianca would have married into the Brown Family by now.

He would have more money than he could spend in a lifetime.
Seeing Bianca return with red eyes. Harper lovingly fetched some ice.

Listening to Bianca recount what had happened at the Brown Group.Harper's hands trembled with anger. "It's that bitch Isabella again. Why didn't she die back then?"


She then comforted Bianca. "Bianca, don't cry. Don't worry. I have a way to deal with Isabella. Just wait and see."

"Mom. do you really have a way to deal with Isabella?" Bianca stopped crying, her eyes filled with intense hatred.

"Of course. Grace wasn't my match. How arrogant can Isabella be? I will definitely avenge you."


At the CEO's office. Michael looked down at Isabella, who was flipping through the contracts on his desk with interest, her body leaning against the desk,long legs crossed.

"Did you have fun?" His voice was low and magnetic.

Hearing this. Isabella pushed the chair back a step with her long legs.looking at him with a raised chin. "Not bad. Maybe being a major shareholder of the Brown Group isn't so bad."

"Is being a major shareholder the only good thing?" Michael gazed at her.raising an eyebrow, clearly implying something.

Isabella pretended not to understand. "What else is there?"


Michael hooked the chair with his long leg, pulling her back in front of him. "There's also me."


With that, he pressed the back of the chair, lowering his head to kiss her,
his eyes filled with uncontrollable desire.

"Stop it. what are you trying to do again?" Isabella panicked. Michael had
been acting like he was in heat lately, kissing her at every turn.

Michael chuackled, determined to have her. "Why hide? Who was the one seducing me just now? Now you want to back out? Too late."


As Michael's handsome and devilish face got closer. Isabella's breath tightened.

At that moment. the ringing of her phone saved her.
###Chapter 66 Intense Scolding

Michael didn't take the phone call seriously at all and immediately kissed Isabella.


His domineering presence invaded her mouth completely.

If Isabella hadn't pushed him away forcefully. she might have been swallowed whole by him.

Isabella was surprised when she saw the call was from Indigo.

To prevent Michael from acting out again, she decisively answered. "What do you want?"

"You bastard, is that how you talk to me? Get your ass to Willow Creek Estates and apologize to Bianca" As soon as Indigo got on the line.he started cursing at Isabella.

His shrill voice was painful to the ears.

Isabella put the phone on the table to avoid dirtying her ears."My dad's long dead. Who do you think you are. ordering me around? Have you forgotten we cut ties when I moved out?"

The day she left the Taylor Family at seven years old, she had completely severed all familial ties with Indigo in her heart.

If Daniel hadn't found her, she would have been tortured to death by Harper and Bianca.

"You bitch, I'm your father. You think you can just cut ties like that? How dare you curse me? You're ungrateful and will be punished!" Indigo was even more furious when he heard Isabella dare to curse him.
"What a joke. People like you. who newver do anything good, live just fine.What do I have to be afraid of? If anyone's going to die. it'lt be you. the one who cheated during marriage! Don't call me again. Hearing your voice makes me sick. You relied on women when you were young and now rely on pleasing others as you age. It's embarrassing. You're a useless man who Il end up being coddled by a woman till the end." Isabella fired back without even pausing for breath.

Michael. listening on the side. was impressed by Isabella's sharp tongue.She didn't even flinch while cursing Indigo.


Thinking back. it seemed like the insults Isabella had thrown at him before were mild in comparison.


He didn't know much about Indigo.

But he had heard some things about the Taylor Family.

When Isabellai's mother. Grace, passed away, Harper brought Bianca into the Taylor Family the very next day.

Since then. Isabella hadn't had a full meal, and her clothes were no longer as nice. often showing signs of being torn.


At that time. Michael was strictly controlled by Aiden regarding money and had very little. Coincidentally, someone wanted him to be the leader of that area to protect them from outsiders.


That was how the "protection fee" came about. He had planned to use the money to buy Isabella a nice outfit, gloves, and a hat, but the next day.Isabella was gone.


When he went to wait for her outside, Bianca told him Isabella had gone to the countryside and wouldn't be coming back.
Michael didn't know much beyond that, but Indigo's attitude towards Isabella made i clear he was far from a good father.


When Indigo approached him for investment funds, he used Isabella's name.


At the time. Michael thought Isabella liked talking to Aiden so much because she longed for family affection, which moved him to help Indigo that one time.


"Isabella. let me tell you, don't think Grace's death was my fault. She was shameless and got sick with an incurable disease. She brought it on herself!"Irritated by Isabela's words. Indigo yelled hysterically into the phone

Isabella was so speechless that sneered. "Indigo, if you hadn't been keeping a mistress behind my mom's back, she wouldn't have gotten sick from anger. My mom's death was caused by you and Harper!"

Thinking of that scene from years ago, Isabella wished they were dead.

"Don't talk nonsense. Grace's death had nothing to do with me.She cheated first and was caught by me. She died of shame." Indigo seemed proud of this. "So what if I kept a mistress? Grace drove me to it.Who knows if she was fooling around outside and got sick? She deserved to die!"


"Indigo. stop slandering my mom. You cheated and still make excuses.Why don't you say Bianca appeared out of thin air? She's only a year younger than me. By your logic, she's someone else's child!"

The two of them were arguing fiercely over the phone.

"Isabella, it doesn't matter what you say. The fact is, if you hadn't married into the Brown Family, it would have been Bianca. I'm wvarning you,you'
d better divorce Michael and clear up Bianca's situation online. Otherwise.Ill reveal aII of Grace's past online. Don't you have a grandfather. Daniel?If you don't listen to me. TIl have someone kill him." Indigo threatened."Daniel is just an old man from the countryside. I might not even need to do much. Just mentioning Grace might be enough to make him die of a heart attack."


"Indigo, don't go too far!" Isabella's eyes narrowed in anger. Indigo.who had been a coward all his life. was now standing up for Bianca.

He even dared to threaten Daniel. If Indigo knew Daniel's true identity.one look from Daniel would have his subordinates throw Indigo into the sea to feed the fish.

"You better wait at home. You want to threaten me? I'll come to you right now and see what evidence you have." Isabella hung up.

She got up to leave. but Michael grabbed his coat and followed her.

"What are you doing?" Isabella frowned. "Regretting making me sign those papers?"

Michael took her hand. "I'm going with you."

Indigo's family consisted of three people, all unreasonable and aggressive.He didn't want Isabella to suffer.

"This is my business. Why are you coming?" Isabella shook off his hand decisively. "Don't follow me."

Michael was persistent, but Isabela glared at him. "Take one more step.and I'll have divorce papers sent to you. Try me?"

Hearing that, Michael Jell silent.
Isabella had found his weak spot and kept using divorce to threaten him.

But he really didn't want to hear that from her again.

He obediently stood still.

"Then Tll wait for your call. Contact me if you need anything." Michael's tone was considerate and gentle.


But Isabella didn't even glance at him. She waved her hand and walked out the door.


She was going to confront Indigo's family, bringing Michael along would be ridiculous.


If hedeveloped feelings for Bianca and sided with them, she would feel extremely disgusted.

Isabella took Michael's car keys. got into his sports car parked outside, and sped off towards Willow Creek Estates where Indigo's family lived.
###Chapter 67 Asking for Shares

When she arrived. Isabella opened the door directly. The three was in the living room discussing how to deal with her.

She sneered after hearing them.

She walked straight over, sat on the couch opposite them. and glanced at the three people in front of her with a mocking look. "Go ahead. what have you come up with? Just bring it on."

Seeing Isabella really come alone, the three of them were stunned.

"Who let you in directly?" Harper wvas the first to react. "Wait. how do you have the key to my house? This is illegal entry. I'm calling the cop!"

Harper could hold a grudge for a lifetime for being kicked out of the villa by Isabella.


"Then call them. I'm not stopping you." Isabella crossed her arms and lifted her chin. "This house was bought by Michael a couple of years ago.and I helped pick it out. It's our marital property. Even if he wanted to give it away, he couldn't decide that on his own. As for the proof.you must have the contract materials for this house, right?"

"What contract? Weren't you there when Michael said it? What nonsense are you talking about?" Harper's eyes widened in shock.

The house was indeed given by Michael, but he never sent any corresponding agreement afterward.

"Without a transfer agreement, aren't you the ones illegally occupying this house? After all, as the owner of the house, I never agreed to let you live here." Isabella smirked coldly.
Looking at this family of idiots, she felt very speechless

"You." Hatper was about to curse but was stopped by a look fromIndigo.

He looked at Isabella. "I heard you got shares in the Brown Group.You dared to hide such a big thing from us. Don't forget. we are your birth parents. Blood ties can't be cut off. Bianca just told me a lot. and I've decided to forgive you this time. From now on. we are still a family."

Isabella remained silent.

Indigo continued. "But as a child.you should give us half of the shares you have as a sign of respect for your mother and me. And you should also give a portion to Bianca to help her career growv. We are a family;we won't treat you unfairly."

Indigo spoke earnestly, as if he wasn't asking Isabella for money. It was as if these things were rightfully his.

"That's right. If you do all this, the Taylor Family will still acknowledge you." Harper acted extremely magnanimous.

Bianca,sitting beside them. said nothing,but her eyes clearly showed she wanted all of this.

After all, those were shares in the Brown Group. Having them would mean being tied to Michael forever. She wouldn't need an excuse to see him anymore.

Isabella couldn't hold back and laughed out loud."What are you talking?You want me to give you the shares? Stop dreaming. Who's family with you? You don't deserve it?"

"Isabella, don't be ungrateful. If it weren't for us raising you, would you be
alive today?"

Isabella shook her head,still smiling. but it didn't reach her eyes.

Isabella shook her head, still smiling, but it didn't reach her eyes. "You raised me? If you hadn't mentioned it. I might have forgotten! When I was a child.you ordered the servants not to leave me any food. making me go to school hungry. When I came back. I had to clean the house and often got beaten for no reason. I had to scavenge for food and was accused of stealing."

Isabellasneered. her eyes sharp. "Did I ever tell you that reclaiming my mother's house was just the first step? Your retribution is far from over!"

"Isabella, do you really think we aren't prepared?" Bianca, who had been sitting quietly. suddenly threw some photos on the table, looking smug."Here is evidence of Grace cheating with another man. If I post these online.
let's see if you still have the nerve to stay by Michael's side."

"Exactly. A shameless woman like Grace can't raise a good daughter.The Brown Family will kick you out. Only Bianca deserves the title of Mrs.Brown. You, a bumpkin, have no right to this position," Harper said arrogantly.


If she had known Indigo had these photos, she would have had him bring them out earlier. Maybe Bianca would have married into the Brown Family back then.

Isabella ignored them and picked up the photos to take a look.

Although the photos were old. Grace's gentle smile and the tall, handsome man smiling back at her were still recognizable.

It was her uncle, Atticus, who was far away abroad.
So Atticus had found Grace back then.

Unfortunately. even Atticus couldn't make Grace see Indigo's true nature.

But these photos were clearly taken secretly. each one deliberately showing them in intimate angles, and there were so many of them.

Isabella's eyes swept sharply over someone.

Back then. Harper had used these photos to ruin Grace's marriage.

Indigo's baseless suspicions and verbal abuse, along with external rumors.
had caused Grace's already weak body to collapse.

If it weren't for her. Grace wouldn't have ended up like this.

Isabella narrowed her eyres. exuding extreme coldness. She slowly stood up and smiled coldly at the three people in front of her. "You've hidden these for so long. I really underestimated your ambition!"

"Mr. Martin, you can come in now!" The door was pushed open from the outside, and a tall man in a sharp suit walked in. It was the internationally renowned lawyer,Ryan.

He stepped aside to make way for the person behind him. Thomas, with his hands in his pockets, walked over to Isabella.

Thomas, in a black trench coat and sunglasses, exuded an aura that made him look like he was shielding Isabella.

"Isabella, what are you trying to do by bringing people here?" With two men suddenly in the room, both looking formidable. Indigo quickly sensed something was wrong.

Isabella shrugged. "What can I do? I just want to make things clear.Every
word you've said since I walked in has been recorded. Well,and that call you made half an hour ago, threatening to find my grandfather and kill him? I recorded that too. Now all the evidence is here. and so is the lawyer!



"You bitch! How dare you do this to me? I'm your father!" Indigo never expected Isabella to record their conversation.


Those words were said in a fit of anger. If they were used as evidence and something happened to Daniel, he would be the prime suspect.
###Chapter 68 How could you possibly be a Wlson?

Seeing Indigo clutching his chest in anger. Harper quickly helped him sit down.

Bianca reached out to block Indigo and Harper. pointing at Isabella and Thomas as she cursed. "Isabella, don't think I don't know about your relationship with this man. You haven't even divorced Michael yet.and you dare to bring him out like this. Aren't you afraid that Michael will find out and kick you out of the Brown Family?"


"Who gave you the guts to talk about him like that? Then again, what can I expeet from a daughter raised by Indigo? Your whole family probably doesn't even know what proper upbringing is. You're all just a bunch of blood-sucking parasites." Isabella glanced at them coldly.


They could talk about her, but she would never allow anyone to slander Thomas.

Bianca's eyes were red with anger. "Just you wait. I'm going to tell Michael about you and this man right now. He hates betrayal the most. If you dare to cheat, he won't let you off!"

"That's right. Michael should know what they've been doing behind his back. The Brown Family won't tolerate a slut like Isabella." Harper chimed in.

Thomas looked at the family with cold eyes, filled with disgust.

He had received elite education since childhood and had never heard such vulgar and unpleasant words in his family.
Just standing there made him feel like he was soaked in a disgusting odor.making it unbearabole even for a moment.

But just thinking about how Isabella had lived in such a family environment for so long, he could feel her helplessness and sadness as a child.


Fortunately. Daniel had noticed something was wrong in timeand brought Isabella back to the Wilson Family.


If she had been left alone in such a family. Isabella's future might have been ruined by these people.


Realizing she had suffered so much back then, Thomas' eyes darkened as he reached out to wrap his arm around Isabella's shoulder, gently patting her.


No wonder she hadn't mentioned anything about the Taylor Family for so many years.

Isabella felt Thomas's emotions and knew he was feeling sorry for her.

But these people had clearly insulted him too, yet he only cared about her.

Isabella's heart warmed. She turned to look at the three people in front of her. her eyes full of coldness. "You can talk about me, but if I hear you badmouthing my uncle again, I can make you leave right now."

Bianca, holding her phone, froze and looked at Isabella and Thomas in disbelied. "What did you say? He's not your sugar daddy?"

Hearing Isabella reveal his identity. Thomas had no intention of hiding it anymore.
He glanced coldly at them and said in a deep voice. "I am Isabella's uncle.I am from the Wilson Family in theeastern part of Valoria. Isabella is my niece and the most cherished heiress of the Wilson Family. With me around. anyone who dares to bully her can try facing my methods! The Wilson Family may not like to show off, but we are not afraid of trouble.The eastern part of Valoria is our territory. but we have influence in the southern as well. It's up to you to decide."

Thomas' voice was calm but carried a menacing tone.

His words were also highly intimidating.

Ryan, standing nearby, tensed up and instinctively moved aside.

To others. Thomas might seem like a refined gentleman, but those who knew him well understood that it was just a facade.

When Thomas got angry, no one could suppress him.

The man who had carved out a path on Sterling Avenue and founded the first financial group couldn't possibly be easy to deal with.

After a11. Thomas had even brought up the Wilson Family. The only group that could go against the Wilson Family and still be fine was the Brown Group in Evergreen City.

Even if Indigo's family was ignorant, they knew the reputation of the Wilson Group in the eastern part of Valoria. It was an entity that even the Brown Group wouldn't dare to provoke easily.

He couldn't help but thought, 'Isabella is a Wilson? How could that be!


If Isabella was a Wilson, then when he married Grace.who was a daughterof the Wilson Group. But back then, he had only thought Grace
was a college girl pursuing true love.

He had never imagined she had such a powerful background and influence.

The more Indigo thought about it, the more terrified he became. He stood up. trembling."Are you talking about the Wilson Family of the Wilson Group?"

"Yes!" Thomas couldn't be bothered to explain further, his eyes coldly scrutinizing Indigo. this weak and incompetent man. He couldn't understand how the naive Grace had fallen for such a bad man.

Indigo was both bad and useless, and he had even brought outsiders to bully Isabella. A man like Indigo was rotten to the core.

Looking back, it was probably because the Wilson Family had been too protective of Grace.

Daniel had been strict with her. not allowing her to go out or make friends with boys. Her brothers had spoiled her.giving her whatever she wanted.

But they hadn't taught her how to discern good men from bad.

So when she met Indigo, she was deceived by his lies about love.

"Impossible. Grace was just an ordinary person. When we got married.not her single family member showed up. How could she be a Wilson." The more Indigo thought about it, the more terrified he became.

Rather than not believing Grace was a Wilson, he couldn't face the fact that she was.

After all,considering what he had done to Grace and Isabella, if it were
investigated, he couldn't hide anything.

Grace had died just like that. The Wilson Family would never let him off.

"Isabella, do you think we would believe you just because you said a few random words?" Bianca rolled her eyes at Isabella and Thomas. "You dare claim to be from the Wilson Family in the eastern part of Valoria? There are plenty of people with the same last name. If everyone claimed to be related to the Wilson Group, the whole street wouldn't be enough to hold them."

Hearing Bianca's words. Harper immediately reacted and joined in the scolding. "Exactly, you must be crazy for money. How dare you lie about you are the Wilsons? Look at yourselves,coming from the countryside and pretending to be from a wealthy family. Do you even deserveit?”

After alI these years without anyone showing up. Harper wouldn't believe Isabella had any connection to such a wealthy family.

If Isabella was really a Wilson, why didn't she say that before?

Isabella looked at the mother and daughter and couldn't help but laughed."I love seeing you act like you've never seen the world. Just because I'm in a good mood. I'll give you a little lesson."

With that, Isabella took out her phone and called Chris, who was managing the company.

She put the call on speaker.

"Ms. Taylor, is there something you need?" Chris paused his meeting stood up, and walked to a quiet place to answer Isabella's call.

His tone was as respectful and polite as always.
Everyone in the room heard it clearly.
###Chapter 69 Banning Bianca

"Where did you find this actor? They're already performing over the phone? How much did Isabella pay you to grovel like this? It's ridiculous.the lengths people will go to for a role!" Harper couldn't help but speak sarcastically upon hearing the voice.


Chris. on the other end of the line, heard Harper's insults and his expression changed, thinking. 'Who is she to disrespect Isabella like that?Is she looking for trouble?

"Ms. Taylor. where are you? Do you need me to come over right now?"Chris sounded ready to spring into action.

"No need. Chris. I can handle this, but I do need you to take care of something for me." Isabella said calmly.

hearing that.Chris quickly replied. "Ms. Taylor. please go ahead.Whatever it is. I'll do my utmost to assist you."

Isabella knew Chris took her words as orders and chuckled to lighten the mood. "It's nothing major. Do you remember the project spokesperson I asked you to remove, Bianca? I heard the Brown Group helped set up a collaboration with EchoMedia Group. Tell them I don't like Bianca and to cancel the contract. If there are any other collaborations, cancel those too.
Also. look into Indigo's company. He stays home all day, yet his business remains stable. Make sure there's nothing fishy going on. Investigate thoroughly."

"Got it. Ms. Taylor. I'll get back to you soon." Hearing it was just minor tasks. Chris breathed a sigh of relief over the phone.

He had thought Isabella was in serious trouble, especially with Daniel in
the hospital. If something happened to Isabella, he wouldn't be able to face Daniel.

After hanging up. Isabella remained composed.

Bianca sneered. "Isabella, you really know how to act. Getting my endorsement canceled and calling EchoMedia Group? Who do you think you are? EchoMedia Group is a subsidiary of the Brown Group. If you had that kind of power, the entire Brown Group would be at your beck and call."


Indigo was almost convinced by Isabella, but when he heard her claim she could ruin his company with a word, his fear vanished. He thought he had almost been fooled by an act.

He said. "You think you can investigate my company? What a joke!"

Isabella didn't respond, just let out a cold snort, letting Indigo rant.

Thomas sat beside her. legs crossed, eyes closed,resting.

Isabella had already called Chris, so there was nothing more for him to do.

As long as Ryan recorded everything, this family couldn't cause any more trouble.

Indigo hadn't finished speaking when Bianca's phone rang.

EchoMedia Group called, unilaterally canceling their contract with her and informing her there would be no future opportunities for collaboration.

Bianca couldn't get a word in before they hung up.

Immediately after, several entertainment companies she had contacted also called and texted to sever ties with her.
Forget collaboration: they didn't even want to associate with her anymore.

From constant calls to complete silence, it took less than a few minuites.

Bianca was blacklisted in the industry just like that.


"How can they just drop me like that? I'm an award-winning piano prodigy! No. this can't be. My career was just starting, how could it end like this?" Bianca stood there, stunned, muttering to herself while holding her phone.

Next. it was Indigo's turn.

A call from the relevant department informed him to pay the million-dollar tax debt within a week. or his company would be seized.and he would be sent to jail.

Indigo didn't dare disobey. He nodded and begged, his face pale with fear.promising to pay the fine and pleading not to have his company seized.

In the family. only Harper was unemployed. but she wasn't stupid.

Seeing the drastic changes in Indigo and Bianca's expressions, she knew how serious things were.

She recalled Isabella driving them out and the bodyguards she brought.thinking Isabella hired them to scare them at first.

Now it seemed such a display and manpower couldn't be bought with money alone.

Could Isabella really be from the Wilson Family?

Could Isabella really be a Wilson?' The thought made Harper break out in a cold sweat.
"Isabella, let me explain. I truly loved Grace back then. If she hadn't gotten too close to another man. I wouldn't have been so angry and neglected her.It's all Harper's fault for seducing me first. If she hadn't shown me photos of Grace cheating. I wouldn't have looked at her." After hanging up.Indigo didn't dare to speculate anymore.


Suddenly. Indigo knelt before Isabella, crying and begging. "You have to believe me. We were once a happy family. It's all Harper's fault for causing our separation. I regret it. Can you forgive me this once?"

Looking her clothes were almost pulled over. Isabella disdainfully stepped aside.


Just then. Harper lunged at Indigo. cursing and hitting him. "You bastard!What do you mean I seduced you first? Who climbed into my bed in the middle of the night begging to be with you?"

"You seduced me! Those photos are proof. Without them. I wouldn't have fallen out with Grace. It's all your fault. you bitch."


The two started cursing each other in front of everyone, airing all their dirty laundry.


Harper,fierce all her life. started fighting. Indigo didn't hold back either.and the sound of slaps made everyone flinch.


Isabella couldn't help but move farther away, fearing she'd be hurt by mistake


Bianca looked mortified, but she was too weak to intervene.

So she directed all her anger at Isabella, "Isabella, are you satisfied now?Mr. Brown gave you shares, you have a say in the Brown Group,my career is ruined because of you, and my family is in shambles. What more
do you want? You're just flaunting in front of me by the Brown Group's shares. Without Michael backing you, what are you?" Bianca looked extremely aggrieved.


Unfortunately for her, this tactic worked on Michael but not on Isabella.

Isabella smirked coldly. "Ive never relied on Michael's power. The only ones backing me are my family and myself. Besides. I have plenty of money. It's you who values Michael so much. As the heiress to the Wilson Group. I can have any man I want. Why would I settle for him?"
###Chapter 70 Don't You Have Anything to Expl ain to Me?

"From now on, my attorney will handle everything.The Taylor Family will pay back tenfold. a hundredfold, for the pain my mother endured.Enjoy it slowly: I can wait it."

Isabella stood up without hesitation. her eyes filled with a chilling coldness.

What the Taylor Family owed her back then wouldn't be so easily forgiven.

As she pushed open the door. the first thing she saw was a pair of deep.dark eyes.


Michael. dressed in a sharp. iron-gray tailored suit. the same one he wore to the office. stood there quietly. It was unclear how long he had been there.

She had clearly told him not to follow her when she came, but hestill came.

As for whom he came for, she didn't need to think much.

One was his first love, Bianca, whom he had cherished for over a decade.and the other was Isabella, who was about to divorce him. Naturally,he came to support Bianca.

Of course.knowing her temper, how could he not come to protect Bianca?

She knew that in his heart, she wasn't even a tenth as important as Bianca.but every time she saw it with her own eyes, it still hurt deeply.

Why did she have to fall in love with Michael, a man she could never truly have?
No matter how many times she was hurt, she couldn't harden her heart.

She thought to herself. 'Isabella, how can you be so foolish? You are the heiress of the Wilson Family, pampered by Daniel and five uncles for over a decade.and the rightful heiress to the Wilson Group. You can't be soft-hearted towards Michael anymore.


Isabella took a deep breath, he clear eyes meeting Michael's gaze. She no longer concealed her aura and dominance.

She raised her eyebrows slightly. "You must have heard what I just said.Good.it saves me the trouble of repeating myself."


Although Michael had long suspected Isabella's true identity. it was still hard for him to believe when the truth was revealed.


For the first time, he felt the sting of heartache.

She had countless opportunities to tell him her identity over the past three years.but she chose to remain silent.


Even when he confronted her directly, asking who she was, she didn't admit it.

She didn't even want to acknowledge her identity as his wife.

But now, she easily told everyone else, while he, as her husband,had to overhear it from behind a door.

Frustration and anger surged within him, his eyes flashing with red.

"Isabella, you've hidden this from me for three years. Don't you have anything to explain?" Even if it was just a word, he could forgive her for everything.
Isabella, however. smiled coldly. "Michael, don't you think that question is meaningless? Our divorce is certain. What else do I need to explain to you?”


Sensing the extreme anger in Michael's eyes. Isabella only thought he was venting his anger on her because of Bianca.


Even if she just said a harsh word to Bianca. Michael would unreasonably side with Bianca and demand that she apologize personally.

Previously, she valued him too much, making every step difficult.

Now. she wouldn't care about his feelings anymore.


No matter how far he went for Bianca. her revenge on the Taylor Family would not change for anything.

"Michael. Ill see you in court," Isabella looked into his eyes,called his name. and said the last words between them.

Then, she walked past him and left directly.

The door was wide open, and seeing that Michael had really come.Bianca's tears fell as she ran over to cry. "Michael. you're finally here.You heard everything. right? Isabella is really too much. It's bad enough she took our home. but now she wants to destroy my career and my father's company.She's pushing our whole family to the brink. What did we ever do to her?The Taylor Family is her home too. How can she do this?"

Bianca cried while pulling on Michael, her tears hanging at the corners of her eyes, looking pitiful.

But at this moment. Michael was deeply troubled by Isabella's words.
If he had known her visit would cause such a reaction, he would have stopped her.

In the office, she still acted coquettishly towards him.even though he knew it was fake. at least she wouldn't mention divorce.

Now. hearing Bianca crying and complaining in his ear, he only felt annoyed. Just as he was about to shake off her grip. Thomas. dressed in a black trench coat. walked out. Behind him was a lawyer in a sharp suit.Ryan.

Michael frowned.thinking. Why are they here to0?

Thomas' gaze fell on the intertwined arms of Bianca and Michael.especially since Michael, knowing Isabella had left. was still entangled with Bianca.

A sharp.cold light flashed in his eyes.

There had been rumors that Michael's heart belonged to Bianca, not Isabella. Seeing it with his own eyes, he realized how difficult Isabella's three years with the Brown Family had been.

He had willingly married her. yet now he protected Bianca in front of Isabella.

If he dared to bully Isabella like this, Thomas would not let it go unpunished.

Thomas' lips pressed into a thin line.

Without a word, he gave Ryan a look, brushed past Michael's shoulder.and strode away to catch up with Isabella.
Ryan.maintaining his professional demeanor, calmly addressed Michael."Mr. Brown. I am Ms. Taylor's attorney. She forgot to mention something earlier. This house is jointly owned by you and her.She doesn't like these people living here and hopes you can handle it quickly. or it will affect the division of property later."

With that. Ryan left.

He had conveyed Isabella's message accurately: the rest was up to Michael.

With Isabella's declaration to see him in court and the renowned lawyer Ryan following up. Michael's face darkened.

He shouldn't have taken on the trouble of Bianca's family in the first place.

Now he had to deal with these problems.


But the Taylors didn't see it that way. Seeing everyone leave. they approached Michael.

They hoped Michael could help them.

After all.he had promised them the house. How could he go back on his word?


"Isabella, that ungrateful girl. who knows what kind of people taught her to be like this over the years. She has no manners and always wants to make her biological father' lives miserable. What is she thinking? Michael.you should divorce her as soon as possible. Bianca has waited for you for three years. Once you're divorced. you can marry Bianca." Indigo suggested, thinking that once Bianca married into the Brown Family, his company's issues would be easily resolved.
###Chapter 71 Bianca, You've Crossed the Line

Harper quickly chimed in. "Exactly. Michael. Bianca has wasted so many years waiting for you. You can't just abandon her."

As she spoke. Harper gave Bianca a push towards Michael.

Bianca. not missing the opportunity. tried to wrap her arms around
Michael's waist. "Michael.are you really going to leave me?"

Just as her hand touched Michael's shirt. Bianca was flung away.

She fell to the ground.looking bewildered."Michael?"

Michael stood up. his face darkened. "Enough. Bianca. I've already repaid everything I owed you. I don't owe you anything anymore!"

Bianca was stunned. not knowing what to say to win Michael's heart back.

"Michael. I beg you, don't treat me like this. I really love you." Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably. This time. Bianca was truly panicked. She could feel that Michael had no patience left for her.

"You promised me you'd be good to me for a lifetime, that you'dprotect me. Do those promises mean nothing now?" At this moment. Bianca felt as if a bucket of ice water had been poured over her.

She had thought that Michael came here for her.

When she was dropped by the Wilson Group, it was Michael who arranged for her to sign with EchoMedia Group, bringing her the best resources.

When Isabella kicked her family out, it was Michael who arranged a place
for herto stay and even gave her a house.

She had always believed that Michael liked her.

Otherwise.who would do so much for someone they didn't like?

Now.he was telling her that he didn't owe her anything.

So. was he going to cut ties with her completely and never care about her again?

She could lose everything, but she couldn't lose him.

Michael was her spiritual pillar. Without him, it was no point of all her efforts over the years.

Facing Bianca's relentless entanglement. Michael responded with nothing but a cold stare. "Bianca, you know very well why I helped you. I never said I would marry you, nor did I ever mention liking you. You crossed the line!"

This time, not only did Bianca look ashen, but even the Indigo couple.who had been urging Michael to divorce Isabella,were completely stunned.

Michael's gaze swept over them. He had never been friendly to them. and now, with this incident, his face darkened even more.

"You know what you've done. I advise you not to use the photos to threaten Isabella, or T'll make sure you disappear from Evergreen City.Every bit of suffering she endured back then, you should repay tenfold in pain. From today on, don't let me see you again." Michael couldn't stand it for another minute.

He slammed the door and left.
He didn't know where to find Isabella, and he was afraid that finding her would only provoke her to ask for a divorce.


He could only go to a bar and order the most expensive and strongest drinks.


He drank one glass after another. trying to get himself drunk.

His mind kept replaying memories of Isabella's childhood, the year before she left. small and thin. What had she gone through in the Taylor Family?

Why hadn't he cared for her properly in the past three years.always using Bianca to provoke her?

He had arrogantly thought she married him for the Brown Family's interests and wealth.


He had deliberately neglected her every time she reached out to him.

He deeply regretted that he had done.

At this moment. after Michael left, the Indigo family sat on the ground.staring blankly at the floor.

"What do we do? Michael really won't help us this time. He even sees us as enemies. Why is he protecting that bitch Isabella? We don't even have a backer now." Harper moaned weakly, but no one around her responded"

Bianca was in a daze, thinking about Michael's parting words.

Indigo was spooked, well aware of the formidable reputation of the influential Wilson Family from the East Coast, and he knew he was playing with fire.

Harper was on the verge of madness. She ignored the scene of tearing and
fighting with Indigo carlier. grabbed his sleeve, and shook it vigorously."Indigo, are you deaf? I'm asking you a question. At this point. pretending to be mute won't help. Think of something!"

Indigo pushed her away, annoyed. "At this point, what can I do? We've reached this stage because of you. Bianca doesn't know how to win a man's heart.but you should. If she had gotten pregnant in the past three years.we wouldn't be in this situation. Now. Michael is bewitched by that bitch Isabella. What do we have to fight her with?”

"So what do we do? Just wait to die? Even if it's not the Wilson Family.Michael could end us with a single word."

Harper was about to sit on the ground and wail, but Indigo covered her mouth. "Shut up. Didn't you hear that bitch Isabella wants to ruin our family? Hurry up and pack your things and run. If the Wilsons come.we re really dead."

Harper turned pale with fear. They quickly got up to pack their valuables.

When they tried to sneak out after dark, they were terrified by the sight of two men in black standing outside the door.

Indigo covered Harper's mouth and quickly closed the door.

He sat on the couch, trembling uncontrollably. "It's over. The Wilsons really wants us dead. They've blocked the door."

Harper was too scared to cry, silently sobbing with her mouth covered.

Bianca's face was pale, her hands clenched tightly, her emotins on the verge of collapse.

She had been humiliated by Isabella at the Brown Group in the morning.
warned by Michael. who had cut ties with her. and now the Wilson Family was targeting her family.

In one night. she had lost everything.

And it was all because of Isabella.

However. She couldn't just give up.

She thought to herself. 'Isabella is just a woman who has been kicked out of her homne as a child. How could she suddenly appear after so many years and take everything that belonged to me? Everything I want. I have taken from Isabella since childhood. Michael would be no exception.'

She had loved Michael for over a decade, obsessed and secretly in love. If she couldn't have him.she wouldn't even want to live.

Suddenly, a flash of determination appeared in Bianca's eyes as she thought of a way to strikeback at Isabella.

She quickly took out her phone and dialed a number, thinking.'Michael.T'Il make you see who truly loves you.

When she exposed Isabella's true nature. Michael would realize what kind of person Isabella really was.

After hanging up.Bianca returned to her room.

Late at night, she sneaked out through the window.
###Chapter 72 Both Drunk

At Starlit Tavern. Isabella walked straight into a private room reserved just for her. where her favorite liquor was already laid out on the table.

The Wilson Family made their fortune throughgambling,and they have an indomitable spirit in their blood.

Isabella thought to herself. Isabella, you are the most beloved heiress of the Wilson Family, what kind of man can't you have? Daniel and your five uncles have been grooming you as the heiress since you were a child.not to see you heartbroken and tortured over Michael. He doesn't deserve your sorrow.

Isabella swirled the red liquid in her glass, as if making a decision.and then downed the drink.

After tonight. she would no longer let herself be trapped in an impossible relationship.realizing it was time to move forward.

Three years of marriage. which was finally coming to an end.

There was a knock on the door. and Isabella called out for them to enter.Her subordinate Jesse walked in.

Seeing her alone with a table full of liquor, clearly intending to get drunk.he felt both heartache and relief for Isabella.

After tomorrow, Isabella would finally be back.

If it weren't for that accident three years ago, Isabella wouldn't have had to use the marriage contract to force a wedding. She was born to explore a broader world.
"Jesse, what's up?"

"Ms. Taylor, do you want to inform Mr. Wilson about what happened today?"

Thinking of Daniel, who was still recuperating in the hospital. Isabella felt a sudden heaviness in her heart.


Daniel's greatest wish was for her and Michael to have a child.so he could hold her child in his lifetime. Unfortunately, she couldn't fulfill his wish.

Tomorrow, she would completely end things with Michael.

But Daniel couldn't accept such an outcome. His health couldn't take any more shocks.

Isabella took a deep breath. "Don't mention it for now. I'll explain it to him personally after some time."

Jesse nodded, said no more. and left, closing the door behind him.standing guard outside.

In the empty room. Isabella was accompanied by a table full of liquor.


Tonight, she just wanted to get drunk.

In her own establishment, she could drink as much as she wanted,and no one would question her.

Before her consciousness completely faded. Isabella made a call to Thomas.
"Thomas, inform Michael to be at the court on time tomorrow.Also.return the $950 million he spent on the red diamond necklace he bought from the Wilson Family!"

If they were going to break up, it had to be clean.
The Wilson Family didn't need that money.


She would find a way to cover the financial gap at the Wilson Group and ensure the company faced no issues.

But as for Michael, she wouldn't give him any more opportunities.

She just hoped never to see him again in her lifetime.

Thomas had always had issues with Michael. and now hearing that Isabella wanted to completely sever ties with him, he felt both relieved and heartbroken.


Isabella, whom they cherished, was meant to live a free and unrestrained life. but she had unfortunately met Michael.

Now. this was for the best. Isabella wouldn't be hurt anymore after separated with him.

The Brown Villa.

At the Brown Villa, somehow, what Stella did to Isabella in the dining room reached Aiden's ears.

Aiden was furious, clutching his chest as he instructed the servant."Go get Mrs. Brown, I have something to say!"

Aiden had seen everything Stella did to Isabella over the past three years.He had opinions but never voiced them because Isabella was magnanimous and didn't care.

But now, he had to intervene.

Michael was already clueless about relationships, and if Stella kept meddling. Michael and Isabella would be torn apart sooner or later.
He had personally promised Isabella to keep her identity a secret.

But now, he had to stand up for Isabella to put Stella in her place.


Stella had just heard about Isabella going to Indigo's place and was about to call Mlichael to scold Isabella.

She was stunned when Aiden suddenly called her over for a talk.

Seeing Sophia's serious expression. she felt even more panicked.


She had never been favored by Aiden in the family and rarely spoke to him. She didn't know wvhy he suddenly called her over now. thinking it could be something bed.


Despite her thoughts. She wouldn't dare to disobey Aiden.

Standing before Aiden. Stella cautiously spoke, "You called for me?"


Aiden glanced at her, motioning for the servant to leave. Once theywere alone. he coldly spoke. "Have you heard of the Wilson Family from the East of Valoria, the Gambling King Mr. Wilson?"

Stella was stunned and nodded. Before she could ask what was going on.Aiden continued. "Isabella is his only granddaughter."

With just one simple sentence, Stella was left in shock.

She was completely dumbfounded.

It took her a while to react. "Dad, you must be joking. How could Isabella be Mr. Wilson's granddaughter? If she were, wouldn't she be the only heiress of the Wilson Family?"

"What do you think?" Aiden gave her a coldI look.
She had treated Isabella like a servant for three years,and now she was scared.

"Let me tell you. Isabella is the real heiress of a wealthy family,a thousand times better than Bianca. Their marriage contract wwas hard-carned by me.Michael's wife can only be lsabella. From now on, if anyome in this house mentions Bianca,don't blame me for getting angry.

Stella was too shocked to say a word.

She returned to her nom in a daze.filled with nyret.

She had even offered a few houses to get lsabella to divorce Michael.fearing she would covet the Brown Family's wealth.

If she had known Isabella was from such a wealthy family,she would never have let Michael divorce her. Such a family background was something she couldn't even dream of.

As night fell. Michael was still at the bar, drinking one glass after another.

But strangely, despite all the alcohol. his mind remained excessively clear.

His memories were full of Isabela.as a child. as a married woman. but without exception she had never smiled at him.

She must resent him.

In three years of marriage, all she wanted was a child, but he had done everything to avoid her, even using hurtful words to insult her.

The current outcome was his own doing; he had hurt her too deeply.

So,she would never forgive him.
As the wine in his glass ran out again, the sadness in Michael's eyes was overwhelming.


His phone rang in his pocket, and he answered in a hoarse voice. It was Thomas.
###Chapter 73 Are You and Him Getting a Di vor ce?

"Mr. Brown. I'msorry to call at this hour. Isabella asked me to inform you that she has decided to officially divorce you. See you in court before 9AM tomorrow. By the way, the $950 million you paid for the diamond necklace from the Wilson Family will be refunded to your account tomorrow. If Mr. Brown understands the rules. please do notdisturb her life anymore." Thomas' tone was indifferent, but the threat was obvious.

Last time. Michael secretly fled the country, leaving Isabella alone in court.
Thomas would remember that for a lifetime.

A man like Michael, who lacked responsibility. was not worthy of Isabella.

He would not allow such a thing to happen again.

After hearing this. Michael squinted his eyes. his voice cold and deep."Thomas. you are clearly Isabella's uncle, yet you deliberatelymisled me about your true identity. What are you up to?"

Although he was questioning, he didn't give Thomas on the other end of the line any chance to speak. "Isabella and I have been married for three years. You didn't show up before, but now you are actively helping her with the divorce. As an elder, can't you bear to see us reconcile?"

No matter what, he would never divorce Isabella.

The thought of her completely cutting ties with him and turning to another man made him uncontrollably furious and mad.

She was his, and no one could take her away from him.
Thomas only sneered at Michael's unreasonable behavior. "Michael.how can you say such things? You know better than anyone what kind of life Isabella had in the Brown Family for the past three years. She has become like this all because of you. Reconcile? Stop dreaming. Ms. Wilson can have any man she wants. Without you, there are plenty of men lining up for her. each one better than you."

After saying this. Thomas hung up.

Isabella had already wasted three years on him and suffered three years of emotional pain. As her uncle. Thomas wished Michael would stay far away and never appear in front of Isabella again.

Thomas' words over the phone left Michael staring at his drink.suddenly losing the desire to continue drinking.

Meanwhile. the bar where Isabella was located had been targeted.

As soon as she entered the neighborhood where Indigo lived,she was already being watched.


They thought it was just like the last time when her parents were kicked out. but unexpectedly, they overheard a bombshell.

More than one media outlet was present, and to grab the headlines, they broke the news as soon as Isabella left the neighborhood.


The revelation that Isabella was the heiress of the Wilson Family instantly made headlines online.


In just a few minutes, the number of shares reached millions.

From initially stealing Bianca's boyfriend and kicking Indigo out of the house, to the revelation of her identity as a racing queen, Isabella had
transformed into te enviable heiress of the Wilson Group.

With the Wilson Family's unparalleled background behind her and being the only recognized heiress of the Wilson Group, her net worth had long reached unimaginable figures.

Isabella's status made her and Michael a perfect match.

Especially after the news spread that Aiden personally gifted her shares.holding half of the Brown Group's assets, she now controlled the economic lifelines of two major families in the Southeast.

Such a status and background were far from being a country woman scheming to climb up by clinging to Michael.

Many people felt that Michael was the one who was out of his league with Isabella.


After all. with everything Isabella had,she still loved Michael for three years.even enduring his misunderstandings without leaving.

Theonly reason was Isabella had truly fallenin love,so that she would give up everything to stay by his side.

The online discussions were heated, and public opinion had drastically changed.

Isabella came out of the bar late at night,supported by Jesse.

Unexpectedly, as soon as she stepped outside, a crowd surrounded her.looking at her like she was a wealthy celebrity, full of envy.

Some even took out her photo, asking for her autograph.

Isabella was very drunk, seeing double, and couldn't understand a word of
what was being said.

Jesse had the reporters cleared out and found a nearby five-star hotel for Isabella to stay in.


Lying on the soft bed, staring at the crystal chandelier that made her head ache.


Isabella curled up. enduring the burning sensation from the alcohol.constantly reminding herself that this was the last time she would get drunk over Michael.

Just as she was about to fall asleep. her phone suddenly rang. displaying a name she hadn't seen in a long time. It was Nolan.


The drunkenness in her head instantly dissipated. Isabella grabbed her phone and sat up. answering the call. "Nolan, is that you?"

However. Nolan was on the other side of the world. Why would he suddenly call after being silent for so long?

Nolan,one of her few friends, and Michael's second brother.

Nolan was handsome,capable,and always polite.

Originally. Aiden had favored him as the heir, but unfortunately.something happened.

When she first saw him, she almost mistook him for Michael, but later realized they were nothing alike.

Their personalities were worlds apart.

They got along well and had unique insights into the business world.eventually becoming friends.
Shortly after she married Michael. Nolan voluntarily went abroad.

In the past three years,they had hardly been in touch.

Hearing Isabella's surprise over the phone. Nolan chuckled warmly."Of course it's me. Who else would it be?"

"Isabella.are you and Michael having a big fight?"

"How do you know that from abroad?" Isabella was extremely surprised.

The news of her divorce from Michael had only recently broken online.Had it spread abroad so quickly?

She knew Nolan's character; he wasn't one to follow such news.

Since going abroad, he hadn't cared about domestic affairs.

He would only call during holidays to greet Aiden.

"I found out by accident while talking to Grandpa." Nolan's deep voice paused. "I saw the news online. Are you really divorcing Michael?"

"Yes, first thing tomorrow morning!" Isabella didn't hide anything.

She had made up her mind about divorcing Michael from the moment she brought it up. It was only delayed because of Daniel's illness and Aiden's concerns.
###Chapter 74 Nolan

Moreover. Nolan was her friend, so there wasno need to hide this matter.


However, since Nolan was Michael's brother, there were some things she needed to say upfront.

"Nolan, you're not here to persuade me not to get a divorce. are you?" She had completely given up on Michael.

She thought Nolan would try to persuade her, but instead, he chuckled on the other end of the phone. "After so long without contact.you think I'm here to play peacemaker between you two?"

His questioning tone denied Isabella's assumption. "You said it yourself.we haven't been in touch for so long. Nolan, you suddenly call me now and bring up my divorce with Michael. Isn't it normal to think you're here to play peacemake?"

After all. Nolan was Michael's brother.

They were the ones with the closest blood relationship.

Isabella lay on the bed, staring at the crystal chandelier above, lost in thought. "Nolan, you know. I tried for three years, and in those three years.I couldn't make him love me. Now that I think about it, maybe I was wrong from the start. This marriage shouldn't have existed."

When they first got married, Bianca caused a lot of trouble, and Michael often left her alone at home to comfort Bianca.

He would take Bianca to watch fireworks and attend various high-end events.
Later. when Bianca returned to the country. Michael immediately went to accompany her and celebrate her birthday.


Even when she found them at night, heartbroken and asked for a divorce.it didn't soften his heart at all.

He still protected Bianca. When she revoked Bianca's endorsement.Michael hadhis subsidiary sign Bianca, giving her numerous resources and even letting Indigo's family move into his apartment.

Every step Michael took was hurting her heart to protect Bianca.

When disappointment accumulated to a certain extent.she completely lost hope in Michael.

Even though she had loved Michael for over a decade, she decided to let go.

She couldn't talk about these things with Thomas and the others, but she knew Nolan understood her feelings at this moment.

When she married into the Brown Family and Michael neglected her, it was Nolan who comforted her like a brother.


She didn't have a brother, and over time, she naturally regarded Nolan as one.

She was afraid that if Nolan spoke, she might waver.

After all. in her heart. Nolan's position was still very important.

"I understand everything."

"I understand everything." On the other end of the phone. Nolan sighed softly. "Calling you so suddenly. I just wanted to tell you. Isabella,do what
you want to do. Whatever choice you make. I support you."


Isabella could hardly believe what she heard. "Nolan, you're really not going to persuade me? I thought you would sidle with Michael."

After all. their relationship was closer.

"No.I respect every choice you make because I just want you to be happy."Nolan's voice was very low and gentle. like a feather lightly brushing.warm and comforting.

At this moment. all the long-suppressed grievances in Isabella's heart were released by his words.

Her nose tingled. and tears uncontrollably streamed down her face as she choked up."Nolan. thank you."

For so long, she had been holding on, not wanting others to see her vulnerable side.especially in front of Michael and Bianca.

"It's fine. When did our relationship become so formal? Isn't your birthday coming up? Is there anything you want?" Even when he was abroad.Nolan never forgot Isabella's birthday gift each year.

He was always generous in this regard.

But Isabella had already received the best gift, which was his understanding.

"No need for a gift. I'm just getting a year older. I only hope that I can become stronger in the future and support my grandfather's company. As for otherthings, there's nothing I want." If Notan hadn't mentioned it,she would have forgotten about her birthday.
"Really?" Nolan said deliberately. "I thought my return to the country would make you happy. Since you don't want anything, then forget it."

Hearing that. Isabella's eyes lit up. Nolan had gone to Seraphis shortly after her marriage, and this was the first time he had actively returned to the country.

"Really? Nolan, when are you coming back? I'll pick you up.We haven't seen each other in so long."


After hanging up Isabella was genuinely happy.

Nolan's sudden return to the country, and just before her birthday.

By then, she would have divorced Michael, with free time and no one to control her.


She would definitely find time to catch up with Nolan.

Just as she put down her phone and cleared her mind. planning to take a bath,she heard someone knocking on the door.

"Who is it?"

No one answered.

Isabella frowned. Jesse had booked the best room in the hotel, so it was unlikely anyone would disturb her at this time.

She couldn't help but thought. 'And where is Jesse? Isn't he outside? Why doesn't he stop them?

"Room service,pplease open the door!"

The voice outside was low, but it was faintly recognizable as a woman's.
Isabella frowned and went to open the door. "Didn't I say I didn't want to be disturbed? You..."


Halfway through her sentence. Isabella was stunned by the beautiful face in front of her.


Standing in front of her was Olivia, wearing a sexy black mini dress. and a guilty-looking Jesse.

Olivia looked like she had just come back from a night out. with heavy makeup. a camisole, sequined stockings. and a mini dress. plus those high heels.


If it weren't for her mischievous smile, no one would recognize her as the famous star Olivia.

"Did I disturb you, Isabella?" Olivia flirtatiously reached out to lift Isabella's chin. "On such a cold night, how could I let you sleep alone? So I brought myself here."

After saying that. Olivia couldn't heIp but laughed.

Isabella slapped her hand away and pulled Olivia into the room."Why are you here? No, how did you know I was here? And what's with this outfit?It's the middle of the night. aren't you cold?"

In the late autumn weather. Olivia was barely wearing anything. Just looking at her made Isabella feel cold.

Olivia put her arm around Isabella's shoulder and said as they walked."You don't know? The news of your impending divorce with Michael is all over the internet. I thought you might need some company, so I came to find you."
Olivia said it lightly. but Isabella raised an cyebrow. "So. who told you where I am?"


She wanted to know so she could be more cautious in the future.


Olivia didn't intend to hide it from her and said directly. "You know him too. who is Mr. Wilson. Of course, he didn't say it outright.but I guessed it.



In Evergreen City. aside from Thomas, no one else knew where she was.

Moreover. Thomas was always meticulous. At this time, he must worry about her, so he leaked the information to Olivia.
###Chapter 75 Queen of the Nightclub

"Isabella, you're finally about to be single again. Why do you keep staying alone at the hotel? How about..." Olivia gave Isabella's strap a playful tug and grinned mischievously. "Let's go out and have some fun. Consider it an early celebration."


Where they were headed was clear from Olivia's outfit.

But Isabella was too exhausted. She had drunk too much earlier and was barely holding it together to speak coherently. So she really didn't have the strength to go to the nightclub till dawn.

However. Olivia's eager gaze made it hard for Isabella to refuse directly.

She found a passable excuse. "It's too late, and I didn't bring a change of clothes. There's no way to do my makeup here. How about we go another day?"

She was so dizzy she just wanted to collapse into bed.

But she underestimated Olivia's determination. Hearing Isabella mention she had no clothes. Olivia raised an eyebrow and called out, "Bring it in."

As soon as she finished speaking. Jesse walked in with a small suitcase.


Isabella glanced at Jesse, wondering whose side he was on.

Jesse didn't dare look up. dropped off the suitcase, and quickly left.

Watching Olivia open the suitcase to reveaI a full set of makeup and a sizzling hot mini dress, Isabella felt a headache coming on.

Olivia had solved all her problems and didn't seem likely to give her a
chance to back out, as she had even brought the stuff with her.


After a quick face wash, Isabella was seated in front of the makeup mirror by Olivia.


Olivia expertly applied her makeup, using everything to make her look as seductiveas possible. With a final touch of red lipstick, they headed straight to the most luxurious nightclub in Evergreen City.


At Lightning Speed, both women were stunning, drawing eyes as they walked in.


Colorful lights swirled overhead, and the heavy metal music pounded into their brains. Men and women in the dance floor moved freely to the rhythm.

A tall man in a shirt and slacks stood out among them, his graceful movements captivating everyone.

At the bar. Bianca, in a light pink spaghetti strap dress, stared intently at the tall man in the dance floor, and her eyes sparkled.

She had known Michael for so long, but she never knew he was so talented at dancing.

He danced so well that people were gathering around him.


She had come to the nightclub to vent after Michael's harsh words,but unexpectedly ran into him.

She had always maintained a pure image in front of Michael. If he found out she was at a nightclub, all her efforts to maintain that facade would be exposed.
As Bianca hesitated, two striking figures entered the nightclub.

Both were tall, with alluring figures, wearing skimpy spaghetti strap mini dresses, and their seductive makeup made hearts race.

Realizing the one in the back looked so familiar. Bianca took a closer look.and found it was Isabella.


She couldn't help but curse in her head. 'That bitch Isabella must have found out Michael is here and follow him to create a "chance" encounter.She has sworn to divorce Michael during the day, and now she is here to seduce him. No wonder Michael can't let her go.These are all her schemes and tricks. I won't let her have Michael.


Isabella followed Olivia inside. As she re-entered the familiar environment and music.she felt strange.


She realized she hadn't been to a place like this in a long time.

Since marrying Michael, she had cut ties with her old self.

In three years of marriage, she hadn't even been to a bar, let alone a nightclub.


Olivia naturally swayed to the music beside her, whispering in Isabella's ear. "You used to be the hottest nightclub queen here. Dancing, playing cards.singing-you were the best at all of them. It's all Michael's fault for locking you up."

"Now you're finally going to be single again. Let's party hard tonight, and tomorrow you can divorce Michael. After that, we can come here every day without anyone stopping us." Olivia deliberately brought up the past.

She hadn't planned to go out, but Thomas had called her, telling her about
Isabella's situation and mood.

She had immediately gotten up. put on makeup, and rushed over.

Since Isabella was determined to leave Michael, it was time for the old Isabella to return.


But Olivia didn't know that from the moment Isabella stepped into the nightclub. a huge change had occurred in her heart.

The alcohol in her system wvas the perfect catalyst. Tonight, she decided to play hard. to make up for everything she had missed.

She raised an eyebrow at Olivia and gestured towards the bar."Just dancing is boring. How about a drink first?"

Seeing the light return to Isabella's eyes, Olivia was thrilled and dragged her to a booth.


She generously handed over the drink menu. "Order whatever you want.It's on me tonight."

Isabella smiled and took the menu without hesitation.

She ordered the most expensive and strongest drinks in the house.

Olivia preferred cocktails and didn't like srong liquor, so she ordered a Mojito.

The waiter took the order back to the bar, where Bianca accidentally bumped into him and helped pick up the fallen menu.

When Bianca saw the drinks that had been selected, a flash of triumph crossed her eyes.
She thought. 'Isabella, aren't you the Wilson Family's heiress? This time. T'Il make sure you lose all your dignity in front of everyone.


Soon. the drinks Isabella ordered arrived. Oliviasipped her cocktail.her eyes occasionally glancing at the dance foor.

Isabella took a sip of her drink, the vodka's strong flavor hitting her hard.

It was intense, more so than anything she had drunk at a bar.

Isabella stopped after half a glass, not wanting to get too drunk.When she felt just right. she pulled Olivia into the dance floor.

The atmosphere reached its peak, the lights above flashing faster.Isabella relaxed and moved to the music.


She looked like a glowing red sprite. too sexy to look at directly, as if she belonged there.


Many people stopped to watch her in awe, some recognizing the familiar figure.

"Am I seeing things? Isn't she the once-famous nightclub queen?"

"It's really her. I thought she'd never come back."

"Yeah. She's really back."

The crowd's eyes lit up, shouting at her, "Queen! One more song!"

Suddenly,the lights went out.

Sudddenly, the lights went out, and a passionate voice from the stage announced, "Ladies and gentlemen, next up is Lightning Speed's traditional event, the Mystery Three Mlinutes. Do what you want, seize the
moment. The opportunity is in your hands."
###Chapter 76 She Mistook Him for Nolan

Isabella was dancing with abandon when the sudden blackout dampened her spirits.

After all that dancing. the alcohol in her system began to take effect.

Feeling dizzy, she quickly tried to leave the dance floor. relying on her memory.

She had barely taken a few steps when a strong hand suddenly grabbed her. Isabella, feeling extremely dizzy,tried to resist but was held even tighter.

Soon.she was dragged to a quiet corner.

Her back pressed against a cold wall, and in front of her was the heavy breathing of a stranger. This state made Isabella frown in discomfort.

The coldness sobered her up a bit, but the man's actions became increasingly bold.

He was a head tallerthan her, pinning her against the wall with his large frame. his hands roaming freely, even reaching below her waist.

"Get off!" Isabella became alert, and she tried to stop his hand,but the alcohol in her system was too strong.

Her voice, instead of being threatening.sounded seductive.

"Do you know who I am? If you touch me again, I'll make sure you... Ah!"Before Isabella could finish her threat, she was lifted off the ground, her legs forced to wrap around the man's lean waist.
The man's heavy breathing amplified in her ear.

She had no idea how much her "threatening" tone sounded like a plea.making her seem soft and delicate. If she had stayed where she was. who knew how many people would have targeted her.

The hand around her waist tightened. and Isabella felt like she was about to suffocate.


The man grunted. holding her buttocks as he walked. seemingly trying to take her away from there.

Isabella.though dizzy,realized she was in trouble.

She struggled with her hands and twisted her body, trying to break free.

"Let go of me." Her vision was still pitch black, and Isabella felt a sudden panic. thinking she really going to be carried away by this man.

Isabella struggled harder, but it only made the man's grip tighten.

Suddenly, there was a sharp slap. Her buttocks were slapped crisply.

The man's deep, hoarse voice came through. "Isabella, if you keep moving.
believe it or not. I'll have sex with you right here."


Isabella shuddered.

Olivia's makeup was so good that even shebarely recognized herself. How did this man recognize her?

The pain in her buttocks made her hold on for a few seconds. She needed to see who this person was.

In her daze, she heard the door beep open.
In the faint light from outside. Isabella saw the man's sharp brow. She couldn't see much further down.

Those eyes, filled with malice. looked so much like Michael's.


She was at a nightclub, where Michael would never be interested. So she thought she must have been mistaken.


She blinked hard, trying to see the man more clearly, but he moved too quickly. Entering and locking the door took only a moment. so the last bit of light disappeared.

The strong aftereffects of the alcohol made Isabella feel like the world was spinning when she was thrown onto the bed.

Her body was burning up; she felt so hot and thirsty.


"I need water." Her pleading tone filled the man's breath,and Isabella.seemingly unaware of the approaching danger, helplessly twisted her graceful body against him.

Michael felt like he was on fire, his desire to have sex with her completely overwhelming his rationality.


He had only left her for a while, and she dared to wear such revealing clothes, dance in a nightclub, and drink.

He just wanted to teach her a lesson, to remind her that she was a married woman.

In fact, when Isabella leaned in and said she was hot, he had already reacted.


The large floor-to-ceiling window let in a bit of starlight. Michael tore open
his collar, supporting her with his palm, his body pressing down.

He had waited for this moment for a long time.

His large hand covered the thin strap on her shoulder. With a little force.there would be nothing left to cover her.

Isabella was so drunk she had no idea where she was.


Like in a dream, she murmured. "Nolan. you're finally coming back. I miss you so much..."

Her voice was like honey, and just from her tone, one could tell how happy she was.

But to Michael's ears, it was like a knife stabbing into his heart.

MichaeI's face turned ashen, his hands clenched tightly in front of her,suppressing his overwhelming anger, and he got up from her.

Isabella had mistaken him for Nolan. Standing by the bed, Michael trembled with rage.

Isabella was his wife, and in her drunken stupor, she called out Nolan.

More than anyone, he wanted to know why. Was Nolan the one in her heart?


The anger burned so fiercely that Michael could barely control himself. He picked up Isabella from the bed and strode into the bathroom.

When the cold water spread over her body. Isabella shivered,regaining a bit of clarity.

She saw the white bathtub and the indistinet shadow by the door.
Isabella shook her head, and when she looked again, she clearly saw Michael's face, dark and icy.

So,she hadn't been mistaken earlier.


The water in the tub was cold, but Isabella's body was burning. She even wondered if she was sick, why her body reacted so strongly after drinking a bit of alcohol.

The alternating cold and heat made her shiver all over.


Michael turned to her, his face dark as he stared at her. "Are you sober now?"


Before Isabella could speak, he coldly warned. "If you still can't recognize me, don't think about coming out. Stay in there until you're completely sober!"


He wanted to see if she could still mistake him for Nolan.

He wanted her to know who her husband was.

"Michael. are you a pervert?" Isabella gritted her teeth.carefully feeling the smooth edge of the bathtub, and turned off the running water.

Under Michael's icy gaze, she slowly stood up, dripping water as she stepped out.

"You're really crazy. Didn't Thomas tell you we're getting divorced tomorrow? What do you mean by bringing me here now?" Isabella's lips were pale, but her demeanor didn't weaken a bit. "What? Are you going to have a breakup sex with me now?"

Isabella's words were sharp and unyielding.
After leaving the cold water, she realized something was wrong with her body: she was still so hot.

It was a heat that seemed to come from her blood, making her uncontrollably want to find something cold to relieve her discomfort.
###Chapter 77 Drugging
She suppressed the discomfort in her body and was about to leaive when a chill brushed across her face.

Her body reacted faster than her brain, and Isabella shuddered.

She looked up and met Michael's cold eyes and his hand gripping her chin.
"Look closely, who is standing in front of you?"

"I can see clearly. Michael. Stop blocking my way. Move. I need to go back." Realizing her body felt very wrong,she had to leave here now.

She tried to shake off Michael's hand but found herself pathetically weak.barely able to grasp his clothes with all her strength.

Her feverish body craved the coolness that Michael brought more than she did.

Michael seemed to see through her thoughts, his eyes darkening as his large hand slid from her chin. roaming freely over her exposed body.

Watching Isabella's face turn crimson, biting her lip and gasping uncontrollably. Michael's mind filled with wicked thoughts.

He wanted to make her unable to leave him, to beg him.

Isabella was now emotionally stirred in his hands. How could he not react?

"Isabella, are you okay?" Michael's deep, magnetic voice echoed seductively in the empty bathroom.

It completely shattered the last thread of reason in Isabella's mind.

She looked up at him in disbelie4, her unclear eyes meeting Michael's lips
curling into a domineering smile. "Beg me. and I'll give you everything!"

The heat in her body was about to consume her.

Michael in front of her was like a block of ice and an antidote prepared just for her.


All she had to do was beg him, and she would be free.


Her body's heat magnified her sensations, and her desire grew layer by layer within her. She clenched her fists tightly, tears welling up.

She was about to lose control, but she didn't want to be humiliated by him like this.


"Michael, you... get lost!" Isabella dug her nails into her palm, the pain bringing back a sliver of reason. "I would rather die than beg you. Don't think you can threaten me now."

She growled through gritted teeth, but inside,she was in turmoil.

Her body's reaction was too abnormal, the desire coming fiercely and without reason. So she realized she had been drugged.


Isabella just wanted to escape now. She took a step forward, but her legs gave way, and she fell into a broad embrace. The cool touch made her lose all reason. "Let, let go..."

Seeing Isabella, who was clearly struggling but still trying to push him away, Michael's eyes darkened. He scooped her up and threw her onto the large bed outside.

Not giving her any chance to escape, Michael pressed down on her.

Isabella was on the verge of collapse.
She wanted to push Michael away, but her body honestly clung to him.

The sensation from his touch made her crave more. but she couldn't bring herself to beg Michael.

At this moment. Michael was also struggling.

Isabella beneath him was clutching his clothes, crying and fussing, then pressing her face against his chest before pushing him away again.

She kept muttering for him to leave.

But the tears in her eyes betrayed her; she wanted him to stay.

Thinking of her sweetly calling out Nolan's name. MichaeI's face darkened.

He suppressed his impulses and desires,holding her mischievous hands in front of him. gripping her chin to make her look at him.

"Isabella. look at me. Who am I?" His eyes showed anticipation.

"You're Michael." Isabella bit her lip, her eyes half-closed, her body seemingly melting into a puddle. with only her reason struggling at the edge.

"Good girl!" Michael's deep voice coaxed her, his large hand roaming over her body.giving her what she wanted.

Isabella moaned softly in comfort.

"Isabella,call me."

"Michael."

"Keep going!" Michael couldn't hold back any longer and kissed her
deeply,trailing down her body.leaving his mark.

His large hand cupped her breast, squeezing it, and he was rewarded with a soft moan from Isabella. like a kitten,so enticing.

His fingers brushed through her damp hair, and Michael gently caressed her face. "Don't worry. T'll give it to you now."

When the pain came from below. Isabella frowned and instinctively pushed Michael away. "It hurts."

But it wasn't just her who was in pain; Michael was also in a difficult position.

"Good girl, bear with it for a while. It'll be better soon." He suppressed his urge to take her wildly. his palm gently massaging her waist.

He kissed her lips. grinding them gently.

Isabella shook her head, but as Michael's tongue invaded,she unconsciously opened her lips, and his tongue entwined tightly with hers.

His kiss was so deep that even the air was filled with the sound of their intimacy.

Isabella's body gradually changed, her voice becoming soft and weak.

Michael no longer held back, his eyes filled with extreme madness. His large hand gripped her waist, pulling her towards him, completely possessing her.

Strong sunlight streamed in through the floor-to-ceiling windows,and the room was a mess.

At this moment, Isabella was nestled in Michael's arms,sleeping soundly.
Michael woke up.glanced at Isabella in his arms, and tightened his hold on her, continuing to sleep.

Isabella was awakened by the light in her eyes, the soreness in her body reaching her consciousness first. making her hiss in pain.


She slowly opened her eyes and met a pair of devilish eyes that instantly sobered her up.


Seeing the person in front of her and the environment she was in. Isabella sat up in shock.

When she saw the kiss marks all over her body and the obvious finger marks on her inner thighs,she was stunned.

Michael was such a bastard. How hard did he go on her last night to leave so many marks on her body? Even her arms and ankles weren't spared.

She couldn't imagine how she had endured the long night under him.

"Michael.you jerk! Knowing we're getting divorced today, how could you do this to me?" Isabella grabbed the pillow beside her and threw it at Michael.


Michael blocked it with his hand, the light pillow not causing him any real harm.


After last night, he was in an excellent mood. "You were the one holding onto me, not letting me go. And, don't you remember youir condition last night? If I let you go, who were you planning to find?"

She had some memory of last night, but looking at the satisfied Michael in front of her, she was furious. "It's none of your business, as long as it's not you. Don't forget we're getting divorced today!"
Her body felt like it had been run over by a car. How much did Michael want to get back at her to make her body this sore on purpose?
###Chapter 78 Divorce

"Say that again!" Hearing that she was going to find someone else to help her. Michael's anger flared up instantly.

He still vividly remembered her delighted expression when she drunkenly called out Nolan's name last night.

It was precisely because of this that he used this method to make her realize that it was he who kissed her, and it was he who had sex with her.


What happened last night should have been fulfilled on their wedding night three years ago. Now it was just making up for lost time.


But what he didn't expect was that when Isabella woke up, her eyes were filled with anger and resentment, clearly showing regret for sleeping with him last night.

Michael couldn't denythat he felt hurt.

Isabella, still furious, said, "It would be the same if I said it again. If it wasn't you last night, it would have been someone else. We're no longer married. What right do you have to control me?"

"Fine. Isabella, you better not regret this." Michael's face darkened as he got out of bed, putting on the shirt and pants he had thrown under the bed last night. "I'll be waiting for you at the courthouse. You better come early and not waste my time."

If he hadn't understood Isabella's feelings before, last night's events made it clear.


No matter how much he tried to make amends, Isabella would never come back to him.
Since she loved someone else, he would let her go.

He agreed to the divorce, letting her go to Nolan, whom she kept in her heart.


Michael put on his clothes and slammed the door without looking back.

Isabella,still naked, watched Michael leave with gritted teeth.

Michael, after making love to her, just left like that. and he claimed he wasn't a jerk?


Thinking about how she inexplicably lost her virginity last night made Isabella furious. She grabbed an ornament from the bedside and threw it at the door. "Michael, you pervert, bastard."

While he had already walked away, and no one responded to her.

At this moment. Isabella, wrapped in a blanket,was covered in bruises,her eyes red, her lips swollen, and her body marked with purple and blue bruises, as if she had been severely "abused."

When had she ever suffered such a loss? It was all Michael's fault that she ended up like this.

If she ever got the chance, she would make him pay back double.

She would make him understand what it felt like to have legs so sore that he couldn't stand.

Just taking a small step made Isabella bite her lips in pain, her waist feeling like it was about to break.

She swore she would never let Michael off the hook.
But there wasn't much time left before she had to go to the courthouse.so she could only take a hot bath in the bathroom.


As she lay in the water relaxing. Isabella couldn't help but think about the series of events that happened last night.

If she hadn't entered that bar, she wouldn't have run into Michael.and there wouldn't have been any subsequent events.


Everything was normal last night. so why did she suddenly feel hot.with symptoms that seemed like she had been drugged?

The only person she had contact with was Michael, but Michael's arrogance wouldn't allow him to use such underhanded methods on a woman.

Besides. if he had any such intentions towards her. they wouldn't have gone three years without having sex. So it couldn't be Michael

Who would dare to drug her in a nightclub, and with an aphrodisiac at that? After all, her identity was well-known in Evergreen City, and going against her was like going against the Wilson Family.

The more Isabella thought about it, the more suspicious it seemed. She picked up her phone from the bedside and made a call. "I was set up at Lightning Speed last night. Use all means to find out who did it."

The person on the other end was someone she had trained herself.absolutely reliable.

It wasn't that she didn't trust Thomas, but she was afraid that if he found out she had slept with Michael last night, he could kilI him.

If things got out of hand, she wouldn't be able to hide it from Daniel and
Aiden.

Daniel was still in the hospital, and she couldn't just ignore everything.

Besides, she was officially divorcing Michael today, and a smooth divorce would give her peace of mind.


At 9:30 AM. Isabella arrived at the courthouse.She was almost familiar with this place.


As soon as she stepped in, she saw Michael already sitting in the waiting area.


Michael had changed into a custom-made iron-gray suit, looking refreshed.occasionally glancing at his watch, clearly having arrived earlier than her.


Seeing him made Isabella angry. He seemed relaxed. while she was in pain even walking.

She slowly walked up to him, and as soon as she stood still, she heard him coldly say. "You're half an hour late."

Hearing that. Isabella took a deep breath.

Didn't he know why she was late? Just as her suppressed anger was about to explode. Michael frowned and said, "Alright, now that you're here,let's start the process. I don't have much time."

Isabella was stunned. Michael was actually urging her to go through the divorce process? She thought she heard wrong.

Isabella looked up in surprise, but Michael turned and walked inside.afraid that if he looked at her any longer, he wouldn't be able to let go.

But just thinking about her dependence on Nolan made him furious.
His hands clenched tightly athis sides, and he finally steeled himself.

Since he had promised to let her go. he couldn't go back on his word.

Throughout the entire process. Michael was very cooperative. From filling out forms to signing. it was done quickly.


The troublesome matter that had dragged on for over a month was finally resolved.


After everything was done. Michael got up and left without looking back.

Isabella sat in the chair, feeling like all her strength had been drained.a nameless bitterness welling up in her heart.

It felt like everything had returned to the beginning.

Back then, she had used the marriage contract to force Michael to marry her, but he was unwilling. She had used some tricks and spent three months to make him agree.

But now, it was all over; she and Michael had no more ties, everything between them completely finished.

Isabella sat for a while, composed herself, and left to catch a cab to the hospital.

Her body was really in pain. And after last night's sex, although she saw condoms in the trash, she wasn't sure if Michael had used protection every time.

After all, in her not-so-dear memory, she had been begging for merey from Michael,but he still barely let her go until almost dawn.

Since they were divorced, she couldn't take that risk.
At the hospital. Isabella went in for a full check-up, and the results were as she expected.

Her lower body was severely swollen, with signs of tearing.

After asking for her opinion, the doctor prescribed anti-inflammatory medication and emergency contraception.


Isabella took the medication and was about to leave when she bumped into someone at the door.

"Sorry!" She apologized with her head down and was about to leave when a familiar vroice came from above. "Isabella, what are you doing here?"
###Chapter 79 Isabella Doesn't Like Him

Seeing Isabella standing right in front of him. Ethan couldn't believe his cyes. He was both shocked and thrilled.


Isabella, on the other hand, was taken aback. She squinted at him for a moment before realizing it was Ethan, Michael's buddy.

She always knew Ethan was terrible at keeping secrets. If he blabbed about her visit to the gynecology department, who knew what kind of rumors would start flying?

Before Isabella could come up with an excuse to leave. Michael suddenly showed up right in front of her.

'Didn't he go back to the office? What's he doing here?' Isabella wondered.

Instinctively. she hid the diagnosis paper behind her back, not wanting Michael to see it.

Ethan. clueless about what had just gone down, looked at Michael and said."Michael, why didn't you tell me Isabella was here for a check-up? And in the OB-GYN. Does that mean you two have already..."

Ethan stopped himself just in time, his eyes darting between the two of them.


Isabella shot Ethan a glare. "No! We're divorced. We're strangers now.so watch what you say."

From now on,she and Michael were done. No more contact.

But instead of backing; off, Ethan got even more excited. "Even if you're divorced, you're still Isabella, the heiress of the Wilson Group.We're all
friends here, and this hospital is owned by my family. If you're not feeling well.I can get you the best doctor."

After that, he was about to get a doctor for her. Isabella quickly stopped him,startled.


She forced a smile. "Really, there's no need. I'm just here to get some medicine. It's not serious, but thanks for your kindness."

Even though she and Michael had split. she still treated his friends the same way she used to. She wasn't about to take out her anger on them.
That was her bottom line.

Ethan persisted. "It's okay. My dad is just upstairs; it won't take long."

Isabella shook her head helplessly. "I'm already leaving; it's nothing serious."

She gestured to the medicine box in her hand, which clearly had"emergency contraception" printed on the top left corner.

Michael saw it and his face darkened instantly.

Last night, when they had been intimate, she had softly called his name.and he had felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe she didn't completely hate him;maybe she was just too hurt to care anymore.

But now, he was certain that Isabella didn't like him at all. She was even repulsed by his touch, which was why she had rushed to the hospital for emergency contraception right after their divorce.

Ethan finally stopped trying to find her a doctor and nodded, telling Isabella to take care of herself.
At that moment. Michael stepped forward and blocked her path,his voice low. "Isabella. we're divorced. So, don't come to me with your problems anymore."

Isabella looked at him speechlessly, her mouth twitching. Is there something wrong with him? We're divorced; why would I tell him about my problems? Does he think I have nothing better to do?

Fortunately, they were no longer connected.

She couldn't be bothered to argue with him anymore. "Don't wvorry,my problems have nothing to do with you anymore. You'll never hear about them."


With that, she clenched the medicine in her hand and walked away quickly.

Outside the hospital. Jesse was already waiting, ready to pick her up as soon as she appeared.

Jesse was tall and stood out in the crowd, so Isabella spotted him immediately as she walked out.

As she made her way towards Jesse,someone called out from behind.

"Isabella, can I talk to you for a minute?" Ethan had run over, still catching his breath.

Isabella turned around, puzzled. "What do you need?"

She barely knew Ethan. He was just Michael's longtime friend, and they never included her in their gatherings.

Ethan finally caught his breath. "You know how Michael is. He's got this
weird temper, always keeping things to himself and saying hurtful stuff when he does talk. So. I came to explain on his behalf."

He spoke quickly. as if afraid Isabella would walk away any second.

Isabella was a bit surprised. but when she heard he was there to explain for Michael, her eyes filled with faint sarcasm.

"Ethan.you must have heard earlier that Michael and I are divorced.Given the circumstances. do you think there's any need to explain anything for him?" She didn't give Ethan a chance to respond. She waved him off and quickly walked up to Jesse. linking arms with him.


Jesse gave Ethan a wary glance before protectively escorting Isabella to the car.


Ethan watched their close behavior, coupled with Jesse's earlier warning look.and sighed deeply.

Isabella was now the heiress of the Wilson Group. With her status,how could she lack male attention?

But thinking of Michael's hurt expression earlier,he couldn't help but feel a bit regretful. Were these two really going to part ways just like that?

Meanwhile. Isabella was sitting in the back seat of the Rolls-Royce,resting with her eyes closed.

Jesse could see her fatigue through the rearview mirror, his eyes filled with concern as he quickly started the car and drove away from the hospital.

On the way, he asked softly. "Ms. Taylor, your birthday is in a few days.
Now that your identity is public, Mr. Wilson wants to throw a big party.
What do you think?"
Jesse had been chosen by Daniel to protect Isabella since childhood. He understood her inner fragility and sadness at this moment. Even though he felt for her, he couldn't ask those questions now.

He could only change the subject and talk about her birthday party.

"Whose idea was it?" Isabella still had her eyes closed. looking very tired.

For the past three years, she had been with the Brown Family. unable to show her identity. On her birthday. she could only video call Daniel and receive gifts from her uncles.


This birthday coincided with her identity being revealed. Daniel, feeling sorry for her. wanted to throw a big party to make up for the past three years. which was understandable.

If it were up to her, she would just celebrate quietly in Daniel's ward room.She didn't want her birthday to be too noisy.

But now. Daniel's health was entirely dependent on medication, and she couldn't bear to refuse him.

Daniel probably couldn't handle organizing the birthday party himself,so if he suggested it. someone else must have taken over the task.

"It was Mr. Atticus Wilson!" Jesse responded, looking at the rearview mirror. Isabella nodded, feeling relieved. "SinceAtticus is coming back.let him handle everything. I have no special requests."

Three years ago, she had come to Michael with a passionate heart.believing that her fiery enthusiasm would eventually move him.

Three years later, she not only failed to win Michael's heart but also ended up hurting herself.
Her heart, after years of cold indifference. had become numb.

Now, she only wished for her family's safety and Daniel's health,nothing more.
###Chapter 80 Atticus Returns Home

Meanwhile, at the Wilson Villa, it was unusually lively. a stark contrast to its usual somber atmosphere.


Upon learning that Isabella had been bullied and secretly divorced.Atticus Wilson rushed back from abroad immediately.


His original intention for returning was to throw a grand birthday party for Isabella.


But as soon as he arrived home, he heard about Isabella being bullied.


He immediately contacted his brothers around the world,instructing them to return home without delay.

When Isabella entered the hall. Atticus was on a video call with her other uncles. discussing how to deal with Michael.

Jesse,hearing Michael's name. quickly called out. "Mr. Wilson."

Atticus turned around to see Isabella standing behind him, a look of embarrassment flashing across his usually stern face. He hurriedly ended the call.


After all. the entire Wilson Family knew about Isabella's feelings for Michael.

They were afraid she might soften and stop them from taking action against him.

But this time. Isabella simply said, "Atticus, you want to punish Michael.don't you?"
She had heard their conversation sinceshe came in early and Atticus had his back to her.


Caught red-handed. Atticus had nothing to hide. If Isabella felt sorry for Michael, they could always find another way. But they were not going to let Michael off the hook.


"Isabella, to be honest. I do have that idea." Atticus had a mysterious passion for military affairs from a young age. from serving as a special forces soldier to becoming the second-in-command in the East, even a single look from him usually put his subordinates on high alert.


But even someone as imposing as Atticus felt a twinge of panic under Isabella's questioning.

He truly felt for her; Isabella had endured so much for Michael during the three years. but Michael had only become more outrageous.

He really wanted to teach Michael a lesson.

He had thought about it before, but in the end, it all ended up going nowhere because of Isabella's obstruction.

Unexpectedly, this time. Isabella's pale lips curled up, and she said firmly,"Do whatever you have in mind. This is the outcome I want too."

Michael had hurt her so deeply last night that she needed to vent her anger.

Since Atticus and the others had the same idea, she would leave it all to them.

Atticus was stunned and didn't immediately grasp the meaning of Isabella s words.
Isabella was planning to visit Daniel in the hospital when her phone suddenly beeped with a new message.

It was from someone she had arranged. Opening the message. she saw a photo.

At the bar. Bianca, in a pink dress, was quietly slipping a pill into a drink.whose eyes were filled with smugness and disdain.

Isabella instantly understood. Last night. she had been drugged at Lightning Speed and then taken to a hotel by Michael. It was all Bianca's doing.

No wonder she couldn't figure out who wanted to harm her.

Isabella's grip on her phone tightened, and a sharp glint flashed in her eyes.

Isabella replied directly: [Bring her to our place. I'll be there soon.]

After sending the message.she thought. 'Bianca, you love using these dirty tricks. don't you? Tonight, I'll make you taste your own medicine.'

But to Isabella's surprise, less than half an hour after sending the message.she received a reply:[Bianca is missing.]

Reading this. Isabella narrowed her eyes.

This was Evergreen City, and the Wilsons couldn't just let Bianca disappear right under their noses.

Moreover, Bianca was just a minor celebrity; she couldn't vanish without a trace in a day.

Bianca couldn't have fled alone unless someone was protecting her.
The only person who could rival the Wilson Family and Isabella was Michael.

Indeed, with his status and power in Evergreen City, protecting Bianca would be a piece of cake.


If he could find Bianca, it meant he had already learned about what Bianca had done. Even so, he still wanted to protect Bianca?

Thinking of this, Isabella felt a sharp pain in her heart.

She never thought she would still be compared to Bianca after her divorce.


But in this situation, she could clearly see how heartless Michael was towards her.

Isabella didn't hesitate and called the person from the earlier message.

"Ms. Taylor, please give your orders!" The voice on the other end was extremely respectful and familiar.

Isabella composed herself and instructed, "Get Bianca back and tell him that he can't protect her!"

Daring to bully her like this, did Michael think the Wilsons were easy to mess with?


Drugging Isabella in a nightclub to make her lose face in front of everyone.Bianca's mnalicious intent was obvious.


Bianca wanted to humiliate her publicly, to show her at her worst online.to achieve her goal.

If Isabella didn't personally take revenge, she wouldn't let it go.
Isabella hadn't expected that within half a day, she would be dealing with Michael again, because of Bianca.

Finding Michael's number on her phone. Isabella didn't hesitate and called him directly.

Meanwhile, in an empty warehouse.

Michael, tall and imposing. wore a dark overcoat over a finely tailored three-piece suit. his luxurious attire accentuating his superior physique.

His entire demeanor exuded nobility, showcasing his status and authority.

Michael's eyes were cold and focused on a specific spot.

There were no buildings around. and the inside was empty except for the four iron walls.

The phone rang, its sound echoing clearly.

Seeing Isabella's name on the screen. Michael's sharp eyebrows raised slightly.

He thought. 'Hasn't she promised not to bring her matters to my attention again? How long has it been, and she is already reaching out to me?

His long, strong fingers gripped the phone, and after several seconds of ringing. Michael finally couldn't resist and answered the call.
###Chapter 81 People Disappeared in Evergree City

After answering the call. Michael didn't rush to speak.

Mainly because he didn't know what to say to Isabella. Reaching this point.he admitted he was impulsive and angry with her.

But her affair with Nolan had indeed provoked him.

Michael had things on his mind. but Isabella was already shouting in anger. "Michael, do you think staying silent will cover everything up?Let me ask you. did you take Bianca?"

She was certain that Bianca was with Michael.

Hearing herrevert to her usual tone, Michael felt somewhat relieved.He glanced at the metal door and chuckled softly into the phone. "Ms. Wilson.if I remember correctly, we were just in court four hours ago,and Bianca is your sister. Isn't it absurd to ask me for Bianca?"

Isabella knew Michael's tactics all too well.

She didn't want to waste words with him. "Michael, cut the crap. I must have Bianca. My people have searched all over Evergreen City and found no trace of her. Who else but you could hide her so well?"

She knewbetter than anyone how powerful Michael was.

The Wilson Group almost failed in its expansion into the southern part of Valoria because of him. It he really wanted to go against the Wilson Group.
she wouldn't be able to do anything about it for a while.

But what they were arguing about now wasn't business; it was personal.
She could compromise on other things. but she would never let Bianca go.


Michael neither explained nor admitted. "It seems you have a high opinion of my abilities, but where's your evidence? If you're just going to accuse me based on speculation. I will let the Brown Group's legal team communicate with you."


His words left Isabella speechless. Her anger burned even hotter inside her.and she thought Michael was just being evasive.


Bianca was clearly taken by him. yet he still wouldn't admit it.

"Are you sure Bianca isn't with you?" Isabella questioned him.trying to trick him into revealing the truth.

"Ms. Taylor. are you inquiring about my private life? Do I need to report to you who I'm with?" Michael sneered. "Or do you still think you're Mrs.Brown? We just went through the divorce process. From now on, we're complete strangers. Didn't you say that?"

After saying that. Michael hung up.

Isabella was so angry she almost jumped, realizing his few words could still easily infuriate her.

If she could, she would run to him and bite him hard to vent her anger.But they were already divorced.

However, she couldn't stand it. It was impossible to get the truth from Michael's mouth. The only way was to find him and follow him to Bianca's hiding place.

She had to find Bianca, and not even Michael could stop her.
What Isabella didn't know was that Michael, who had just hung up.stared at his phone for a while before putting away his reluctant expression.

Then he reverted to his usual cold demeanor and walked towards the metal door.


Inside. Bianca was tied to the only chair.

Four men in black stood at each corner. watching her every move.

In such a terrifying scene, Bianca showed no fear. Instead,she shouted loudly in the room.using Michael's name.

She said Michael would kill them all, if they dare to hurt her.

Indeed. this was her true nature.

Michael's narrow eyes squinted slightly, his deep eyes hiding unfathomable emotions.

No one knew what he was thinking at that moment and what he was about to do.

The men in the room. trained by Michael, remained unresponsive no matter how much Bianca shouted.

The sound of high-quality black leather shoes echoed in the room as Michael's tall figure blocked most of the light. Each step he took felt like a demon treading on their hearts.

"Michael." Bianca's voice was already hoarse from shouting.Seeing Michael nowv. she was so scared she couldn't even speak properly.

She had been dragged into an alley and kidnapped just after leaving the mall, thinking it was Isabella's revenge.
So,she had deliberately mentioned Michael's name to scare them and intimidate Isabella.


After all. Isabella cared most about Michael's opinion. With him around.Isabella wouldn't dare do anything to her.

But why was Michael here? Could it be that the people who kidnapped her in the alley weren't Isabella's but Michael's?

Thinking of that. shock and fear gripped her heart. and Bianca couldn't stop trembling.


Her eyes were red. as if she had been wronged.

Before Bianca could speak again, Michael sneered. "What? Don't you recognize me?"


Though familiar. Michael's cold voice sent chills down her spine.

"Michael. Why did you kidnap me?" Bianca said,tears streaming down her face in grievance.


How could he be so heartless? She had loved him for over a decade, yet he kidnapped her for Isabella.

Michael had always been indifferent to her tears. He had only felt he owed her a favor back then, which he had repaid. He hadn't expected she was so greed.

"I made it clear that I would repay your family double for what you did to Isabella. And you keep testing my limits." Michael's eyes swept over her."So. let's start with you."

Bianca shuddered, feeling the warmth drain from her body.
She hadn't forgotten what Michael said in that apartment. but she thought he was just saying it to appease Isabella and wouldni't really kick them out.

She thought those were just words to deal with Isabella, but they were true.

For Isabella. Michael really wanted to take revenge on her family.including her.

Bianca shook her head frantically. "No. Michael. please.let me go this time.Have you forgotten our feelings. and what I did back then..."

"You're not worthy of mentioning what happened back then!" Michael interrupted coldly. "Besides. are you sure it was you who saved me back then?"

Hearing that. Bianca's face turned pale.

Michael's eyes had lost all warmth. "But whether it was you or not doesn't matter to me anymore. I've repaid enough over the years, so don't bring up the past again."
###Chapter 82 Make the Taylor Family Disappear

The thoughts and actions of the Taylor family were not lost on Michael.

He had been holding back from confronting them directly. out of respect for an old favor.

But their greed knew no bounds. Michael had reached his limit.

"You think it's over just because you say so?" Bianca suddenly let out a sarcastic laugh. Just moments ago.she had been playing the pitiful victim, but now her true colors were showing.

No matter how much she pretended. Michael never had any sympathy for her.

She dreamed of having Michael. She loved him so much that she studied abroad for three years just to be worthy of him.

For years, she had catered to his preferences.pretending to be gentle.
However, he still didn't care for her, and he even tied her up for Isabella.

"Michael, don't think you can settle everything just by that. You act like you're blameless, but in the end,you're still left with nothing!" She said smugly, "By the way, have you ever wondered why Isabella was so eager to divorce you? It's because Nolan, is back."

"She never liked you. Once your divorce is finalized,she'll run straight into Nolan's arms and say goodbye to you forever." Bianca had long since figured out Michael's weak spots.

Every word she said was like a sharp blade, stabbing into Michael's heart.

"So what if he's back?" Michael's face darkened, his hands clenched tightly, and he gritted his teeth as he responded.

He couldn't remember when it started,but Isabella had become increasingly important to him. Anything related to her, he couldn't ignore.

His emotions were influenced by her; just the thought
of her being close to someone else made him feel a bloodthirsty rage.

Bianca's face was full of mockery, her laughter wild and unrestrained. "Michael, haven't you figured it out yet? The moment Nolan came back, you were dumped. It shows that Nolan is Isabella's true love,and you are just a stand-in."

As if trying to drag Michael down with her, Bianca continued, "Maybeyou can't possibly not see how much you and Nolan look alike, can you? When you two aren't speaking, you look exactly the same.Isabella was close to Nolan from the start; maybe she mistook you for him..."

The more Bianca spoke, the crazier she became, but soon she couldn't speak at all.

A large hand gripped her neck tightly, the force increasing, and the feeling of suffocation spread through her body.

Bianca opened her mouth but couldn't make a sound,her face turning from blush to pale.
"Mr. Brown, this could kill her!" The bodyguard's reminder snapped Michael back to reality. Seeing Bianca nearly dead in his hands, he released his grip with a dark expression.

He had almost killed the malicious Bianca, but killing her would dirty his hands.

Disgusted, he wiped his palm and coldly ordered,"Send her to Auroria. I don't want to see her again.And make the Taylor Family disappear as well"

He then strode away as if he had never been there.

Bianca, who had just escaped death, collapsed in her chair,terrified to the point of wetting herself upon hearing Michael's orders.

How could he do this to her? A place like Auroria,how could a woman like her survive?

Michael was just trying to scare her; she didn't believe he was that heartless.

"Michael, where are you? I was wrong. I shouldn't have done that to Isabella. Please, don't send me abroad. I'll do anything you want," Bianca, her lips
pale with fear, screamed hysterically towards the door.

Suddenly. a tall shadow blocked the light coming in from outside.


Bianca looked up to see a face with only the eyes exposed, covered by a black cloth.

The man's voice was as cold as a robot's. "Mr. Brown has already left. It's useless to shout."

Hearing that, Bianca was utterly desperate.

When Michael drove back to the city, the streets were already lit with neon lights.

He was extremely agitated. Even he didn't know where this nameless anger came from.

Maybe it was from Bianca's words, or maybe it was because of Nolan, who was always more beloved than him

The car finally drove into the Brown Villa. After a day filled with too many chaotic events, he just wanted to return to the marital home he shared with Isabella and sit quietly for a while.
He didn't want to be disturbed by anyone.

But Michael didn't know that tonight was destined to be anything but ordinary.

Isabella had gone to Michael's apartment and the Taylor Villa to wait for him, but she hadn't seen him.Frustrated, she went directly to the Brown Villa to wait.

She believed Michael would come back.

When she entered the Brown Villa, Aiden had already taken his medication and gone to sleep.

Isabella didn't want to disturb him, nor did she want to face Stella at this time. She sent the servants away and sat alone in the hall to wait.

She thought there was a good chance she wouldn't see Michael tonight, so she was prepared to wait until tomorrow.

But to her surprise, she had only been sitting for a few minutes when Stella approached her with a tea tray.
Stella smiled warmly. "Isabella, you're back so late. Is the company too busy? Here, have some tea to relax.f ve asked the servants to prepare some of your favorite dishes; they'll be ready soon."

Stella personally handed the cup to Isabella, her face maintaining a smile and her voice gentle.

Isabella was stunned.

She thought she was seeing something wrong in the middle of the night. She blinked to make sure she wasn't mistaken. It was indeed Stella in front of her.

Remembering the last incident, Isabella looked at Stella and then at the cup in her hand. She felt Stella was up to something.

Before Isabella could think further, Stella began to explain herself, "Isabella, did I scare you last time at the restaurant? It was all my fault, sorry."

Isabella remained silent, and she didn't expect Stella to apologize to her.

Jsabella didn't know how to address Stella, so she politely put the cup down and, as a junior, asked, "Is
there something you need?"

"Isabella, are you still mad at me?" Stella sighed,wanting to take her hand but afraid of being rejected.Her cautious demeanor was a far cry from her previous arrogance.
###Chapter 83 A Visit in the Night

"About what happened before, it was my fault. I was blinded by outsiders and misunderstood you. Now I see clearly and won't act like that again.From now on. I'll treat you as well as my own daughter. Can you forgive me this once?" Stella's quick change in attitude surprised Isabella.

But with those words. Isabella clearly understood what was going on.

Her true identity had been exposed, and only now did Stella realize who the real heiress was. She was trying to use this opportunity to curry favor with her,hoping to pretend that everything she did before never happened.


Honestly, to secure her position as the hostess of the Brown family, Stella was quite quick to admit her mistakes.


But Isabella wasn't a fool. Stella was delusional if she thought Isabella would forget everything.

Three years of suppression and disdain, and the recent incident, could not be brushed off with a simple apologize.


Isabella couldn't help but sneer. "Mrs. Brown, Michael and I are already in the process of getting a divorce. There's no need for you to say these things to me."


At this point, there was no way she and Michael could be together again.So she wouldn't even bother to look at Stella anymore.


All she wanted now was to corner Michael, find Bianca from him, and settle the matters at hand. Then she would properly settle accounts with him.


Isabella's response was straightforward and blunt, leaving Stella speechless.
She had lowered herself to apologize as an elder, and Isabella didn't even show a bit of gratitude or respect.


Moreover, she had promised to treat her as well as her own daughter in the future.


Who would have thought that Isabella, who used to be treated worse than a servant in the Brown Family, would now dare to confront her publicly?


She wanted to curse back, but thinking of Isabella's current status, Stella could only grit her teeth and swallow her anger.


She silently reminded herself that this was the Wilson Family, which dominated the eastern part of Valoria.


As the heiress of the Wilson Family, it was normal for Isabella to have a bit of a temper.


"Isabella, you and Michael have been married for three years. Any misunderstandings can be cleared up. Why get a dlivorce?" Stella wasn't angry; instead, she smiled and carefully tried to persuade her.


Isabella sneered inwardly, comparing Stella's current expression with the one she had every time she made things difficult for her over the past three years.

To be honest, she was born actors.


"Isn't my divorce with him exactly what you wanted?" Isabella raised her eyebrows and asked.


After all, she had nothing better to do, and having Stella to chat with was a kind of "fun."
"I never thought that. It's you..." Before Stella could finish her sentence. a loud noise came from the entrance of the hall.


A tall figure strode in. and seeing Michael return. Stella's eyes lit up with joy. She no longer had to apologize to Isabella.

"Michael, you're back just in time. Isabella has been waiting for you. You two should sit down and talk things out. Don't make Isabella angry anymore." Stella said this while giving Michael a look.

But this time. Michael seemed to ignore her, and as he got closer., Stella noticed that Michael looked pale and unwell.

Stella was startled. "Michael, what's wrong with you?"

She scanned Michael and quickly noticed a bloodstain on his cuff. "Oh my.you're bleeding. Where did you go so late and get yourself hurt?"


The blood wasn't Michael's; it was from Bianca when he accidentally scratched her neck during his emotional outburst, staining his cuff.

But he couldn't tell Stella about this.

Michael withdrew his hand and calmly replied,"I'm fine, don't worry."

He headed upstairs.

He had naturally seen Isabella, but after what happened last night and their visit to the court for the divorce today, there wasn't much left to say between them.


Especially knowing that the person she was really waiting for was Nolan,he didn't want to hear anything more from her.

But he underestimated Isabella s determination to find Bianca.
She had cornered him at the Brown Villa; there was no way she would let him slip away now.


So when Stella shouted that Michael was hurt. Isabella immediately walked over to him. Of course, not out of concern for him.


"Michael. did you come back so late just to avoid me?" Isabella had hurried over. wearing only a thin long dress. Despite its simplicity,it had an inexplicable allure on her.


Her slender waist and curvy hips were on full display. Michael,having just made love to her, now saw Isabella deliberately blocking his way,provocatively asking if he was avoiding her.

To him, it was an unspoken invitation.

Last night's sex hadn't fully satisfied him. After all, it was her first sex, and he didn't want to scare her.

But he hadn't expected her to come looking for him at night.


Even though he knew her true purpose, he couldn't help but have other thoughts.


Especially with her slender legs right in front of him, he couldn't help but look away and frown.


His voice was low and hoarse. "What are you doing here?"

Seeing that the atmosphere between them wasn't bad, Stella left on her own. This was exactly what Isabella wanted.


She knew how protective Stella was of Michael. If she mentioned Bianca later and Stella caused a scene, it would be disadvantageous for her.

An the mention of last night's madness. Isabella was furious.

He knew she had been drugged. yet after making love, he just left,forcing her oo go to the hospital for medication.


'Michael you bastard. how dare you bring up last night!" Isabella's face turned blush with anger. and she raised her hand to slap him, but Michael was quicker.grabbing her wrist.

She tried to move. but his strength was too much for her.

"Already angry? Weren't you quite enjoy last night." Michael raised his eyebrows. using last night's events to provoke her.
###Chapter 84 In Your Eyes, What Am I?

Isabella was furious, unable to move her hands, but she could move her legs.

Michael, however. saw through her intentions first and directly touched her leg. Isabella, disgusted, stepped back and almost fell.

Michael grabbed her. "You're so eager, it seems I was right."

Isabella remained silent. thinking Michael's mind was filled with sex.

She couldn't fall into his trap. She forcefully pulled her wrist from his hand,took a deep breath, and confronted him, "Michael, you know what I want to ask. Bianca is with you.isn't she?"


After the air froze for a moment, Michael's deep eyes stared at her.′′Yes.′′

At this moment, Michael didn't want to lie to her anymore, when he looked into her eyes.


The reason they had come to this point might be because he wasn't honest enough with her.

But what Michael didn't know was that his lack of concealment, not even a single extra word. hurt her even more.

He knew how the Taylors bullied her.

Last night. Bianca drugged her, and today he hid Bianca,which showed that he was aware of everything. But now he didn't even bother to hide his protection of Bianca. Did he care about Bianca that much?

Thinking of this, Jsabella's heart ached, and her eyes welled up with tears.
Michael had shattered the last bit of hope she had for him.

If she could. she really wanted to get an answer from his mouth.

Since Bianca's position in his heart was unshakable. Then what was she?A stranger he had sex with?


But she couldn't bring herself to ask. All she had left was her pitiful yet strong self-esteem.


The pride of Isabella had been worn away the day she willingly married Michael.

Now,she couldn't let herself be hurt a second time.

She bit her lip, and when she looked up again, her eyes were devoid of any emotion. only coldness from a broken heart.


"Hand over Bianca, and we're even!" She didn't care what Michael would do.but she had to take Bianca away today.

"No way!" Michael glanced at his watch, his tone firm and non-negotiable.

By this time. Bianca was no longer within Evergreen City; she was on a plane to Auroria.

He never intended to let Isabella handle this matter.


Bianca's current fate was what she deserved. Someone like Bianca, he would deal with; Isabella shouldn't be involved.


Throwing Bianca to Auroria, whether she lived or died was her fate.

"Why not?" Seeing his serious expression, Isabella's heart ached,and she sneered. "Just because she's the one you like, you hide her without a
second thought. What about me? What am I in your eyes?"

Isabella took a deep breath. She didn't want to tell him, but she couldn't hold it in anymore. "Michael. you must know what Bianca did. Last night at the nightclub. she dared to drug me. Do I need to explain her intentions? If I had encountered someone else, what would my fate have been? You can imagine it! She wanted me dead and to use my disgrace as a lifelong joke. As my husband, what were you doing? Protecting her?Why. Michael. why do you back her up when she does wrong, and I have to endure it just because she's the one you like and I'm the one you don't care about? Michael. you two are simply too much!"

Isabella's chest heaved with anger, her eyes reddened with fury.Thinking about how she could have been taken away by any man last night,she couldn't suppress her anger and slapped Michael hard.

She hated Michael. and she hated Bianca even more, so she wouldn't let them go.


Caught off guard. her slap landed squarely on his face, quickly leaving a clear red handprint.

The crisp sound of the slap echoed through the hall.

Isabella still felt unsatisfied and was about to raise her hand again when Michael, with a dark expression, stopped her, grabbed her, and carried her upstairs.


In their marital bedroom. Michael closed the door behind him, and Isabella was thrown onto the bed.


In the silent, dark room, Isabella clutched her aching shoulder and met Michael's bloodshot, furious eyes, mocking him, "It seems Bianca's skills
aren't that great. Do you still have the energy to make love to me again?"

Isabella deliberately spoke provocatively.

But their eyes were filled with anger and hatred. with no hint of intimacy.


She wanted to humiliate him. Only by seeing his anger could she feel a sense of satisfaction. even wanting to clap and laugh.


Michael's face was dark. his whole body exuding a terrifying pressure. He walked step by step towards Isabella on the bed, pulling off his tie and unbuttoning his shirt.


He seemed to get into the mood in an instant, casually throwing his clothes to the floor, and pressed his bare chest against her.

"We've been married for three years, and you never managed to have sex with me. Now that we're getting divorced, I naturally have to satisfy you properly.give you a perfect experience." Michael's voice was dangerously low. but his hands didn't stop.


He pressed her body that was trying to escape, his eyes lingering on her,and his words were merciless. "Otherwise, if you're still a virgin after the divorce, it would be too embarrassing for me."

Saying this, he pressed her body and leaned in to kiss her.

"Michael, get off me!" Isabella refused to let him touch her, struggling with all her might under Michael. "I'd rather pay a male escort than be with you. So what if you're Mr. Brown? A hypocritical, dirty-minded man like you.I even want to throw you away."


"Hypocritical. dirty-minded?" Michael gritted his teeth, repeating her words.pressing her with one hand and tearing her dress with the other. "Then T'
11 show you just how dirty my mind can be!"

"Michael. you bastard, don't touch me."

"No way!" Michael propped himself up beside her, his muscular upper body taut. blood rushing to his lower body. "You weren't satisfied last night, tonight I won't let you go!"

Isabella was left in just her underwear, and as Michael's hand was about to tear it off, a heavy knock came from the door outside. "Michael, I heard Isabella's voice. Is she back?"
###Chapter 85 Are You Capable or Not?

Aiden's voice came from outside, but Michael couldn't hold back any longer.

The door was locked from the inside. He looked at Isabella, who was barely covered by a piece of fabric, his eyes filled with an overwhelming desire that seemed ready to devour her.

"Isabella. I have gave you a chance, but you came to me. So, are you going to do it yourself, or should I?" His voice was hoarse to the extreme, but he wouldn't let go anymore.

Meeting Michael's predatory gaze. Isabella tensed up, feeling a faint pain somewhere in her body.

"Michael, you are really a bastard. If you love sex so much, go find Bianca.Don't touch me!" She was hurt so badly last night that she could barely walk. He couldn't possibly be unaware of her condition, yet not even a day had passed, and he dared to do that again. He was a complete madman.

Without waiting for an answer, Michael didn't give her any more chances.

His long fingers unhooked her bra, and her breasts bounced free, swaying in front of Michael. Especially with the bite marks he had left still visible.

Michael's eyes darkened, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swiftly pinned Isabella's hands above her head, his possessive gaze no longer hidden."Jsabella, you can't escape tonight."

"Michael, you lunatic, you're a pervert! Grandpa is right outside. Let me go." Isabella resisted, and as Michael pressed down on her, she bit his collarbone hard.
Michael grunted, showing no more mercy, and forcefully entered her.

His movements grew faster, and stormy kisses rained down on Isabella.

Isabella trembled in pain. going from cursing to crying.

Aiden. not hearing a response. was about to return to his room when he heard Isabella's muffled sobs and the increasing commotion inside.

Aiden's face darkened, and he turned to shout at the door, "Michael, come out! Isabella is your wife. How can you treat her like this?"

"Michael, you're crazy! Do you want Isabella to hate you?" No matter how much Aiden shouted. Michael inside showed no signs of stopping, instead becoming even more relentless.

Let her hate him, then.

Although she would hate him then, she belonged to him at least at this moment.


Isabella's hair was disheveled, her lips swollen, her eyes wet with silent tears.and her body stiff.


Michael felt the tightness beneath him, and her lack of cooperation made him uncomfortable too.


After last night's experience, he knew every inch of Isabella's body.

He withdrew and replaced himself with his fingers, mimicking his earlier movements inside her.


A moan escaped, and Isabella, in disbelief, covered her mouth tightly.

Sensing danger, Isabella struggled to resist. "Michael, get off me. Take your
filthy hands away. You make me sick."


Isabella lay beneath him, her strength like cotton to the towering Michael.As she lifted her legs. Michael pulled her closer.

He flipped her over and entered from behind.


A more intense pain shot through her, making Isabella feel like she was being torn apart.


Her tears flowed uncontrollably, and she didn't know if it wras from the immense humiliation or the physical pain.

She shouted,"Michael. I won't let you get away with this! You better wait.If I can't fight you. the Wilson Family will. I will make you pay dearly for today."


She wanted him to feel a hundred times the pain she felt, only then could she ease her hatred.


She was a heiress of the Wilson Family. How could she be humiliated like this?


But then. a threatening chuckle came from behind her, slowly reaching her ears. "Angering me now, what good does it do you? If I were you, I would be to relax and enjoy the pleasure like last night."


Michael's hand, like magic, caressed her smooth back, planting kisses on her shoulders.


Michael's anger had dissipated with their intimate entanglement.

His tone and actions became unintentionally gentle, luring her to follow his rhythm. "Isabella, I know you like it. Don't hold back."
But to Isabella, this was just Michael's tactic toget her. She would rather he be as rough as before.


Let her body remember this torment, this pain, and sever all her fantasies about him.


"How do you know I like it? Yesterday, I. was just following my body's instincts. It doesn't mean I'll feel the same today!" Isabella buried her face in the pillow. sneering. "Michael, this is your second time having sex, and you're still so clumsy. Was that your first sex too last night?"

Hearing that. Michael's body stiffened slightly.

Isabella seemed to guess something, turning her head to look at Michael's darkened face, and couldn't help but smirk. "Really? Mr. Brown, the man every woman in Evergreen City wants to be with, almost thirty and still a virgin?"


Michael pulled her up, making her sit on him, letting her feel for herself."What do you think?"

She looked at his cold face, her fingers lifting his chin, deliberately saying."I don't remember last night, but today, I'll see if you can prove yourself."


Michael's large hand pressed her waist down, but the more he wanted to prove his perform, the more he seemed stimulated, ending quickly.


Isabella burst into laughter. "So it's true. Mr. Brown really can't do it.Looks like I made the right choice to divorce. You should take better care of your health. Being so young and already having performance issues."

Grabbing this handle, Isabella felt much better.

But she underestimated Michael's pride in this aspect
Seeinng Isabella laughing on the bed, Michael's eyes narrowed,desire and anger rising within him, surging towards a certain part of his body.


Noticing Isabella trying to escape, Michael grabbed her ankle,pulling her beneath him. firmnly holding her waist, and thrusting into her.


Isabella gasped in surprise, "Michael. you..."

Michael. satisfied with her reaction, bit her ear. "The night is long.Whether I can do it or not, you can conclude after we're done."
###Chapter 86 Does it hurt?

Another night of wild debauchery, and this time Michael seemed determined to prove something, gripping her waist and making love to her over and over again.

In the end, she passed out.

The next day. Isabella got out of bed. feeling nothing but pain all over her body.

Michael had either bitten or gnawed at her, treating her like a piece of meat.


'That bastard Michael has gotten his way again!' Isabella cursed in her head.


And she clearly remembered that Michael, to punish her, hadn't used a condom the last few times. They had already signed the divorce papers,and if she got pregnant...

No,she absolutely couldn't have Michael's child.

Just then, her phone rang from the floor. Her clothes from yesterday had been torn to shreds by Michael, and her phone had naturally been thrown to the ground.

Isabella practically crawled off the bed to reach her phone. When she opened it,she saw countless missed calls.

Seeing the top one was from Jesse, she snapped out of her daze and answered the call.

Meanwhile, the missing Michael was kneeling obediently in Aiden's study,
waiting to be reprimanded..

Michael had always been difficult to discipline since he was a child, so seeing him kneel so obediently was quite rare.

But Aiden was even angrier seeing him like this.

If Michael weren't his grandson, he would have disappeared from Evergreen City by now.


But precisely because Michael was his grandson, this beating was unavoidable.


Thinking about the marks he saw on Michael's body that morning, Aiden's anger flared up, and he lashed out at Michael's back with a whip.

Aiden was so furious that he didn't hold back at all.

He struck several times in a row, but Michael didn't make a sound.

It was only when Aiden himself got tired that he had to stop, leaning on a chair and pointing at Michael's forehead, questioning, "Do you know what you did wrong?"

Michael looked up, his deep eyes meeting Aiden's. "I did nothing wrong."

Isabella was his wife. Whether they divorced or not..

Hearing this, Aiden nearly fainted, slamming his hand on the table.

"Michael,you know Isabella's background, and you stil treat her like this.
How am I supposed to explain this to Daniel?"


Michael didn't respond directly. Despite having just endured a beating, his eyes showed no other emotion. "Grandpa, if you're done hitting me,I
should go check on Isabella. She should be awake by now."

Seeing Michael's unyielding attitude. Aiden was almost driven mad with anger.


But this was ultimately a matter for the younger generation, not something he could resolve with his words.


Helpless. Aiden sighed, closed his eyes, and dismissed him. "Get out.Fix your own mistakes and make sure Isabella isn't upset."


In the room. Isabella ended her call with Jesse and pulled back the covers to check her lower body.


She remembered that the doctor at the hospital had subtly advised her not to have sex for a while, or she would suffer.


It had only been a day, and Michael had already hurt her again.

The marks on her body were a mix of old and new, bruises and Michael's handprints on her waist.


She was so badly hurt that she thought her waist might break, but compared to the injuries below, these were minor.


She carefully spread her legs. and just one look made her bite her lip. Her vagina was swollen and red from Michael's torment, and with pain inside.


She couldn't even walk, let alone get out of bed.

Feeling miserable, humiliated, and all sorts of emotions flooded her heart.and Isabella's tears fell uncontrollably.

They dripped onto her legs and then onto the sheets, soaking them.
Isabella hugged herself and started to cry.

She hated herself for not listening to Daniel and her uncles, for insisting on marrying Michael. naively thinking he would fall in love with her.Marrying him was a mistake from the start.


Outside. Michael put the anti-inflammatory ointment in his pocket and pushed the door open.


But at this moment. Isabella didn't want to deal with him at all. Just thinking about last night made her feel humiliated,so she turned away from him.


But Michael seemed determined to confront her. Wherever she looked,he stood in front of her.


Michael knew Aiden wouldn't let this go. so he had barely slept and got up early.


He had already changed into a black shirt and matching trousers that suited his demeanor. His tall figure stood in front of her, backlit, creating an imposing presence without saying a word.

Isabella felt uncomfortable under his gaze but didn't want to talk to him.

She forced herself to endure the discomfort and avoided looking at him.


Michael was a demon; nothing good ever came from being around him.She could only avoid him to stay unaffected.


Michael, however, slowly squatted in front of her, his eyes deep as he looked at her. "Are you in pain?"

Isabella didn't believe he would be so kind as to care about her.
Last night was her first sex, and her body was already uncomfortable. He hadn't been gentle, and now. with new injuries on top of old ones,how could she not be in pain?


After doing what he did, now he wanted to show concern? What was the point?

Isabella remained silent. her hands tightly gripping the sheet covering her.She wasn't wearing anything underneath and didn't want any more contact with him.


She thought he would leave sensibly, but Michael extended his long arm.scooped her up. and carried her into the bathroom.


In front of the large floor mirror. Isabella's delicate body was nestled against Michael's chest, her hands loosely draped over his shoulders.

Neither of them spoke or made eye conact.

The room was so quiet that only their breathing could be heard.

Looking in the mirror, their bodies were closely pressed together,appearing very intimate. Michael's tall frame enveloped her petite one.making them look like a perfect match.

But just as this thought crossed her mnind, Isabella quickly dismissed it.

She must be crazy to think she and Michael were a good match.

Neither of them spoke. Isabella looked at Michael in the mirror and couldn't help but sneer, "Mr. Brown, do you think last night wasn't exciting enough? Do you want to try something different in the bathroom this morning?"
Michael's eyes darkened. and he looked down at her strained expression.raising an eyebrow. "If you want to make love here, that's fine too."


Without giving her a chance to refuse, he carried her to the sink, sat her on it. and positioned his knees between her legs, reaching to remove her covering.


Michael always did what he said. Seeing him like this, Isabella thought he was goinng to force himself on her again, and she bit her lip and pushed him away hard. "Get away. Michael, you're a bastard!"


Isabella never expected that even in her current state, Michael would still make love with her.
###Chapter 87 See a Urologist

But she couldn't match Michael's strength. Her vigorous struggle was quickly subdued by Michael, and the fabric covering her body was torn down to her legs.


The thought of having to go through sex again made Isabella tense up all over.


She instinctively crossed her arms over her breast and shouted at Michael,"Michael, you're too much! You're torturing me to extrem, and you still want to act like a beast in heat?"


Michael reached out with his large hand, and Isabella struggled desperately.


"Stop it. Let me check your injury and apply some medicine." His voice was calm, but his tone was imperiously unyielding.


His long fingers on Isabella's delicate skin lightened their pressure, but Isabella no longer had any trust in him. She didn't want to let him have his way again. "I don't need your help. Go away."




11


Isabella tried to block his actions, but the movement pulled at her wound,causing her to cry out in pain.

Michael's eyes darkened as he held her hands down to check her injury.

Her legs were pinned by his knee, making it impossible for Isabella to close them.


The sheet covering her was removed by Michael, exposing the red and
swollen area. On closer inspection, there seemed to be a tear with traces of blood seeping out.


Michael's gaze darkened, and his lips pressed into a tight line.

Isabella was scared by his stare. After Michael's crazed demands last night.she was truly afraid of that look in his eyes.


"I don't need you to apply medicine. Go away. I don't want to see you again." Before Isabella could step down to the floor, Michael scooped her up and carried her out of the room, placing her on the bed.


Michael handed her clean clothes. "Come with me to the hospital."

He had been too rough during sex last night, inevitably causing her injury.

"No!" Isabella refused without thinking. She had only one thought now,which was to stay away from Michael.


Besides, she had just gone to the hospital yesterday. If she went again today,anyone could guess what she had been through.


She didn't want to experience that kind of awkward situation a second time.


Michael grabbed her wrist, half-threatening and half-coaxing, "If you don't go to the hospital, then I'll personally apply the medicine for you. With such a deep wound, it will take at least half an hour."

"Michael, don't you dare!" Knowing what he was up to again, Isabella's face turned blush with anger.


Seeing her angry, flushed face, Michael's lips curled into a wicked smile.He propped himself up on either side of her, trapping her beneath him.
and whispered in her ear."Why wouldn't I dare? Can you say you didn't enjoy it last night?"

"I didn't!"

"Really?"

"Then who was crying and moaning on me in the middle of the night,saying no with your mouth but clinging to me,asking for it again and again?" Michael's voice. perhaps recalling last night's scene, was filled with a satisfied and hoarse tone of post-coital contentment.

"Stop talking nonsense!" Isabella's face heated up, not realizing Michael was so shameless as to bring this up openly.

"Then you admit you enjoyed it," Michael added

Isabella fell silent.

Last night. he had deliberately aroused her desires, coaxing her into having sex repeatedly, bullying her, and ignoring her pleas to stop.

"Madman!" Isabella tried to push him away but accidentally met Michael's deep eyes, which suddenly turned sharp.

"Isabella, until we are completely divorced, don't let me find out you have any physical contact with another man. If you dare to have sex with someone else. I'll make sure he wishes he were dead." Michael's gaze at her was filled with a bloodthirsty intensity. "Given my obsession with your body. I might just tie you to the bed and show you what it really means to be unable to get out of bed."

Hearing that, Isabella's heart trembled violently.
Last night's experience was already painful enough. With Michael's madness. she would surely die in bed.


"And stop taking birth control pills. Isn't having my child what you've always wanted? Now I agree, so stop pretending. With a child, Grandpa 呂  will be happy too. Don't you want to fulfill his wish?"

Isabella felt a pang in her heart.

Daniel had mentioned the idea of having a child more than once. He was sick now, and seeing her with a child was his greatest wish in life.


Her uncles were all unmarried and lived far away. She had lost her mother's love at a young age, and Daniel feared that if he passed away unexpectedly,she would lose her emotional support, and her child would be her anchor and her closest relative.


These were indeed things Isabella had once wanted the most-to have a child with Michael and fulfill Daniel's wish.


But now everything had changed, she didn't even want Michael anymore,let alone his child.


Isabella habitually retorted, "Just because we've had sex a few times, you're sure I'll get pregnant? Mr. Brown, did you forget how it went last night? If you have time, I suggest you go to the hospital and get checked out.Maybe you have some hidden health issues, which is why your performance in bed is so poor."


With that, Isabella quickly changed her clothes and left the room, without giving Michael a chance to grab her.

But while she avoided Michael, she couldn't avoid Stella.
Isabella awkwardly walked to the hall, enduring her discomfort, and was about to leave when Stella took a bowl of soup from a servant and walked towards her with a smile. "Isabella. you look so pale. You must be exhausted. Here. have some soup. Maybe there will be good news next month."


The noise from their lovemaking last night was so loud that even Aiden had come over.


Now, probably everyone in the Brown Villa knew what she and Michael had done last night.

Looking at the soup in front of her. Isabella was speechless.

'Michael. that bastard, has ruined myreputation and made things so awkward.' Isabella thought.

But Stella didn't see it that way.

She had learned about Isabella's background and was worried about how to persuade Isabella to come back. She hadn't expected that the two would end up having sex last night. If Isabella got pregnant, she would definitely stay.

Considering Isabella's background and influence. Stella had to keep her happy.


Before Isabella could react, Stella took the initiative to pick up the spoon and pulled Isabella to sit on the couch.


She "considerately" reminded Isabella, "You're not in good health. If you want to get pregnant, you need to eat more. Stay here for now. and I'll make delicious food for you every day."
Isabella's face remained cold, not taking in a word Stella said.

She only thought, 'Did Michael's coercion last night count as a crime? If I call the cop, could Michael be sent to jail?
###Chapter 88 Contraception

The thought had just emerged when Isabella cut it off.

Not to mention that with Michael's power, this little matter wouldn't even require his team of lawyers.

If this matter got out. she would be the first to suffer.

Michael might not care. but she needed to save face.

Indeed, she was too easily swayed. Michael was right about one thing: she did feel comfortable in the latter half of the night.


With a sigh. Stella had already handed the soup to Isabella, who instinctively blocked it. "I don't want it. thank you."


Isabella had just refused when she looked up and saw Michael coming down the stairs.


Michael stood on the stairs, watching Isabella frown as she rejected Stella's kindness. He was about to get angry, but then he thought of her injuries and her pale face, feeling a bit of pity.


He simply walked over, took the bowl from Stella, and forcibly placed it in front of Isabella. "Mom worked hard to make this. Take it."


Isabella only wanted to sneer at Michael's attitude, thinking the mother and son were as unlikable as ever.


Did she have to give face just because Stella made the soup?What about the countless times Stella had trampled on her dignity over the past three years? Why didn't he stand up for her then?
And Stella's hard work, what did that have to do with her? It was not like she forced Stella to make it.


She didn't even look at the soup, stood up straight, and coldly looked at Michael. "I said I don't want it. Don't you understand?"

"Don't forget we've already signed the divorce agreement. So I have no obligation to obey you mom." She didn't want to go against her own will anymore, nor did she want to stay in this house for another minute.


She didn't want to say anything harsher. letting this farce between them end here.


As for Bianca. she would use her own power to find her. Evergreen City wasn't that big; she didn't believe she couldn't find Bianca by searching the whole city.


At this moment.Jesse had already entered the hall with the butler.

He immediately noticed Isabella standing opposite Michael. She looked pale, her hair was messy, and her body was visibly weak.

"Ms. Taylor. are you alright?" Jesse quickly walked over to support the unsteady Isabella. He didn't need her to say much; he could guess what had happened.


Seeing Isabella trustingly hand herself over to Jesse, Michael's eyes turned cold, and he looked at Jesse with hostility.


Jesse didn't care about his reaction; he only felt sorry for Isabella's plight."Mr. Brown, Ms. Taylor just spent one night at the Brown Villa, and you tortured her like this. You're too much."

"T Wilson Family won't let this go, but right now, I can't wait for them to
step in." Jesse turned and threw a punch. He had protected Isabella for over ten years and couldIn't let her be bullied like this.

"Jesse!" Isabella called out.

Jesse was the best person Daniel had chosen from thousands. Being an orphan himself. he had always protected Isabella as the most important person under Daniel's instructions.

Now,seeing Isabella bullied by Michael like this, he couldn't hold back.

He moved too quickly. and Isabella was too late to stop him.

But unexpectedly, Michael caught Jesse's punch and twisted his wrist.

For a moment. Michael had the upper hand.

Isabella saw the anger in Michael's eyes.

Enduring the pain in her body, she walked up to the two and ordered."Jesse.let's go."

Jesse was full of anger. but when he turned and saw Isabella's pale face,he had to withdraw his hand.


He supported Isabella as they wwalked out. Before leaving, he didn't forget to warn Michael. "Michael, the Wilson Family will take action.You better be ready!"


Isabella got into Jesse's car without looking back.

In the car, Jesse looked at Isabella curled up in the back seat,feeling heartbroken. Thinking about the scene he had witnessed, he wished he could go back and beat Michael up again.
Michael was Isabella's husband, someone she had liked for years. How could he bully her like this?

What kind of miserable life had Isabella been living these past three years?

G The more Jesse thought about it, the angrier he got, his face turning blush.

Isabella gently advised. "Jesse, there's no need to fight him. We've already filed for divorce; we won't have any more ties."


In her mind. Jesse had always been a quiet person, only appearing when she needed him.


Even when she was framed by Bianca and sent to the police station,he hadn't been this angry.

This time, he must be really furious.

But she couldn't tell him the truth. Given Jesse's level of protection for her.he would definitely send Michael to the police station. That would really disgrace the Wilson Family and Daniel.

Jesse had no good feelings towards Michael, his chest heaving. "Ms. Taylor,we can't let him off this time. Even if you're divorced. you are still his ex-wife.What he did clearly shows no respect for the Wilson Family!"

Isabella said nothing more.

Michael didn't just disrespect the Wilson Family; he didn't respect her either.


But what made her feel wronged was his unchanging attitude.

Even Stella, upon learning she was a Wilson, had changed her arrogant attitude of three years and spoke to her cautiously.
Only he. from beginning to end. whether she was an ordinary person or a rich lady, never saw her as important.

All in all, it was because he didn't love her that he didn't care.


"Jesse. I don't want to hear his name again. Also. don't tell Atticus and the others aabout today." Just thinking about Michael made her heart ache.

She really didn't want these things to reach the Wilson Family.

Seeing Isabella's poor complexion. Jesse opened his mouth but swallowed his words. first taking her back to the Garden Villa left by Grace.


After a hot bath. Isabella simply cleaned herself and lay on the bed, not wanting to move.


She had just washed with hot water. and the discomfort had eased a lot.but it still hurt.


Compared to that, she seemed to have forgotten something important.contraception.


Isabella suddenly sat upin bed. ignoring the soreness in her body, and went downstairs to find the medicine in her bag.


The doctor had given her the medicine yesterday. and fearing it wouldn't be enough, she had asked for two boxes. There was still one unopened box.

She had just found the medicine when a white tube of ointment fell out of her bag.


Puzzled. she picked it up and saw it was the same thing Michael had in his hand in the bathroom.


Michael had wanted to apply the ointment for her, but it was still
unopened.

Isabella bit her lip. Although she didn't want to accept Michael's kindness,it was unrealistic for her to go out and buy medicine in her current condition.


She was also too embarrassed to ask someone else to buy it for her.

Taking a deep breath. Isabella resignedly opened the ointment and went to the bathroom.


After applying the ointment, the cool sensation relieved most of the pain.

Lying back on the bed, Isabella was so tired she could barely keep her eyes open. But when she turned her head, she saw the box of contraceptive pills on the bedside table.
###Chapter 89 Midnight Movie

Michael's words in their wedding room echoed in her mind.

Not long after she got married. Daniel mentioned that he wanted her and Michael to have a child.


At that time, she still had feelings for Michael. and Daniel's illness wasn't
that severe yet. She could easily brush it off with an excuse.

But now Daniel was in the hospital, his health deteriorating, and his
greatest wish was to see Isabella's child. So Isabella had to consider this.

Michael had been making love to her frequently these past few days. What if she got pregnant?

Actually, it didn't matter who the father was; she just wanted the child.

If she got pregnant this time, it would satisfy her urgent desire to have a child and save her the trouble of finding someone else.

But this child would be a Brown.

But this child would be a Brown. Michael alone was enough to give her a headache, let alone Aiden, who cherished her the most in the Brown Family.

If Aiden found out she had a Brown Family child, he definitely wouldn't let her go easily.

She picked up the medicine and then put it down. Isabella finally made a decision in her heart.


If she really had a child, she could secretly give birth to it without anyone
knowing, so Michael wouldn't be able to find her.

That way, she could also give Daniel an explanation.

But thinking about why she sought out Michael last night made Isabella E furious.

Michael's attitude yesterday was very clear. Bianca was in his hands, but he wouldn't release her. Nor would he hand Bianca over to her.


Thinking of this, Isabella made a call and instructed her people to continue searching for Bianca's whereabouts in Evergreen City.

Bianca was in Michael's hands; she didn't believe she couldn't find her.

But what Isabella didn't expect was that after several days, no matter how her people searched, Bianca seemed to have vanished from Evergreen City.

Isabella was very angry. She knew the problem lay with Michael, but she couldn't do anything about it.


Just thinking about it, he had a hundred ways to prevent her from finding anyone.

While Isabella was feeling distressed, Olivia called.

It was as if she knew how Isabella was feeling, inviting her out to have fun."Isabella, there's a great movie coming out recently. Let's go watch it tomorrow night,okay?"


Before Isabella could speak, she heard Olivia deliberately lower her voice."It's the latest show, and there are lots of handsome guys around. You'll be satisfied."


Hearing this, Isabella's mouth twitched. "Those handsome guys must go
with their girl friends at this time. We'll be the only two single people there."


Olivia was stunned for a moment, feeling very innocent. "But the movie is really good, and it's the premiere. It stars my favorite actor, and I R promised him I'd support this film."


Towards the end, Olivia started to act coquettishly towards Isabella. "Please,日  Isabella,come with me. If I go alone, everyone will laugh at me."

Isabella couldn't resist her coquettishness. Since she had nothing else to do,she said, "Fine. I'll go, but I'll wear my usual clothes and won't puat on makeup."

That night at the club had really left a shadow on her.

Whenever she thought of that makeup, she remembered the night she made love with Michael in the hotel.


"No problem, you are stunning even without makeup." As long as she could get Isabella out, Olivia was more than happy.

The next day, Isabella arrived at the cinema Olivia mentioned twenty minutes early.


She wore a white coat and casual pants, her hair simply tied back, and a baseball cap, looking like a college girl sneaking out to have fun.


But Isabella waited at the entrance for a long time, and Olivia, who had invited her out, was nowhere to be seen.


Seeing that the time was almost up, Isabella called Olivia in exasperation."Olivia, what are you up to? Didn't we agree to watch the movie together? It's about to start, where are you?"
"I'm almost there, Isabella, don't worry." Olivia was panting, running as she apologized to Isabella.′′Ijust put on some makeup and lost track of time. Believe me, it wasn't on purpose."

Listening to the voice on the phone, it seemed like Olivia was right behind her.


She instinctively turned around, and sure enough, Olivia was not far away.running towards her and waving. "Isabella, I'm here!"


Seeing she really arrived, Isabella didn't even know where to start scolding her.


Hanging up, Olivia immediately ran over and linked arms with Isabella,looking up with her delicate face. "I wasn't lying, see, I made it just in time."


Isabella said, "Yes, if you were a few minutes later, the movie would have
started, and we'd go straight to the best part."

Olivia,knowing she was in the wrong, blinked her eyes,seeking forgiveness.


Isabella smiled, pulling her along. "Let's go in, or we'll really be late."

But Olivia noticed something was off and asked as they walked, "Isabella,do you have a cold? Why are you all bundled up? This isn't like your style!"


Indeed,she had deliberately dressed like this, but she couldn't let Olivia find out.


That lunatic Michael, who knew what was wrong with him, had bitten and marked her all over.
Not only did he leave marks all over her, but these marks seemed to linger on her body for days.

Even wearing high-necked clothes couldn't cover them.

2To prevent Olivia from noticing, she had to wear a scarf. After all, it was a movie theater at night, so she might not be discovered.

The mask was because she hadn't put on makeup, so she decided to cover her face.


Olivia couldn't keep a secret, and she was really afraid she'd tell Thomas.

"No. It's just that the news online has been too crazy lately, and people keep following me. This is more convenient. Let's go in." Isabella hurriedly pulled her towards the entrance, but this only piqued Olivia's curiosity.


"No way, you usually don't care about reporters. Why are you hiding today.and wearing a scarf that doesn't match your style? This looks so strange."


"Don't..." Isabella quickly covered her neck, but it was too late. Olivia had already grabbed the other end of the scarf and with a gentle tug, it fell off.


"Olivia, what are you doing!" Isabella's voice suddenly rose in panic,and she quickly re-tied the scarf around her neck before Olivia could react.

But she didn't know that Olivia had already seen the scene just now.

The area near her collarbone was covered in love marks.

"Isabella, are you hiding something from me?" Olivia squinted her eyes,her gaze fixed on Isabella's neck, pretending to be unaware.
###Chapter 90 Did Michael put a tracker on he

"No. what could I possibly be hiding from you? You're overthinking it."Isabella adamantly denied it.


Olivia raised an eyebrow but didn't press the issue. Instead,she waved the tickets in her hand. "Let's go. it's time to check in. We can talk inside."


'Could the traces Isabella doesn't want me to see be related to Michael? No wonder she left so early that day.' Olivia thought to herself.


Before entering the venue. Isabella noticed that Olivia seemed different.Usually. when Olivia went out. she wore heavy makeup.following her own whims.


But tonight, Olivia looked like she was rushing to an event. with her makeup meticulously done and her outfit matching her public persona in the entertainment industry.

But it was just a late-night movie, no need to be so formal.

"Olivia, is someone special coming tonight?" Isabella looked at her in confusion. thinking tonight's movie was just Olivia's way of killing time.


But Olivia replied casually, "No. I'm just here to support my favorite star's box office. Plus, I know the male lead, he's super handsome, so I brought you along to enjoy it."

"If it's to support him, why not just book thewhole theater?"

Olivia was the heiressof the Smith Family, and Isabella was the biggest shareholder of both the Wilson Group and the Brown Group.Why squeeze into a late-night movie with just two tickets?
"That's different. If I booked the whole theater. I wouldn't run into that person!"

Isabella was taken aback. "Who?"

Olivia leaned in. "I had someone find out that the investor behind this movie will be here with friends for this late-night movie . You know I've always wanted to try my hand in the movie industry, but good resources are scarce. I have to seize the opportunity."


"Now you know why I dragged you here at this time?" Olivia raised her eyebrows with a meaningful expression.


Isabella understood. Olivia had always been interested in acting, but good resources required more than just money; they needed connections.


"You should have told me earlier. I wouldn't have dressed like this.I would have worn something decent to not embarrass you," Isabella said.


She almost covered herself up completely when she came. It was easy for her to be seen as an oddball.


"Well, Isabella, you look good in anything. Tonight, just think of it as keeping me company. Don't overthink it."

Once inside, Olivia pulled her to their seats.

The lights dimmed shortly after, and the big screen started to flicker.

But in the vast space, it was just the two of them.

Isabella wasa bit surprised and asked Olivia, "That person you mentioned isn't coming, right? The movie's started, and no one else has come in."

Olivia wasn't too sure either. After all, the information was bought, but
since they were already there, they could only sit tight. "They'll come.I paid for this info; it can't be wrong."


Just as she finished speaking, a group of people entered from the doorway.too dark to see clearly.


But the lead figure was distinguishable. with a perfect build and proportions.


"They're here. that's the person." Olivia's excited voice came from beside her,making Isabella's heart skip a beat.

The investor Olivia mentioned looked a lot like Michael.


Their seats were in the front. and once they sat down, nothing could be seen.


Isabella instinctively shook off the thought that had just popped into her head.thinking she was just too scared of Michael.

Everywhere she went,she felt like Michael was around.

Olivia noticed Isabella staring at the front row and remembered the "traces"she saw outside.


Taking advantage of Isabella's distraction, she asked, "Isabella, where did you go that night at the club? You left me there without a call. Did something happen to you?"


Just as she managed to suppress her guess about Michael, Olivia brought up the club incident.


Hearing that, Isabella almost choked.

If it weren't for that night, would she have ended up sleeping with
Michael? And now. they were entangled in a complicated relationship.

She swore she'd find Bianca, the culprit, and punish her severely.

"No, nothing happened," Isabella replied.

"Really?" Olivia pressed on. as if she wouldn't give up until she got an answer.


Isabella was extremely nervous, but the movie's opening saved her. "Aren't you here to watch the movie? Stop talking."

Olivia finally let her go and turned her attention to the screen.

But Isabella had lost interest in the movie.

She couldn't have been mistaken earlier, wondering it was so ridiculous to run into Michael at a movie.


After a while,feeling restless. Isabella got up to go to the restroom.

In the meantime, many couples had arrived. Isabella had to bend over to walk out.


When she reached the front row, she deliberately slowed down. In the light from the big screen, Michael's flawless features appeared before her.

Realizing it was really Michael, Isabella's heart skipped a beat.


Did Michael put a tracker on her, or was she just that unlucky, running into him everywhere?


She had only enjoyed a few days of peace since leaving the Brown Family.So she couldn't let him find her.
Thinking of Olivia waiting for her. Isabella swallowed hard, trying not to make herself too noticeable. and pulled her hat down as she went outside.

Just as she left. someone sat next to Olivia.

The man was dressed in trendy clothes, with light makeup,exuding sophistication from head to toe. But on his ruggedly handsome face, it looked out of place.


He curiously asked Olivia, "Who was that with you just now? I haven't seen her before."


It was a not-so-popular star. Tyrell Baldwin, a friend from her circle, who had some talent but lacked luck.


His face didn't fit the current mainstream aesthetic, and his style wasn't eye-catching enough to attract young girls. Over time, with no exposure,his agent gave up on him.


Recently, Tyrell had joined a few productions on his own, but none had made a significant impact.


Olivia raised her chin. "She's my personal designer, my best friend. Many of the outfits I wore in my debut photos were designed by her."

"Really?" Hearing she was Olivia's personal designer, Tyrell's eyes lit up.


Every artist knew how important a beloved look was. Once they had a signature style, they could ride that wave of popularity.


And Olivia had risen to fame on that wave. In just two short years,she had made significant strides in the entertainment industry.
###Chapter 91 The Power of Rumors

"Olivia, we're all friends here. Can you introduce her to me? I want to advance my career a bit," Tyrell spoke earnestly. In their circle, everyone wanted to be liked.


Anyone who could enter the entertainment industry had some talent; what they lacked was a bit of luck.

Olivia and Tyrell had known each other since their debut. One was a newly signed singer, the other a hardworking trainee.


Seeing him troubled daily without a breakthrough, Olivia also wanted to help him, but she couldn't make this decision for Isabella.


Olivia replied. "I can introduce you to her, but let me be clear, my friend is not an ordinary person. Whether she helps you or not depends on your own ability."


"I understand." Tyrell nodded and whispered, "As long as it can boost my popularity, the price is negotiable."


Tyrell had been in the industry for two or three years. For male artists,age was a hurdle. Without a breakthrough, he would be overshadowed by newcomers.


He wanted a return, and paying a price was worth it, especially when dealing with such a big.shot.


Olivia smirked. "My friend is the heiress of the Wilson Family. Do you think she needs your money?"


"She's the heiress of the Wilson Family?" Tyrell exclaimed, instantly drawing the attention of those nearby.
1
"They're talking about that person just now, right? I thought the figure looked familiar. Turns out it's the Wilson Family's heiress, Isabella,who's been all over the news recently." People in the back row joined in.


"Wow, are you serious? She's Isabella? I heard she's also the heiress to the P Wilson Group. That's so cool. Can I take a photo with her later? I really like her."


"Me too. I've watched all those videos of her arguing with people online. If I had half her strong mindset, that would be enough."


"So luckily. Just watching a movie and running into such a good thing. I must get a photo after the show."


Hearing people suddenly discussing Isabella's identity, Olivia quickly covered her face with her clothes.


'Oh my God. Do I unintentionally cause big trouble for Isabella?' She thought.

But she didn't expect something even more shocking was waiting for her.

"Not just Ms. Taylor, I heard someone saw Mr. Brown, Ms. Taylor's ex-husband. Someone saw him here too, with quite a few people."

Sensing the person didn't seem to be lying, Olivia suddenly felt a chill down her spine.

'Oh my God, why so unlucky today? How come even Michael is here? And I brought Isabella to watch a movie, just to run into Michael. Will Isabella think I do it on purpose?' Olivia thought desperately.

Sensing Olivía stunned, Tyrell thought of his earlier excamation and trembled, hiding himself as well.
But the crowd's curiosity was piqued, and the discussions continued.

"An ex-couple, both watching a movie in the same theater at the same time.How ridiculous."


"Exactly, what a coincidence. And Mr. Brown, coming to a regular cinema like ours. must be a planto win Ms.Taylor back. Looks like they might reconcile?"


"But they didn't sit together. Clearly, Mr. Brown followed Ms.Taylor here,regretting the divorce. He must have found out Ms. Taylor was here and planned a surprise to win her back."


When Isabella bent down to return to her seat, she was startled to hear people discussing her.


She had just stepped out for a bit. How did she become the center of attention upon returning?


The people were so focused on their discussion that they didn't notice Isabella with her head down, but their voices grew louder and more outrageous.


Some even spread rumors that Michael realized his feelings after the divorce and wanted to win Isabella back.


Just hearing it made Isabella feel the power of rumors was terrifying.

She shook her head, sat back in her seat, and noticed a man suddenly sitting next to Olivia.


Thinking he was just another curious person, she didn't pay much attention.
She tugged Olivia's arm and whispered, "Olivia, what's going on?Everything was fine earlier. Why is everyone talking about me now?"


Although her divorce with Michael had been a public affair, it had been days. The buzz should have died down by now.


Olivia forced a smile. "Isabella. how about I introduce you to someone first?11


She feared that if she told the truth. Isabella would kick Tyrell out immediately.


Moreover, she was doing this not just to help Tyrell but to keep Isabella calm.


As Isabella widened her eyes. Olivia shrank back and pulled Tyrell over.

"This is Tyrell, a friend I met when I debuted. He's good at singing and dancing, a very talented star, and also an actor." Olivia tried her best to highlight Tyrell's strengths.

"Nice to meet you, Ms. Taylor." Tyrell extended his hand, confident and natural.


Isabella finally saw the man clearly. He was good-looking, though his makeup was a bit odd. But since Tyrell was Olivia's friend, she didn't mind much.


"Hello, Mr. Baldwin." Isabella nodded politely, shook his hand briefly,and quickly withdrew.


More than Olivia's sudden friend, Isabella was curious about the surrounding discussions.
But not far in the front row, a pair of deep. sharp eyes took in the scene of their handshake.


In the flickering screen light. Isabella's makeup-free face was even more captivating.


Her casual outfit looked tailor-made for her, exuding a gentle and charming aura.


Noticing she smiled to Tyrell, Michael clenched his jaw, coldness spreading in his eyes.


In just three days. Isabella had forgotten his warning.

Tyrell was also stunned.

The entertainment industry was full of beautiful women, but to him,Isabella, in her white outfit, smiling at him, looked like a fairy descending from the heavens, natural, pure, with a unique charm.

It wasn't just her background; Tyrell was genuinely attracted to Isabella's unique allure.

Seeing no one beside Isabella, Tyrell moved past Oliva and sat directly next to Isabella. "Ms. Taylor, what do you usually like to do in your free time? Is it drawing designs, listening to music, or watching movies?"
###Chapter 92 Seducing a Man Right in Front o Him


Isabela was taken aback.


Only then did Tyrell realize that his sudden move might have made Isabella uncomfortable, and he quickly apologized. "Sorry. I just got too excited for a moment and couldn't help but come over. I didn't mean any harm."


Tyrell's attitude was very sincere, and Isabella, not being a petty person,didn't take it to heart.


However, his words did catch Isabella's attention. "What did you just ask me about? What design?"


Seeing that Isabella wasn't angry, Tyrell's fondness for her increased exponentially. "Actually, Olivia just told me that all her dresses were designed by you. Ms. Taylor, your talent and taste are truly impressive."


"That was many years ago. just something I did for fun." Isabella glanced at Olivia beside her.


She didn't understand why Olivia suddenly brought this up with Tyrell.Back then, Olivia had seen the sketches Isabella casually designed and insisted on wearing them to a party.


Unable to resist her pleading, Isabella made an exception and created the dress for her.


She hadn't expected it to have such an effect.

"To create something so stunning just for fun, Ms. Taylor, you are indeed
extraordinary." Tyrell was. thrilled and now fully believed Olivia's words.He looked at Isabella with eyes full of hope. "Ms. Taylor, I wonder if you are interested in private custom designs, or even just give some simple advice. To be honest. I've always wanted to change my style, but I could never get it right. No one watches me sing or dance, and I'm not good at acting. Now, I'm on the verge of being abandoned by my company."


Isabella could see that he was genuinely anxious. Since Tyrell was Olivia's friend, she decided to be straightforward. "Private custom designs might not be possible, but I can give you some advice."

"Really? I'm so lucky to get your personal feedback."

Isabella immediately identified the issues with his appearance and started from the key points.


With his serious looks, he should build a persona around strength rather than trying to cater to the public by making himself look cute.


As for clothing, Tyrell's larger frame was more suited to various black and white shirts.


Indeed, anyone could give advice, but it ultimately depended on him.

And he wasn't bad-looking; otherwise, he wouldn't have been chosen to be a star.


Tyrell listened intently. Over the past few years, he had lost his own judgment trying to cater to the public.


His makeup and clothing were aIl arranged by his agency.

This Ied to him always wanting to be like others but increasingly being ostracized.
He wanted to change his image but feared being ridiculed and accused of lacking talent but having ulterior motives. which would completely ruin his future.


Now. Isabella's few words had enlightened him, and he felt much more at ease.


The two continued to chat about how to match clothes, getting more and 名  more engrossed in the conversation.


However, they didn't notice a pair of eyes staring at them from the front row,growing increasingly sharp and deep.


'Who is that man? Is he the person she has come to see today?' Michael was burning with anger, feeling like he was about to explode, but since they were in a theater, he had to hold it in for now.


He had attended a party earlier and heard someone mention the film's premiere. As an investor in the film, he had to come and show his support.


Not wanting to waste time tomorrow, he had chosen a midnight screening.He hadn't expected to run into her here, and he had caught her red-handed not keeping her promise.

At this moment, Michael exuded a cold aura.


It wasn't until he saw her get up and walk outside that he restrained his dark gaze and followed her.


Outside, Isabella stood in the hallway, shaking her head as she headed to the restroom.


Tyrell had been too enthusiastic, first offering her a consultation fee, then inviting her to dinner, and finally even suggesting he become her assistant.
Tyrell was Olivia's friend. and she found it hard to handle.

Moreover, she had already hinted to Olivia, who understood her well and was probably explaining things to Tyrell by now.

It wouldn't hurt to stay outside for a while before going back.

Who knew that just as she entered the restroom and hadn't closed the door,a strong force pushed her inside and locked the door.


"Who?" Isabella quickly turned around. only to meet Michael's extremely angry eyes.

His whole demeanor seemed like he wanted to devour her alive.

"Michael, what are you doing here?" She knew he was in the theater,but this was the women's restroom. What was he doing following her here?Was he a pervert?


"What do you think I'm doing here?" Michael forcefully pinned her against the wall.

He didn't care where they were; he just wanted to demand what she had been talking about with Tyrell that made her so happy.


"Tell me, what were you talking about with that man? Why were you so happy with him?"

Isabella frowned,realizing he meant Tyrell.

"Michael, don't slander me. He's a celebrity... Wait, how do you know I was talking to Tyrell?" She suddenly realized and raised an eyebrow.


"Michael, were you spying on us in the theater? Or are you like those rumors online, regretting letting me go and trying to create various
encounters to win me back?" She said this, but Isabella knew better than anyone that Michael wouldIn't, and he never regretted divorcing her.


But his impulsiveness today made her think he cared about her, that he minded her talking to Tyrell.


After hearing her words. Michael sneered and grabbed her chin. "Isabella,should I say you're narcissistic or just naive? I'm here to warn you that we haven't officially divorced yet. I'm still your husband in name. Flirting with men in front of me. do you think I'm dead?"

His words were like a sharp knife, stabbing into Isabella's heart.

Just a moment ago. she had thought he was jealous of her talking to Tyrell.

It turned out he only cared about his own pride.

Anger filled her chest, and the light in Isabella's eyes dimmed.

She shook off his hand and provocatively said, "So what? Even if I slept with someone else, what does it have to do with you, Michael? Don't forget.we've signed the divorce papers. Soon, we won't have any relationship at all."


She wished she could sever all ties with him right now, then he would have no excuse to hurt her again.


Michael stared deeply at her. "Even so, for the remnaining time, you're still my wife. Stay away from those men and don't make me angry.understand?"


His large hand caressed her face, pinching her as a form of punishment.

Isabella frowned in disgust and avoided his touch. "Michael, don't touch
me. We're divorced. Who I'm with is none of your business!"

She reached for the door to leave. but the next second. she was grabbed from behind. and Michael's body pressed against hers.
###Chapter 93 The Intimacy in the Bathroom

Michael, who was already familiar with Isabella's body, slid his large hand from her waist to her most sensitive spot, gripping it with just the right amount of pressure.
A coquettish sound escaped her lips, and Isabella quickly covered her mouth in shock.


But Michael, beside her, was more than satisfied, a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. "That's better. If you had been this obedient earlier.how could I bear to make things difficult for you?"


Michael's voice was gentle, but there was no trace of affection in his eyes.He treated her like a stray cat on the street.

Isabella felt a pang of bitterness in her heart. She propped herself up to avoid sliding down, her voice numb. "Michael, we've been married for three years. Haven't I been obedient enough?"


After marrying him, she had put him first in everything, even abandoning her own identity, doing things she didn't like, and pleasing people she didn't care for.


However, it still ended in divorce.


Her eyes stung with unshed tears, and Isabella bit her lip to hold them back.


She was no longer his wife and would not shed another tear in front of him.


Meanwhile, Olivia had finished her conversation with Tyrell but couldn't find Isabella anywhere.
She called Isabella's phone..but no one answered.

Then she remembered that Michael was also here. Olivia was suddenly alarmed. wondering if Isabella could have run into him.


The more Olivia thought about it. the more uneasy she felt. She left Tyrell to wait and quickly went to look for Isabella.

As she reached the restroom door. she saw several people standing guard.

One of them she recognized from the hotel entrance-it was Isabella's bodyguard. who usually stayed out of sight.

Olivia breathed a sigh of relief and asked. "Is Ms. Taylor inside?"


The bodyguard recognized Olivia and nodded. "Ms. Taylor went in but hasn't come out. We can't go in without causing a scene.Ms.Smith.could you please check on her?"

They were all men and couldn't just barge in. no matter how worried they were.


Olivia nodded. "Alright. I'll go look for her."

Once inside. Olivia called out for Isabella, "Isabella, where are you? Answer me."


"Isabella." After calling few timeswith no response, Olivia frowned,feeling that something was off. "Isabella, are you okay? Is it that time of your period, or is your stomach hurting?"

She checked each stall in the empty restroom of the late-night cinema.

She searched from one end to the other but found no one.
Only the last stall by the window was left, usually used for storage. Olivia decided not to check it and turned to leave.


But she didn't expect that Isabella was trapped there by Michael, his body pinning her against the wall.

When Olivia had called out, Isabella had wanted to respond.

But before she could make a sound. Michael had covered her mouth,and his large body blocked her completely, making it impossible for her to make any noise.


Hearing Olivia about to leave. Isabella struggled desperately in Michael's arms. but he was much stronger than her, holding her tightly so that only her eyes could move.


She was about to give up. but Olivia was just one stall away from finding her.


Isabella prayed silently. 'Olivia, don't go. Just one more step, and you'll see me. Just a little further.'


But Michael's devilish voice responded, "Don't even think about it. Olivia can't save you. Tonight, you're mine, and no one can take you away."

Michael didn't release her mouth, so Isabella couldn't make a sound.

But his other hand wasn't idle, lifting her shirt and starting to tease her.

"Michael, you... pervert." Isabella was on the verge of suffocation, her face flushed, but it didn't stop Michael from taking advantage of her.

No matter how she tried to escape, she couldn't. Michael's hand unhooked her bra and continued to explore downward, even trying to enter her.
Suddenly,a loud phone ringtone broke the silence, which made Michael's actions pause instantly.


Meanwhile, Olivia, who had searched everywhere and found no one.thought the bodyguard at the door might have mistaken someone else for Isabella. Maybe she had already returned to the theater.


Just as she was about to head back, she heard a phone ringing in the previously empty restroom.

In that moment. she realized something and ran back inside.

In the last stall. Isabella clearly heard Olivia running back, and at the same time. Michael's phone call.


"Hello. Mr. Brown. This is the private men's clinic. You had an appointment a few days ago but didn't show up. May I ask why? If it's inconvenient for you to come in. we can offer home visits, though the fee will be higher." The caller's voice was deliberately low, but calling at this hour clearly aimed to exploit Michael's late-night vulnerability.

Isabella instinctively lowered her head.

But the next second, Michael's face was close to hers, holding the phone in front of her. "No need. I don't think I'll ever need it!"


He hung up the phone with one hand, his eyes burning with anger."Isabella,you are really something, consulting a men's clinic for me?"

No one else would dare do such a thing.

Before she could respond, there was a loud knock on the door.

Olivia's angry voice nearly blew the roof off. "Michael, are you bullying
Isabella in there? Let her go!"

"Don't think you can hide Isabella just because you're Mr. Brown. Isabella is the heiress of the Wilson Family. If you dare treat her like this.the Wilson Family will kill you." Olivia's voice was so loud that even the bodyguards outside heard it.


The next moment. several tall men in black suits rushed in, standing in front of Olivia and issuing a warning to those inside. "Mr. Brown! Release Ms. Taylor now. and we can all walk away peacefully. If you harm Ms.Taylor. we won't be so polite."

Inside. Michael was still fuming from the phone call and wanted to teach Isabella a lesson.


Before the bodyguards could count to three. Michael pushed the door open.only to see Tyrell, dressed in trendy clothes, standing behind the bodyguards.


Tyrell's anxious face relaxed visibly when he saw Isabella.

Seeing that, Michael's expression darkened.

In front of everyone. Michael raised an eyebrow and motioned to Tyrell."You,come here."


Tyrell was taken aback, pointing to himself, and didn't know what Michael wanted to do with him.


But after hearing so much of the conversation, he knew Michael's identity.He had no choice but to comply.


"Were you the one sitting next to Isabella, deliberately getting so close to her? What are you trying to do, seduce her?" Michael asked coldly.
###Chapter 94 Michael's Examination Report

Looking at Tyrell in front of him, Michael was filled with rage.

'Is he more handsome than me? What does Isabella see in him? Is it his charm or his ability to make her laugh?' Just thinking about how happy she had just smiled at Tyrell made Michael curse under his breath.?


They had been married for three years, and she had never smiled at him like that.


Tyrell was taken aback by the question. but when he looked at Isabella, his eyes were full of admiration.

He replied firmly. "I do like Ms. Taylor. but I would never try to seduce her.What I admire about her is her unique charm,her talent,her innocence and liveliness. and her innate confidence. Of course,if I ever have the honor of winning Ms. Taylor's favor. I will work very hard to support her, become her most trusted partner, and give her the happiness she desires."


Just now, Tyrell had already lost his heart to Isabella.

It was the first time he had met someone who moved him so much.

Just hearing her voice made him feel enveloped in a romantic atmosphere,eager to win her affection and love.

He hadn't expected this confession to come so urgently and suddenly,and even expressed his admiration for her in front of Michael.

Olivia, standing outside.was wide-eyed.

Isabella was equally shocked. She had only given Tyrell some advice and
chatted with him a bit. Had she really won him over just like that?

Whether it was true or not, this confession had given her a sense of satisfaction in front of Michael.


The whole world didn't revolve around him; she was also liked and appreciated by others.

But this act was nothing short of a direct provocation to Michael.

Isabella was his, and Tyrell dared to confess to her in front of him? He should consider the consequence.


If he hadn't witnessed the whole process himself.seeing that they had only chatted and nothing more, he could have made Tyrell disappear from Evergreen City overnight.

But now, he suddenly wanted to change his idea.

"Hearing you say that. I suddenly realize Isabella had so many good qualities." Michael paused, a wicked smile curling at his lips. He grabbed Isabella by the waist and pulled her towards him, kissing her in front of everyone, making sure it was loud and intimate. "But you have no chance.She's already my wife."


Tyrell's face changed, but before he could speak. Michael's eyes turned sharp, declaring his dominance.


"Don't let me see you in front of her again, or I can destroy you with just one word." After saying that, Michael let go of Isabella and strode out of the room.


The bodyguards, worried he might do something else, followedhim outside to keep watch.
Tyrell looked at Isabella. blushing, and then went outside.

After the commotion in the restroom. Isabella leaned weakly against the wall.gasping for breath.

Michael had just forcefully kissed her in front of everyone. ignoring her resistance.


If he hadn't grabbed her chin. she would have bitten him extremely.

"Isabella. you and Michael..." Olivia was stunned by their actions, from seeing them embrace when she opened the door to Michael's domineering kiss just now.


She couldn't wrap her head around it.

Isabella really didn't want to hear Michael's name right now. She took a deep breath and waved at Olivia. "Olivia, can I explain it to you later? I just want to go home now."


"Alright. I'll take you." Olivia understood her. Michael was simply too erratic. How could he be so cold to Isabella before the divorce and then cling to her afterward?

"Isabella,should we tell Tyrell? He's still waiting for you to help design his image." Olivia added.

Tyrell suddenly liking Isabella had also left Olivia bewildered.

But putting that aside, they had promised to help him,so they should keep their words.

Isabella pursed her lips and thought for a moment.

Although the situation was chaotic. Tyrell's sincere confession had indeed
helped her regain her lost dignity in front of Michael.

But she knew Michael's temper better than anyone. He hadn't acted out because she and Tyrell had done nothing wrong, but if they got too close.there was no guarantee he wouldn't go after Tyrell.

She couldn't let her momentary softness harm Tyrell. "Olivia, let's forget about it. I've already given him the necessary advice. and if I really help him. it would be like harming him. But if he has any financial difficulties.he can come to me."


Debts of gratitude had to be repaid. but not now. In a month. she would truly be free.


The next day. a very distinguished patient appeared at a private men's clinic.


Michael, dressed in a luxurious black suit with a matching coat, looked even more imposing with his tall and strong build.

The assistant saw him and quickly led Michael to the specialist's office.

They had even worked overtime today just to wait for him.

Isabella thought he had any performance issues, so today he would prove to her whether his body was really as she said.

The hospital staff served only him, speeding up all the tests.

In less than twenty minutes, the test results were in Michael's hands.

Seeing that every indicator was above average, Michael left with the report in a great mood.

At the Wilson Group. Isabella was in her office, dealing with the backlog of
work from the past few days. When she was just about to take a sip of water to relax. Jesse walkedI in with a courier envelope.


Isabella was puzzled. "I didn't order anything. Whose package is it?"

Jesse pointed to the name on it. sure he hadn't made a mistake. "It has your name on it. The sender didn't fill in their information. but it looks like a document. Could it be a contract from a partner company?"

"Alright. give it to me." Thinking it was a business contract, Isabella didn't think much of it. She tore open the envelope and pulled out the contents.

"A male reproductive health report!" Looking closely. the name on it was Michael.


She almost spat out the tea she had just drunk.

She had used his number to make an appointment at the men's clinic just to vent her anger. and he actually went.

And he had a whole stack of reports done. Could Michael really have a problem?


Since the report was in her hands, she might as well look at it. If there was an issue, she could stop the plan to have children in time.

Just as she was about to flip through it, Jesse's gaze fell on the report.

Isabella covered it with her hand and cleared her throat. "Jesse,you can go back to work."
###Chapter 95 Reason for Divorce, Sexual Dysf unction

Jesse closed the door as he left, and only then did Isabella reopen the examination report in her hand.


She flipped through the pages one by one, and none of the issues she was worried about were present.

But her face turned blush from what she saw, and even her ears felt warm.

Isabella read through all the pages without missing a single one, and finally, she slammed her hand on the table.


She realized that Michael had done this on purpose to show off to her.

She just wanted to know if he had any health issues, who cared about his stamina, length, or hardness? He even did the sperm motility test.


He was really confident. Was he so sure he could get her pregnant in one go?


Isabella took a deep breath, picked up her phone, and dialed the number she had memorized long ago.


The call was answered almost instantly, as if he had been waiting for her call. Michael's deep, sexy voice came through the phone. "So, are you satisfied with the results?"


Hearing his extremely proud tone, Isabella's suppressed anger flared up."
Mr.Brown, you didn't think I would believe a fake report you sent me,did you?"

Michael chuckled mischieyously, not taking her bait at all. "Isabella, you
should be able to tell if it's real or not. After all. you've experienced it firsthand. haven't you?"

Michael's words were full of innuendo, and the temperature on Isabella's face never went down.


"Besides. you made the appointment for me. If I didn't go. who knows what you'd think behind my back. I had to ease your worries. didn't I?"Although Michael said it as a joke. Isabella couldn't help but feel a bit guilty.


She did think that if Michael didn't dare to go. it meant he was hiding something, and she could always used it over him.Unexpectedly. he not only actually went but also did a bunch of tests, every single one.


He hadn't sexual dysfunction, but that didn't mean he could act superior in front of her.


"Michael. you're really funny. I just casually asked, and you couldn't wait to go to the hospital and get such a thorough check-up. Were you scared and eager to prove yourself to me?" At this point, Isabella seemed to think of something and suddenly laughed. "Well, we both know how fast you were that night. How many minutes was it? Too quick, I can't even remember."


Isabella added. "If you have time to do these pointless things, why not add more hush money to the agreement? For the sake of money. I might keep your secret after the divorce and not let your next wife know about your private matters."


That incident of a few minutes was a lifelong stain on Michael's record.

Isabella just had to bring it up in front of him to piss him off.
But Michael wasn't angry at all. He lightly retorted, "So what? You seemed to enjoy it at the time."

Realizing Michael still wouldn't admit defeat. Isabella couldn't be bothered to argue with him anymore and hung up.

Only he could treat sex as an honor to brag about.

But since he didn't care about the incident. didn't that mean she could...

The next day, at the Brown Group. Aaron had just finished reporting to Michael and opened the door to see someone avoiding eye contact in a fluster.


They were afraid to even glance at him.

He was puzzled and looked down at himself, finding nothing wrong.

But as he approached his colleagues' desks. those glances reappeared.

Having been by Michael's side for many years, Aaron could tell something was off. He knocked on a desk and asked directly. "What's the big news?Let's me see."


He raised an eyebrow, genuinely curious but with ahint of pressure in his tone.


His colleague looked embarrassed, then scared, and shook his head.

Aaron frowned, "Not talking? Then everyone loses $200 today, and no more chatting in the office."

"Don't, Mr. Hill. I'll tell you. okay?" At the mention of deductions,his colleague forced a smile. glanced around the office, and signaled him to come closer. "Well. I won't say much. Just check the latest newspaper in
the break room."

Aaron was about to leave when his colleague reminded him. "Don't say I told you."


Aaron frowned. "Is it that serious?"

His colleague nodded seriously. "Yes!"


Not only his colleague but also those around him looked at him with sympathetic eyes. as if he would be the unlucky one if he went.

As Michael's trusted assistant. Aaron usually didn't bother with such trivial matters, but he couldn't resist their mysterious behavior. He decided to check it out.


Five minutes later, Aaron returned to the office. "Mr. Brown, there's big news!"


Michael was on a call with a foreign company, and Aaron's outburst interrupted him. He coldly raised an eyebrow, scaring Aaron.


Michael said something to the other party and hung up, then looked at the flustered Aaron. "This better be important, or you'll lose your bonus this month."


Aaron swallowed and quickly handed over the newspaper.′′Mr.Brown,you should see for yourself."

Michael frowned at him. Aaron was usually efficient; what was wrong with him today?


He picked up the леwspaper, about to read, when Aaron cautiously reminded him, "It's on the front page."
Michael's brow twitched, and he looked at the top, where a bold red headline stood out.


#Michael Brown's Divorce: The Real Reason is Sexual Dysfunction.#

Michael spread out the newspaper to read more closely, but he felt a gaze on him.


Seeing this. Aaron quickly looked away, his face serious and righteous. "Mr.
Brown. these media outlets will write anything to attract attention, even your private matters. They don't respect our company at all. We must give
them a warning. or your dignity will be gone!"

Michael's eyes were deep. "What do you suggest?"

"Of course. we should issue a public statement and send legal notices to those media outlets." Aaron thought they definitely couldn't admit it.

After all, this was about Michael's male pride. If Michael admitted it,how could he face anyone in the future?


But before Aaron could finish, Michael's icy gaze shut him up. "Are you out of your mind? Do you think not enough people know about this?"

People tended to believe what they saw; no one cared about the truth.

Once the legal notices were sent, it would "confirm" his dysfunction

"Aaron, I need to reconsider your competence."
###Chapter 96 Emilio

Aaron knew he had truly hit Michael's sore spot this time. Given the current situation. he didn't dare provoke Michael any further. "Mr. Brown,I think with your perfect public image, no one would believe such baseless accusations."


Michael remained silent. his gaze not only cold but also filled with anger.

Aaron really didn't dare stay any longer. "Mr. Brown. I haven't finished the work you assigned me. I'll go handle it right away."

With that. Aaron quickly ran out without a second's hesitation.

The office door closed tightly once again.

Michael stared at the headline on the newspaper with a murderous look in his eyes.


Not only was the headline attention-grabbing, but the content was so detailed that he suspected someone had followed him into the hospital.

It listed all the tests he had undergone and even mentioned that he waited for the results before leaving.

At the bottom, there was a sentence.

#If Mr. Brown Has No Issues with His Sexual Function, Why Hasn't He Had a Child in Three Years?#


Going to the hospital indicated that even he had started to doubt himself.

Michael was speechless at first, then he laughed in anger.

The first thing that came to his mind was the conversation he had with
Isabella on the phone yesterday afternoon. Only she could do something this outrageous.


To get a divorce, she even dared to spread rumors about his sexual function.


Michael clenched the newspaper. grabbed his coat, and stormed out.


At the Wilson Group. Michael stood directly at the front desk. "Where's Isabella? I need to see her!"


The receptionist gasped when she saw Michael's face and recognized him as Isabella's ex-husband.


Considering Michael's status. the receptionist didn't bother with an appointment and nervously pointed. "Take the elevator straight to the top floor.the conference room."


In the spacious conference room. Isabella was discussing the internal management positions of the company. She had just promoted a newcomer and was taking the opportunity to showcase their abilities in front of everyone.


Before she could speak, there was a loud sound, with the conference room door was kicked open.

Isabella sat steadily at the head of the table, squinting at the furious Michael who walked in.


"Mr. Brown, this is the Wilson Group, not your Brown Group. Isn't this a bit too arrogant?" A board member recognized Michael and stood up angrily to stop him.

Isabella raised her hand to calm everyone down, indicating there was no
need to be nervous.

After all, she knew better than anyone why Michael was here.

But Michael's gaze fell on the young man sitting to Isabella's left, a cold glint in his eyes.


The man was tall and handsome. wearing a well-fitted suit and white shirt that didn't look lifeless but exuded a rare aura for someone his age. He didn't look much older than Isabella.


The two of them sitting together looked very pleasing to the eye, a perfect match.


The fact that he was sitting next to her clearly showed he had her favor.


Michael felt a sudden sense of crisis. He strode over to Isabella.momentarily forgetting the most important matter.


Michael's eyes were cold as he stared at the man. "I haven't seen this person before. Isabella. Aren't you going to introduce him?"


Though he asked for an introduction, anyone could see the strong sense of oppression emanating from Michael.

He wanted to hear how Isabella would introduce him.

Hearing that, Isabella was taken aback.

She knew the real reason Michael was here. So she wasn't surprised when he kicked open the conference room door.


But now. why was he suddenly confronting the new employee she had just hired?
But since he asked for an introduction, she would introduce him.

After all, the Wilson Group was her territory. She couldn't let Michael steal the spotlight.


"Since Mr. Brown is here, let's take this opportunity to formally introduce him to everyone." She gestured to the man beside her. "My friend, and the person I trust the most, the future Vice President of the company, Emilio Blair."


"Emilio, this is..." Isabella was about to introduce Michael to Emilio when Emilio interrupted her in a gentle tone. "Ms. Taylor. there's no need to introduce Mr. Brown. There's probably no one in Evergreen City who doesn't know Mr. Brown."


With that, Emilio politelyextended his hand. "Mr. Brown, we'll inevitably cross paths in the business world. I hope we have the opportunity to collaborate."


"I′′'m not fond of dealing with strangers." Michael's attitude was very condescending.


Emilio was just a Vice President, yet he dared to interrupt Isabella in front of all the board members. What bothered Michael the most was the way Isabella called him.


How close were they for her to call him by his first name so casually?

Given their unusual relationship. Michael decided to teach him a lesson,but he didn't expect to slip up.


As he was about to tighten his grip on Emilio's hand, Emilio's weight shifted, and in just a moment, Michael's face darkened.
However. Emilio remained calm and even smiled.


Michael finally understood where the aura he sensed from Emilio came from.Emilio was not a simple person.


Suddenly. Emilio released his grip. Michael suppressed the tingling in his hand and turned his gaze to Isabella. speaking with jealousy. "Isabella, be honest. Is he the adulterer you found outside?"

"Michael, show some respect to Emilio!" Isabella's face turned blush with anger.


She had known Emilio since they were very young. practically growing up together. Later. Emilio went abroad. and they gradually lost touch.

But they still texted each other occasionally.


This time. Emilio heard about the Wilson Group's difficulties in Evergreen City and came back specifically to help her. She was overjoyed when she found out.


She wouldn't allow anyone to slander or defame her relationship with Emilio.including Michael.

"What did I say wrong?" Michael looked at Isabella protecting Emilio. his eyes burning with anger.


He looked Emilio up and down, drawing a conclusion. "Or do you want to change your taste? You didn't like the guy from a few days ago,so you switched to this type?"

For a first meeting. Michael's words were incredibly rude.

Isabella was about to retort when Emilio stopped her. He stepped forward
and shielded Isabella behind him.

Emilio looked at Michael calmly. "Even someone like me who just returned from abroad knows about your relationship. Mr. Brown, as a man.don't you feel embarrassed questioning Isabella's judgment and coming here to cause trouble?"
###Chapter 97 She Will Come

Michael's expression was dark and terrifying, thinking Emilio didn't deserve to humiliated him to his face.


"The relationship between us is none of your business to judge. Isabella is my wife. Why do you shout in front of me?"

An invisible anger was spreading between the two.

Seeing Emilio's clenched fists. Isabella quickly inervened. "Emilio, please step outside for a moment."


"Ms. Taylor..." Emilio was worried about leaving her alone with Michael,but after receiving a signal from Isabella, he held back his words and left.

The others in the conference room, seeing the situation, left voluntarily.

Isabella led Michael to her office.

She closed the door and sat back in her chair with a stern face, warning Michael. "Michael, get this straight. This is the Wilson Group, not the Brown Group. If you have any issues, take them up with me. But if you're here to cause trouble, I won't hesitate to call security to throw you out."

Only then did Michael shift his full attention to Isabella, realizing she was different at work than usual.


The custom-made white suit dress perfectly outlined her graceful figure,her long hair draped over her shoulders, her makeup was exquisite,and her slightly furrowed brows exuded an aura of sharpness he had never seen before.

Michael was a bit dazed. From the first time he met Isabella, she had
always given him the impression of being obedient and compliant.especially after marriage. where she centered her life around him.


She was willing to lower herself to please him. even going to great lengths to seduce him in order to have his child.


Now. transformed into the CEO of the Wilson Group. she was stunningly unrecognizable.


But he hadn't forgotten why he was here today.


A newspaper he had been clutching all the way was slammed heavily on the desk. Michael. suppressing his anger, questioned, "Isabella, why did you do that? Do you really want everyone to know I have a sexual dysfunction?"


Isabella kept a straight face. steadfastly refusing to admit it. "How can you be so sure it was me? Besides, you went to the hospital, so why are you afraid of people talking?"

Michael was furious. "I went to the hospital for you!"


"What does that have to do with me. Michael? Don't slander me. I didn't force you to go. If you have erectile dysfunction, just admit it What's there to deny?" Isabella muttered softly.

Michael's face darkened, infuriated by her.

But seeing her red lips moving,he suddenly changed his mind, took a big step towards her, and gave a wicked smile.

"No one knows better than you whether I have a sexual dysfunction. Since you doubt it, why not test it on the spot to prove my 'ability." Michael's eyes darkened, and he was about to make a move on her.
Isabella quickly got up from her chair and looked at him speechlessly. "Mr.
Brown. you may be interested, but I'm not. We are in the office; I don't want to be seen."


"Mr. Brown, if you have nothing else, please leave. I have work to do."Isabella directly asked Michael to leave.

"I haven't gotten my justice yet. and you want to kick me out? Isabella, do you think I'm one of those adulterers who come at your beck and call?"Michael raised an eyebrow. completely ignoring Isabella's words. He grabbed her at the edge of the desk and pressed her down, kissing her directly.


Just as he was about to tear off her clothes. there was a knock on the door.

Isabella. pinned under Michael, froze in fear and bit down on Michael's lip.

She didn't control her strength, and Michael let out a muffled groan, his lip bleeding.

At this moment. a voice came from outside. "Ms. Taylor, are you in the office? There's a document that urgently needs your signature."

It was a subordinate from the secretary's office.

But looking at their situation, she was fine, just a bit disheveled.

But Michael was different. Not only was his lip bitten, but his tie was also a mess, and there were nail marks on his neck.

If her subordinate saw this, they would definitely think something was going on.

There wasn't enough time for him to hide elsewhere. Isabella pulled out a
chair and pointed under the desk. "Don't just stand there, get in."

Michael was stunned. a complex look flashing in his eyes.


"Hurry up. If someone sees us like this, how can I command respect in the company?" Isabella urged in a low voice.


Before she finished speaking. Michael ducked under the desk, moving so quickly that she thought he had changed his ways.

"Come in."

However. as soon as she sat down. she realized his true "plot."


The subordinate placed the document on the desk, and Isabella's hand trembled as she took the pen, startling the secretary."Ms. Taylor. are you okay?"

"I'm... fine." Isabella's face was flushed.

She bit her lip and clamped Michael's wandering hand between her legs.but she underestimated Michael's deviousness.


Isabella's tender inner thighs clamped his hand, but met with the mnore stimulating warmth of his tongue.

Isabella shuddered. If she hadn't bitten her lip, her voice would be heard.

She covered her mouth with one hand and quickly signed the document with the other, handing it back to the secretary."Alright, go handle it."

Michael was actually licking her with his tongue.

"Yes. Ms. Taylor." The secretary took the document and turned to leave.
During this time. Isabella did her best to suppress her voice. never feeling that a few minutes could be so torturous.


The door closed again.


Her body and emotions experienced the most intense sensation,and Isabella's tense body instantly went limp, her lower body already wet.

Michael knew her body and sensitive spots too well.

The next second. Michael stood up and pressed her onto the desk, his hands on either side of her, his lower body tightly pressed between her legs. making her feel his sexual function.

His cock pressed against her, and Michael deliberately pushed against her through their clothes.


"You're satisfied. but what about me?" Hot breath sprayed in her ear,and Michael bit her lip seductively. coaxing her. "Come to my placetonight..."

Before he could finish, Isabella pushed him away. "Dream it. I will never set foot in the Brown Villa again."


Michael stared at her flushed face and thought of her reaction just now,smiling, "Tonight, I'll be waiting for you in my room."

After speaking, he stood up, casually straightened his tie, and left.

As soon as he stepped out, Michael was met with the gazes of the people outside. Not only did he not try to hide, but he also openly displayed the "marks" Isabella had left on him.
###Chapter 98 Sex Video

As soon as Michael left, the staffs outside the office started gossiping.

"I didn't see it wrong, did I? Are those scratch marks on Mr. Brown's neck? And his mouth, were they that intense?"

"Ms. Taylor sure doesn't hold back when she gets physical."

"Look at Mr. Brown's expression, he doesn't seem angry at all, he looks happy."


At this moment, inside the office, Isabella patted her flushed face and looked towards the door, making a silent resolution.

She would never let Michael's words easily affect her again.

Thinking of something, Isabella picked up her phone and dialed Emilio."Emilio, do you have time? Let's have dinner tonight to celebrate your first day at the company."


"Really? How could I miss that? Just send me the location." Emilio's voice was gente and polite, with a hint of indulgenc


But the two had been friends for many years, and Emilio was always gentle and mature with everyone,so Isabella was used to it.

After agreeing on the time and place, Isabella hung up and leaned back in her chair.


She let out a heavy sigh, thinking she was so useless just know. She was clearly about to divorce him, but she stilI had feelings for him.
At nine o'clock in the evening. Isabella left home with her makeup perfectly done. Before leaving, she thought of Michael's annoying comment that she would definitely look for him, and found it laughable.


Isabella deliberately took a photo in front of the mirror and posted it online.

Isabella: [Got plans tonight.]


Thinking that Michael might be waiting for her at home alone at this time while she was out having fun. Isabella felt a great sense of satisfaction.


Isabella guessed right, Michael had canceled his plans early today and returned to their marital home.


Seeing her post online, he was just about to step into the bathroom.

Michael's eyes darkened. 'Isabella has plans? She even put on makeup and a dress, who is she meeting?'


The next second, the man he saw during the day,Emilio,flashed in his mind.


Isabella took it so seriously, could they be spending a wonderful night together after dinner?

The more Michael thought about it, the angrier he got.


In a well-atmosphered themed restaurant, Isabella was resting her face on her hand, listening with great interest to Emilio recounting their past fun times,


Isabella's face was glowing with a bright smile, and under her coat was a red dress that perfectly accentuated her figure, making her especially
attractive under the lights.

Emilio was witty and humorous. and he knew Isabella well. No matter what she mentioned. he could always make her laugh.


Isabella also felt that she had become much more cheerful since she asked Michael for a divorce.


She was no longer the Isabella who was anxious when Michael didn't come home.


All the signs showed that leaving him was the right choice.

Their marriage was something she had forced,and now it was time to let go.

They chatted and ate. the atmosphere was very harmonious.

But Michael sent her a message at this moment.

Michael: [If I don't see you in half an hour, the video will automatically be posted online.]

A short video followed the text.

Just looking at the video thumbnail. Isabella was stunned.

It showed a face lost in desire, eyes blurred, lips tightly bitten-it was clearly her.


Looking at the setting inside, it was from that night at the Brown Villa.when Michael had forced her.


Jsabella's hand holding the phone trembled slightly, and she cursed in her head. 'Michael, that bastard, was he a pervert to record during sex?'
Isabella: |Michael. you dare to post it and see what happens!!

Isabella was not only furious but also filled with hatred for Michael.

With this in his hands, she wouldn't have a peaceful night's sleep.

Michael, relying on the "leverage" he had, behaved more and more arrogantly.


Michael:[Now you have twenty-eight minutes left. Don't test my patience.you know I can do it.]

Isabella: [Michael.you madman!]

Isabella knew his nature well. he would do what he said.


But she wasn't just herself now; she represented the entire Wilson Group's image. So this kind of video absolutely couldn't appear online.


Even more terrifying was if Daniel saw it, she wouldn't know how to explain it. Gritting her teeth, she could only take a step back.


Sensing her face change, Emilio poured her a glass of water,showing concern. "What's wrong?"

Isabella's face showed guilt. "Emilio, I can't have dinner with you tonight.
Can we reschedule?"

After all. she was the one who suggested dinner, and now she was the one leaving.


Isabella felt embarrassed to say it.

But if she didn't return to the Brown Villa now, she really couldn't hold out against Michael.
Emilio shook his head good-naturedly. "It's okay. If you have something to do, just go back. It's late. I'll take you."


He said as he was about to get up, but Isabella quickly stopped him. "No I can go back myself. It's already bad enough to leave you here alone. I can't trouble you to take me."

"You take your time eating. I'll leave first." Isabella didn't let him get up.she grabbed her coat and bag and quickly left the restaurant.

The car arrived at the Brown Villa at a very fast speed.


Looking at the lit room on the second floor, Isabella's teeth were almost grinding to pieces.

She wanted to see what Michael wanted to do.


Only a nightlight was on in the hall, and Isabella headed straight to the second-floor bedroom, pushing the door open.


Michael was standing by the window in a dark bathrobe. Hearing the noise,he turned around, his eyes lighting up when he saw her. "Not bad, you're quite punctual."


Isabella's anger shot straight to her head, she slammed the door shut and walked up to him, extending her hand. "Where is it? Delete it in front of me now! This is illegal, believe it or not, I'll sue you for invading my privacy!"


Michael sneered."I'm filming my own wife, how is that illegal? This is clearly a couple game, even if you call the cop, it won't help."

Smelling Emilio's cologne, Michael wrinkled his nose.-′′GO)wash up and come out,"
Tsabella then remembered his true intention.

'Is he addicted to sex? Does the afternoon's desire last until now?' She thought.

But she wouldn't let him have his way, she hoped he would suffer from holding it in.


"No way! I'm warning you. delete the video now. or I'll call Grandpa over and see if you still..."


Michael picked her up and strode into the bathroom."Call him now.if you like excitement. I can get more people to watch."

"Michael. you pervert.you bastard, let me go."

"Alright. I'll let you go." Michael suddenly let go, and Isabella, unprepared.fell into the filled bathtub.

She was still wearing her clothes, feeling extremely uncomfortable being soaked.


Just as her hand reached the edge of the tub, Michael's body, like a mountain, pressed down on her, firmly trapping her in his grasp.
###Chapter 99 She Was Reluctant, He Lost I nt er est

"Tell me.who did you dress up like this for? Did you have sex?" Michael's presence was intimidating, and his hands were not idle as he questioned her.


He stripped her completely in the bathtub, and threw all the clothes Isabella had specially dressed up in for Emilio into the trash.

Isabella was speechless to the extreme.

Before the divorce, he couldn't wait to get rid of her. After the divorce,he started caring about everything she did, even controlling who she met.

Sometimes she really doubted if he knew what he was doing.

"Michael, did you control Bianca like this when you were with her?"Isabella couldn't help but ask.


He would tear her clothes, bite her, and touch her at every opportunity. He seemed to want to torment her in bed every day.


But when Isabella turned her head, she felt something was off.

Although Michael never admitted it. she could sense that he didn't seem to have much experience in relationships. So what did he and Bianca do before? Could it be that they never have sex.


Michael frowned at her words."Why are you bringing her up now?"

He immediately dropped his towel and pounced on her in the bathtub.

He kissed her collarbone and breast like a hungry wolf.
He couldn't even bear to hear her name; he really was protective of Bianca.

The subtle feelings that had just risen in Isabella's heart disappeared completely in an instant.

She smiled sarcastically. "Of course, you still won't reveal her whereabouts.Bianca is the one you love,how could I ever compare?"


Isabella, the heiressof the Wilson Group,actually found herself envying Bianca one day.

Bianca was the daughter of Harper, whom she hated the most.

She could never understand why Bianca could receive Michael's unconditional love without doing anything, while she didn't even have the right to be compared to Bianca.

Michael's hot kisses trailed down, his body exuding male hormones.

But no matter how he teased her, Isabella's body no longer responded.

He looked up in confusion. Usually, her body would react faster than his at this point. Sensing the unwillingness in Isabella's eyes. his face darkened.and he stopped.


The desire within him was suppressed to the extreme, gathering more intensely in his lower body.

But since she was unwilling, he lost interest.

Withdrawing his hand, Michael resisted looking at her and stepped out of the bathtub.


Isabella wasn't feeling any better. They had just had sex a few days ago,and her body was still injured, He had just teased her with his hands
again.

Now she was in pain again.

But she didn't want to face Michael right now. She soaked in the bathroom for a while before coming out.


Her clothes were torn by him, so she wrapped herself in a towel and put on a coat, planning to leave.


As soon as she turned the doorknob, Michael's figure rushed over,blocking her way.


Isabella was caught off guard and looked up to see Michael's cold eyes staring at her. "Where are you going?"

"Back to my place, Michael. I know what you're trying to do, but I don't want to." Isabella tried to open the door past him.


She couldn't stay, afraid that he would force her again like last time in the middle of the night.

"Who said you could leave? You're sleeping here tonight, nowhere else."Michael didn't give her a chance to resist, picking her up and throwing her onto the bed, pulling her into his arms after removing her coat.

Isabella struggled desperately, "Michael, I said I don't want to."

"Who said anything about having sex? Sleep!" Michael pressed her down with his hands, frowning in warning.′′If you keep moving, I can't guarantee I won't do something."


Isabella immediately quieted down. Seeing that Michael really didn't continue, she breathed a sigh of relief,
But with Michael's hot chest against her back, Isabella's heart still raced.

Apart from the first two times. she had never slep so intimately with Michael.


He used to sleep in a separate bed from her. and even if they had to share a bed. he wouldn't touch her. keeping a distance between them.

Michael kept his word. just holding her without doing anything.


Isabella thought she wouldn't get used to being held while sleeping. but Michael's body was so warm that she fell asleep in a daze.

When she woke up. the sun was already up outside.


Isabella stared blankly at the familiar scene. then suddenly realized where she was and sat up in bed. How did she end up staying at the Brown Villa again?


Michael was no longer in the room. Isabella quickly grabbed her coat and went into the walk-in closet.


She thought Michael would have thrown away all her clothes, so she planned to wear one of his shirts.

To her surprise. half of the closet was filled with her clothes.


To be precise, many of them still had the tags on. Isabella, who loved design, recognized them as the latest fall collections from various luxury brands.


But she couldn't understand why Michael put them in the closet.

But she didn't have time to think about it now; her priority was to leave.
While washing up. Isabella was startled by the pain on her lips. Looking in the mirror, she saw her lips were red and swollen, with a particularly deep color.

She twitched her mouth, wondering if Michael have some perverted hobby.

Kissing her like this in the middle of the night. was he trying to get back at her for not cooperating last night?

She had to find him and question him properly.

After getting ready. Isabella put on her coat and went downstairs. She didn't see Michael but saw Aiden.


Aiden's face lit up with a loving smile when he saw Isabella.

Michael hadn't lied; he really brought Isabella back.

"Isabella,you're awake. Are you hungry?" Aiden greeted warmly.

Isabella was also surprisedto see Aiden, but then she remembered how she had left in a hurry last time. probably scaring Aiden.


She walked up to Aiden and said, "Grandpa. I'm not hungry. Why are you in the front hall? Are you feeling better?"


"Much better. I missed you a lot, but seeing you and Michael getting along well. I'm relieved."


"Grandpa, I..." Isabella was about to explain that Michael had threatened her.but Aiden took her hand. "I know, Michael hurt your deeply. From now on, you'll have a sy in the Brown Group, and with me at home, he won't dare bully you again. You're still young. Clear up any misunderstandings and don't mention divorce again. Live your lives well."
Listening to Aiden's heartfelt advice. Isabella felt like her words were stuck in her throat.


She wanted to tell Aiden that it wasn't a misunderstanding between her and Michael, just he didn't love her. So there was no need to keep a loveless marriage.


But facing Aiden. who loved and protected her so much. she couldni't say a word.


Her reaction seemed like an agreement to Aiden. who happily called Daniel.

His first words made Isabella's face turn blush.
###Chapter 100 Of Course, I Like You... In Bed

"Daniel, I have fantastic news for you. Michael went to the hospital for a check-up. and he's in great shape. He and Isabella have been sleeping together every day. so they'll definitely have a baby soon." Aiden said happily.

Isabella was thinking of explaining her current relationship with Michael.

BBut when she heard Daniel's voice from the other side, she immediately pressed her lips together.


Moreover. listening to them discuss her having a baby made Isabella feel both strange and awkward.


She wanted to get up and sit farther away, and out of the corner of her eye.she saw Michael busy in the kitchen.

Isabella squinted her eyes, thinking she was hallucinating.

Isabella was both shocked and incredulous. Seeing Aiden still talking to Daniel about having kids, she got up and went to the kitchen.

As soon as Isabella entered, she directly questioned Michael, "Michael,what's wrong with my lips?"


Michael turned to look at her lips for a moment, then looked away. "You wouldn't let me have sex with you, so I had to kiss you."

After saying that, he continued with what he was doing.


He didn't show any extra emotion the whole time, and instead, he seemed to be blaming her.
Tsabella was stunned for a moment. and never expected that to be his answer.


She was furious. "What do you mean? Look at my lips. they're so swollen.How am I supposed to go out like this?"


Seeing that he didn't react at all. Isabella frowned and blocked his way.lifting her chin to show him the damage he had done.


Unexpectedly.he directly wrapped his arm around her waist, took a step forward. and pinned her against the door.


There was no one else in the kitchen, only a pot of boiling water steaming away.


Isabella's eyes widened. She never expected Michael to suddenly get so close to her here.


Before she could speak, he said. "Last night, I don't know who it was.but someone hugged me naked, almost making me lose control. How can I not ask for some compensation?"


"Stop talking nonsense." Isabella instinctively retorted, and Michael suddenly covered her mouth with his hand. "Keep your voice down.Grandpa is outside. Play along with me, or we won't be able to wrap this up. From today, you're moving back in. I'll have someone pick you up and drop you off at work every day.Be good."


Isabella's brow twitched hard. She wasn't going to listen to him. "No way!Why should I listen to you?"

What daily pick-up and drop-off? He just wanted to keep an eye on her.

But there was one thing she found very strange. Today's Michael was very
different from usual. like a. completely different person. Before, he wouldn't even bother to look at her.


"Michael, what are you up to?" Isabella asked.

Michael stared at her without any pretense. "I wanta child."

A child that belonged to both of them. Only then would she not run away from him again.


Michael added. "Haven't you always wanted to have a child? Instead of looking for someone you don't know. I'm the best choice.You know my health condition."


"You want to have a child with me?" Isabella frowned, and couldn't believe him.


If he wanted to keep her because of a child, why did he reject her every time during their three years of marriage? Why bring up it after the divorce?


"Michael, what are you really thinking?" Three years ago, she couldn't even arouse his interest when she was naked. Now he was willing to be with her to have a child.


MichaeI's eyes were deep, and his rough thumb brushed over her lips as he gave a wicked smile. "Of course. I like your performance in sex. How can I let go when I haven't had enough of you?"

"Michael. you bastard!" Isabella's face turned blush for a moment.Her heart had been racing just a second ago, but it turned out he liked having sex with her.


Isabella angrily swung her fist at him, but he easily caught it and pulled
her into his arms. Michael teased her with a mischievous smile. "If you hurt me.who will give you pleasure?"

"Get lost. I don't need."


Suddenly. a figure appeared outside. Aiden saw the scene and angrily shouted. "Michael. what are you doing? Let go of Isabella. Do you want to get hit again?"


Isabella took the opportunity to try to run, but Michael grabbed her waist and helplessly looked at Aiden at the door.


"Grandpa. don't you want us to have a child? We're just trying to improve our relationship. and you have to interrupt?" Michael's words left Aiden speechless.


Before Isabella could explain. Aiden's stern face quickly changed, and he left with a smile. "Alright, I'm leaving."

Seeing Aiden just left like that. Isabella was silent.


At the dining table. looking at the delicious breakfast spread, which made by Michael. Isabella was shocked.

If she hadn't seen it with her own eyes, she wouldn't have believed that Michael could cook.


Seeing Isabella just staring, Michael handed her an egg. "Eat quickly.We need to go to the hospital for a check-up later."


Isabella looked at the peeled egg in front of her, her eyelid twitching again,thinking she must be seeing things.

Not only did she see Michael cooking, but he also peeled an egg for her.
It took her a while to process Michael's words. "Where? The hospital?Why do I need a check-up? I'm not sick."


Michael didn't want a child for three years, and now he was in a hurry to have one with her. This wasn't like grocery shopping; it wasn't that easy.


Michael gave her a deep look and said patiently. "How can we prepare for pregnancy without a check-up?"


"Who said I want to..." The ringing of her phone interrupted Isabella. She glared at Michael and looked down to see that it was Daniel calling.


Isabella was startled and quickly answered, "Grandpa?"

Daniel said, "Isabella. I just talked to Aiden. You need to go for the check-up later. I've already sent Chris to pick you up from the Brown Villa. Be good and don't throw a tantrum."


"Grandpa. I'm not throwing a tantrum. Besides, I'm in great health. There's nothing wrong with me," As she spoke, she glanced at Michael, knowing it must have been him who secretly told Daniel.

Otherwise,how could Daniel call right after Michael mentioned the check-up?


Daniel added, "You haven't gotten pregnant in three years. Aiden just sent me Michael's check-up report. He's in great shape. If you haven't had a child in three years, you must have done something behind our backs! Are you avoiding having a child so you can sneak out and have fun?"


Isabella was known for her love of fun when she was with the Wilson Family, and Daniel knew this well.

"Grandpa, I'm your biological granddaughter. Why are you siding with
Michael instead of me?" Isabella was furious. What had Michael said to Daniel to make him believe everything he said?


It was clearly Michael who wouldn't cooperate with her, not even letting her into his bed. Otherwise, she wouldn't have been childless for three years. Now she had to take the blame for everything.




(I highly recommend a captivating book that I couldn't put down for three days and nights. It's incredibly engaging and a must-read. The title of the book is "Dad. Stay Away from My Mom" You can find it by searching for it in the search bar.)
