###Chapter 1

"Congratulations, Mrs. Martin! You're expecting, and your baby is perfectly healthy."

The doctor's words echoed in Evelyn's ears as she clutched the ultrasound report, her fingers trembling slightly. Shock and exhilaration warred within her—she could hardly believe it.

"You'll need to schedule regular check-ups. Where's your husband? I should brief him on prenatal care."

Evelyn blinked, snapping back to reality. "He couldn't make it today," she replied with a tight smile.

The doctor frowned. "No matter how busy he is, he should be here for you and your child."

By the time Evelyn stepped outside, a light drizzle had begun. She placed a hand over her still-flat stomach, marveling at the tiny life growing inside her.

Nathaniel's baby...

Her phone buzzed. A message from her husband.

"It's raining. Bring me an umbrella."

An address to an upscale billiards club followed.

Evelyn frowned. Nathaniel had claimed he was in meetings all day. Still, she didn’t hesitate. She instructed the driver to take her there.

At the club entrance, she dismissed the car. "You can go. I’ll leave with my husband."

The rain had intensified by then, drumming against the pavement. Holding the umbrella tightly, Evelyn entered the lavish club, her mind still spinning with the news of her pregnancy.

Should I tell him now? Or wait for his birthday?

She reached Room 203 and raised her hand to knock—then froze.

The voices inside turned her blood to ice.

"Seriously, Nathaniel? You actually think your wife will show up with an umbrella? Does she really believe you’d ever get wet?"

"She’s so obsessed with you, it’s pathetic."

A low, mocking chuckle. "Ridiculous."

Evelyn recognized that voice instantly.

Through the half-open door, she saw Nathaniel lounging in a leather chair, his sculpted features sharp under the dim lighting. Dressed in a tailored charcoal suit, he exuded effortless dominance.

His friend tossed his phone back with a smirk. "Relax, man. Why so possessive over your phone?"

"Because unlike you, I don’t enjoy wasting time."

"Please. If Isabella weren’t here, you wouldn’t even let us touch it."

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Isabella.

A name she hadn’t heard in years. A ghost from Nathaniel’s past.

Inside, the group’s attention shifted to the elegant woman in white seated beside Nathaniel. She smiled demurely. "Stop teasing him. It’s not funny."

Her friend snorted. "Oh, come on. Everyone knows you’re the only woman who ever mattered to Nathaniel."

"Right? Ask him yourself—he’d say the same."

Isabella glanced at Nathaniel, who merely smirked and stayed silent.

The room erupted in laughter.

"See? No one compares to Isabella!"

Evelyn’s grip on the umbrella tightened until her knuckles turned white.

Nathaniel’s phone buzzed. He typed quickly, then tossed it aside.

A second later, Evelyn’s phone vibrated.

"Don’t bother. Go home."

She stepped back, her heart pounding.

Outside, the rain poured harder. She pulled the ultrasound from her pocket—the ink had smudged beyond recognition.

She had wanted to surprise him.

Instead, she had been the joke.

With a bitter laugh, she tore the paper to shreds and let the wind carry them away.

Back at the Martin estate, the butler gasped when he saw her drenched state.

"Mrs. Martin! Good heavens—come inside!"

Servants swarmed around her, wrapping her in towels, fussing over hot baths and ginger tea.

No one noticed the sleek black car pulling up outside.

Nathaniel strode in moments later, his expression unreadable.

"What happened?"

Evelyn, curled on the sofa, didn’t look up.

"Sir, Mrs. Martin was caught in the storm," a maid explained.

His gaze darkened as he took in Evelyn’s shivering form—her damp hair clinging to her pale skin, her lips colorless.

"What the hell were you thinking?" His voice was sharp.

Evelyn forced a smile. "My phone died. I saw a child without an umbrella, so I gave him mine."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "You’re pregnant, and you risk getting sick for a stranger?"

The maids exchanged nervous glances.

Evelyn kept her eyes down, fighting back tears.

Without another word, Nathaniel scooped her up and carried her to the bathroom.

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn emerged, composed.

Nathaniel was on the sofa, typing on his laptop. He gestured to the steaming cup beside him. "Drink it."

She picked it up but didn’t sip.

"Nathaniel."

He didn’t look up. "Hmm?"

She studied his sharp profile, her throat tight.

Finally, he met her gaze.

Fresh from the shower, her cheeks were flushed, her lips no longer pale. But exhaustion lingered in her eyes.

Something flickered in Nathaniel’s expression—something hot and possessive.

Before she could speak, he pulled her into a searing kiss, his hands rough against her skin.

She barely had time to react before his phone rang.

He pulled back, his voice rough. "Drink the tea. Rest."

Then he was gone, answering the call on the balcony.

Evelyn stood frozen.

The night breeze carried his words inside.

"I won’t leave you. Sleep well."

His tone was tender—a side of him she had never known.

She laughed softly, bitterly.

Of course. That gentleness wasn’t for her.

She turned away.

When Nathaniel returned, she was sitting on the bed, staring blankly at the wall.

"Still awake?"

The mattress dipped as he sat beside her.

She didn’t look at him.

"I need to talk to you."

She already knew what was coming.

"Let’s get a divorce."

Her breath caught.

"Isabella’s back. I made her a promise." His voice was cold.

Evelyn closed her eyes.

"Is there no other way?"

###Chapter 2

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's penthouse, casting golden streaks across the sleek marble countertops. She sipped her coffee, the rich aroma mingling with the crisp morning air. Today was the day—the final presentation for the Martin Group’s luxury resort project.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel.

"Running late. Meet you at the office."

Evelyn sighed. Lately, Nathaniel had been distant, buried under the weight of his family’s expectations. She knew the pressure of inheriting the Martin empire was suffocating him, but she wished he would let her in.

Her assistant, Gabrielle, burst into the kitchen, her tablet in hand. "The car’s ready. And Gregory just texted—he’s already at the venue, double-checking the models."

Evelyn nodded, smoothing the fabric of her tailored blazer. "Let’s go."

The drive to Martin Group’s headquarters was tense. The city blurred past, but Evelyn’s mind was elsewhere—on Nathaniel’s evasiveness, on the whispers about Isabella Davis’s sudden return to town.

The conference room was packed when she arrived. Executives murmured among themselves, their eyes flickering toward her as she took her seat beside Gregory. Nathaniel wasn’t there yet.

Then the doors swung open.

Nathaniel strode in, his presence commanding the room. His sharp navy suit accentuated his broad shoulders, but his expression was unreadable. Behind him, in a fitted crimson dress, stood Isabella.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Isabella smiled, her gaze lingering on Nathaniel before sliding to Evelyn. "Long time no see," she purred.

Gregory leaned in, his voice low. "You okay?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Perfect."

Nathaniel cleared his throat. "Let’s begin."

As Evelyn launched into her presentation, she could feel Isabella’s eyes on her, assessing, calculating. The slides flickered—blueprints, renderings, timelines—but her focus wavered when Nathaniel’s phone buzzed. He glanced at it, his jaw tightening.

She recognized the name on the screen. Vanessa. Isabella’s agent.

The meeting ended with polite applause, but Evelyn barely registered it. Nathaniel pulled her aside as the room emptied.

"I need to explain," he started.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Isabella’s working with us now?"

"It’s complicated."

"Uncomplicate it."

Before he could answer, his phone rang again. He hesitated, then stepped away to take the call.

Gregory appeared at her side. "You handled that like a pro."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "I need air."

Outside, the city hummed with life, but Evelyn felt untethered. She pulled out her phone and dialed Charlotte, her best friend.

"Hey," Charlotte answered. "How’d it go?"

Evelyn stared at the Martin Group’s towering logo. "Isabella’s back."

A pause. "Oh."

"Yeah."

Charlotte sighed. "You need drinks. Tonight. No excuses."

Evelyn managed a weak laugh. "Deal."

As she hung up, a sleek black car pulled up to the curb. The window rolled down, revealing Isabella’s smirk.

"Need a ride?"

Evelyn’s grip tightened on her phone. "I’m good."

Isabella’s smile didn’t falter. "Suit yourself. But Nathaniel won’t always be there to save you."

The car sped off, leaving Evelyn standing there, the weight of those words settling over her like a storm.

"We married for a purpose, Evelyn. I've already failed Isabella once—I won't do it again," Nathaniel said firmly, shutting down any further argument.

Evelyn caught the tenderness in his voice when he mentioned Isabella, and a sharp pang of jealousy twisted inside her. It was painfully obvious his heart belonged only to Isabella, not her.

After a quiet moment, Evelyn exhaled softly. "Fine."

Her subdued tone made his brows knit briefly.

"I won't leave you empty-handed. This estate is yours. I'll transfer fifty million upfront, and—"

She cut him off before he could finish.

It was the first time she had ever interrupted him. Before, she wouldn’t have dared.

"I don’t want anything," Evelyn said, lifting her chin. Her expression was cool, but her eyes held something fragile. "Just one condition."

"What?"

"After the divorce, we never see each other again." Her voice was steady, resolute.

"Are you angry with me?" Nathaniel studied her intently, his voice dropping low.

"Of course not. Why would I be?" She gave him a faint, practiced smile.

She sounded sincere, calm—but Nathaniel wasn’t convinced.

His frown deepened. "I’m making a reasonable offer, not asking you to act out. Isn’t that request a little immature?"

"Immature?" Evelyn countered coolly. "It’s the only thing I’m asking for. Nothing else."

Afraid her composure might crack, she turned abruptly and snatched up the divorce papers. Without reading them, she grabbed a pen from the counter and signed her name in swift, decisive strokes.

Her heart ached. She had loved Nathaniel in secret for ten years, and he’d never known.

Swallowing back tears, she remembered the past year—how tender he’d been, how he’d made her foolishly believe he might love her too.

But she knew the truth. His heart had always belonged to Isabella.

Now, she had to let him go.

Steeling herself, Evelyn met his gaze. "When do we finalize the divorce?"

Nathaniel stiffened. He hadn’t expected Evelyn—always so gentle, so accommodating—to push for this so quickly.

"In such a hurry?" His voice was deceptively calm. "You know we can’t avoid each other forever. My family adores you. Are you cutting them off too?"

"You’re the one who wanted this," Evelyn said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Now that it’s happening, are you going to dictate my life after too?"

She forced another smile, her chest tight. Does this mean you can’t bear to let me go?

Unable to hold his gaze, she murmured, "Or does it mean you don’t love Isabella after all? That you’ve fallen for me instead?"

Nathaniel’s expression darkened, the air between them thickening with unspoken tension.

Finally, he spoke, his voice icy. "Evelyn, I don’t find that kind of joke amusing."

As if loving her was nothing but a punchline. Her smile faltered. "My apologies."

He watched her—always so composed, so careful—and something unfamiliar twisted inside him.

Evelyn drove straight to the architecture firm she co-owned with Gregory Wilson.

Lately, she’d been accused of plagiarizing a design draft, and if she didn’t resolve it fast, the fallout could ruin her reputation.

The moment she stepped into the office, Gregory took one look at her and frowned. "Evelyn, are you okay?"

She shook her head. "It’s nothing."

Glancing at her watch, she asked, "What did Summit Realty say?"

Summit was the client behind the disputed design.

"They want an explanation by tomorrow, or they’ll sue."

"What time’s the meeting? Should we head over now?"

Gregory nodded, falling into step beside her. As they walked, he handed her a folded note. "Someone’s offering a fortune for you to design a diamond necklace."

Evelyn skimmed the details and immediately shook her head. "Not now. Maybe after the divorce."

"You’re divorcing Nathaniel?"

"Yeah."

"His idea?"

Evelyn’s voice was barely audible. "Yeah. Isabella’s awake. He wants to marry her."

Gregory’s jaw tightened, his expression darkening with anger—and pain, for her.

He sighed. "Evelyn, why do you keep hurting yourself like this? A year ago, you never should’ve—"

###Chapter 3

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the bedroom. Evelyn stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

She sighed, rolling onto her back. The silk sheets felt cool against her skin, a stark contrast to the warmth she craved. Their marriage was supposed to be a fresh start, a union of love and ambition. Instead, it felt like she was living with a ghost—one who left before dawn and returned long after midnight.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory.

"Meeting at 10. Client wants revisions on the waterfront project. Bring your A-game."

Evelyn groaned. The waterfront project was supposed to be her breakthrough, but the client—Summit Realty—was proving impossible to please. She typed a quick reply and dragged herself out of bed.

Downstairs, Alfred, their butler, had already prepared breakfast. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted, setting down a cup of steaming coffee.

"Morning, Alfred," she murmured, taking a sip. The rich aroma did little to lift her mood.

"You seem troubled," he observed.

Evelyn forced a smile. "Just work stress."

Alfred nodded knowingly. "Mr. Martin mentioned he’d be late again tonight. Another board meeting."

Of course. She bit back a sarcastic remark. Nathaniel’s meetings were becoming as frequent as the stars in the sky.

Her phone buzzed again—this time, a notification from a gossip column.

"Isabella Davis Spotted at Elite Gala—Rumor Has It She’s Back for Good."

Evelyn’s grip tightened around her phone. Isabella. Nathaniel’s first love. The woman who had left him years ago, only to resurface now, like a storm on the horizon.

She exhaled sharply, tossing her phone onto the table.

"Everything alright, ma'am?" Alfred asked.

"Perfect," she lied.

But as she headed out the door, the weight of unspoken doubts pressed against her chest.

Was history about to repeat itself?

"If you truly knew me, you wouldn't keep dredging up the past," Evelyn said sharply.

She had given up her thriving career and public recognition to return to Mayby and marry Nathaniel, only to be handed divorce papers a year later.

Gregory felt the weight of her pain. His expression darkened, irritation flickering across his features.

Noticing his shift, Evelyn softened her tone. "Gregory, no marriage is flawless. I don’t regret being Nathaniel’s wife, even if only for a year. So don’t pity me. Love can’t be manufactured."

"You’re right. It’s better this way. At least now I don’t have to pretend," Gregory muttered, his voice trailing off.

Evelyn frowned. "Pretend what?"

"Nothing. I just never liked Nathaniel. Now I don’t have to fake it for your sake," he admitted.

She laughed lightly, though she’d never understood Gregory’s instant aversion to Nathaniel. The feeling had been mutual—like two alpha wolves refusing to share territory.

At Summit Realty, they were met with rejection. The project manager refused to intervene in the plagiarism accusation and even threatened legal action.

Despite their earnest pleas, it was futile.

Finally, the manager relented slightly. "We’ve just secured a deal with the Martin Group. They’re furious about this. Unless you can sway them, there’s nothing I can do."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. The Martin Group? Nathaniel’s family empire. Of course. He’d never help me now.

As they left the office, Gregory squeezed her shoulder. "Don’t worry. I’ll handle this. It’ll work out."

She forced a smile, though her mind raced. What options do I have? Going to Nathaniel is the only solution—but we’re divorcing. Would he even care?

Too drained to return to work, she asked Gregory to drive her to Pineview Villa.

The entire ride, Evelyn’s thoughts spiraled—her children, her career, the uncertain future looming ahead.

When they arrived, the evening sun cast a golden glow over the villa. Evelyn stepped out and turned to Gregory. "Let me think things through before we decide our next move. Drive safely."

Just as he opened his mouth to respond, his gaze flickered upward. Someone stood on the second-floor balcony, watching.

Gregory’s jaw tightened. He motioned Evelyn closer. "One more thing."

As she leaned toward the car window, he brushed a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "Take care of yourself."

Evelyn blinked, puzzled by the sudden tenderness.

From the balcony, the gesture looked intimate—almost like a kiss.

Inside, the moment she crossed the threshold, Nathaniel’s icy voice sliced through the air. "Couldn’t wait to see him, could you?"

She met his glare evenly. "I was at the office."

He scoffed. "We’re still married, Evelyn. Keep your distance from other men."

Her temper flared. "Gregory is a friend. And what about you and Isabella at the hospital? Just because I don’t mention it doesn’t mean I’m blind."

She squared her shoulders, voice dripping with sarcasm. "Sure. But remember—you’re still my husband. At least for now."
###Chapter 4

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. She stretched languidly, her fingers brushing against the cold sheets where Nathaniel should have been. Again.

Her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. Three missed calls from Gregory.

"Damn it," she muttered, scrambling to grab it just as the fourth call came through.

"Evelyn! Where the hell are you?" Gregory's voice crackled with barely contained frustration. "The Summit Realty presentation starts in forty-five minutes. Sebastian Wilson is already here, pacing like a caged tiger."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. She'd stayed up until 3 AM perfecting the blueprints, only to oversleep on the most important day of her career. "I'm on my way. Stall him with the preliminary models."

She threw on the first professional outfit she could find—a navy-blue pantsuit that Nathaniel once said made her look "unapproachably elegant"—and dashed out the door without breakfast.

The taxi ride was a blur of honking horns and her own racing thoughts. When she finally burst into the conference room, out of breath, all eyes turned to her.

Sebastian Wilson, CEO of Summit Realty, stood at the head of the table, his silver hair impeccably groomed, his sharp gaze assessing her like a specimen under glass. "Ah, Ms. Mitchell. How... punctual."

Evelyn forced a smile, ignoring the heat creeping up her neck. "My apologies, Mr. Wilson. Traffic was—"

"—irrelevant," he interrupted, tapping his platinum watch. "What matters is whether your designs can speak for themselves." He gestured to the empty projector screen. "Shall we?"

As Evelyn set up her presentation, she caught Nathaniel's secretary, Samuel Yates, slipping into the back of the room. Her pulse spiked. Was Nathaniel having her watched now?

But there was no time to dwell. She launched into her pitch, her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands. The 3D renderings of the luxury waterfront development shimmered to life—sleek glass towers cascading toward the bay, interconnected by sky bridges lined with verdant gardens.

Sebastian's expression remained unreadable until the final slide. Then, slowly, he began to clap. "Impressive. Though I'd expect nothing less from Edward Martin's granddaughter-in-law."

The room erupted in murmurs. Evelyn's grip tightened around her laser pointer. So that's why she'd gotten this meeting. Not her portfolio. Not her firm's reputation. Her marriage.

Before she could respond, the door swung open. Nathaniel strode in, his charcoal suit molding to his broad shoulders, his presence sucking the oxygen from the room. "Apologies for interrupting," he said smoothly, though his stormy eyes locked onto Sebastian. "I believe my wife's designs speak for themselves—without needing my family name as a footnote."

The tension crackled like live wires. Evelyn's breath caught. Nathaniel had never publicly defended her before.

Sebastian chuckled, unfazed. "Of course. Though I wonder..." He slid a glossy brochure across the table. The cover showed Isabella Davis, radiant in a sequined gown, holding a microphone beside renderings of a concert hall. "If we're discussing nepotism, perhaps Ms. Davis' new performing arts center deserves equal consideration?"

Evelyn's blood ran cold. Isabella. Nathaniel's ex. The woman whose shadow she could never escape.

Nathaniel's jaw tensed. Before he could speak, Evelyn stepped forward, her voice icy calm. "Mr. Wilson, with all due respect, my buildings stand on their own merits. Shall we discuss the seismic retrofitting plans? Or would you prefer to keep playing petty games?"

A beat of stunned silence. Then Sebastian threw back his head and laughed. "Touché, Ms. Mitchell. Proceed."

As Evelyn resumed her presentation, she caught Nathaniel's gaze. The pride shining in his eyes made her heart stutter.

Maybe, just maybe, she didn't need his name to shine. But having him in her corner? That felt like sunlight breaking through the storm.

Evelyn's sharp reply left Nathaniel momentarily stunned, his dark eyes flashing with irritation.

Seeking an escape from the mounting tension, she turned toward the stairs, but Nathaniel’s hand shot out, gripping her wrist with surprising force. His voice was rough, barely above a whisper. "Evelyn, are you giving me orders now?"

"I'm only asking for what’s fair," she countered, her chin lifting in defiance.

"Is this for him? Was every kindness you showed me just a lie?" Nathaniel pressed, his grip tightening.

Evelyn tried to twist free, but his hold was unyielding. When she struggled, he pulled her abruptly against his chest, the familiar scent of his cologne enveloping her. She stiffened, trapped in his arms.

"Answer me, Evelyn. Is it because of Gregory?" he demanded, his breath warm against her skin.

She bit her lip, hesitating. The proximity made her pulse race, her thoughts scattering. Finally, she whispered, "No, you’re imagining things. He’s just a friend."

"Just a friend?" Nathaniel’s voice dripped with skepticism.

"If you don’t believe me, why bother asking?" she shot back.

"Evelyn, Gregory isn’t right for you. Stay away from him," he ordered.

Anger flared in her chest. "We’re getting divorced. You can dictate what I do now, but after that, it’s none of your business. Who I see, who I—"

Her words were abruptly cut off as Nathaniel’s lips crashed against hers.

Evelyn froze, shock paralyzing her. They had been intimate before, but never like this—never with such raw, unchecked intensity.

His kiss was relentless, leaving no room for protest. She instinctively pushed against his chest, but the movement only seemed to spur him on. His hands tangled in her hair, tilting her head back as he deepened the kiss, their breaths mingling in a heated exchange.

Overwhelmed, Evelyn felt tears prick her eyes. His passion was dizzying, forcing her to clutch his shoulders for balance.

Just as the moment threatened to consume them, Nathaniel’s phone rang sharply, slicing through the tension. He broke the kiss abruptly but didn’t pull away entirely, resting his forehead against hers, his gaze burning into her.

Ignoring the persistent ringing, he finally answered without looking away from her. "What is it?"

"Nathaniel, I—I’m scared..."

Evelyn heard the soft, trembling voice on the other end—Isabella. Reality crashed over her like ice water.

What am I doing? She had already signed the divorce papers. They were over. How had this happened?

Face pale, she shoved Nathaniel away as he spoke into the phone and bolted up the stairs.

Nathaniel watched her retreat, his expression darkening. "What’s wrong, Isabella? Isn’t the nurse there?" he asked, his voice tight.

"I keep hearing noises outside. What if—what if he’s come back? Please, Nathaniel, come over," Isabella pleaded, her voice breaking.

Nathaniel remained silent, his jaw clenched.

Desperation edged her tone. "I think I remember something from that night... I might know what he looks like now..."
###Chapter 5

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She tapped her pencil absently against the blueprint, her mind wandering far from the commercial complex she was supposed to be designing.

A sharp knock startled her. "Come in," she called, straightening in her chair.

Gabrielle, her assistant, entered with a tablet in hand. "Mr. Wilson wants to see you in Conference Room B. Something about the Martin Group project."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. Nathaniel. Just the mention of anything related to him sent her heart into overdrive. "Tell him I'll be right there."

She took a moment to compose herself, smoothing imaginary wrinkles from her blouse. The elevator ride down felt interminable, each floor passing with agonizing slowness.

Gregory was already waiting when she arrived, his expression unreadable. "They've moved up the deadline," he said without preamble. "Martin wants preliminary designs by Friday."

"That's impossible!" The words burst out before she could stop them. "We need at least two more weeks for proper structural analysis."

Gregory shrugged. "Take it up with Nathaniel. He's waiting in his office." His lips quirked. "Though I suspect you won't mind the excuse to see him."

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks. "This is strictly professional."

"Of course it is." Gregory's knowing smile made her want to throw something at him.

The walk to Nathaniel's office felt like walking the plank. His secretary, Samuel, waved her through with a polite nod.

Nathaniel stood by the window, silhouetted against the Manhattan skyline. He turned as she entered, and even after all these months, the intensity of his gaze still stole her breath.

"Evelyn." Her name was a caress. "I was hoping you'd come yourself."

She forced her voice to remain steady. "Gregory mentioned the deadline change. We can't possibly—"

"I know." He closed the distance between them in three strides. "But my grandfather is insisting. I need your help."

The raw vulnerability in his tone undid her. Up close, she could see the shadows under his eyes, the tension in his jaw. Without thinking, she reached up to touch his face. "What's really going on?"

His hand covered hers, holding it against his cheek. "Edward's health is declining. He wants to see this project completed... in case..."

The unspoken words hung between them. Evelyn's throat tightened. "I'll make it work," she whispered.

Nathaniel's other hand came up to frame her face. His thumb brushed her lower lip, sending shivers down her spine. "Thank you," he murmured, just before his mouth claimed hers in a kiss that tasted of desperation and promise.

A discreet cough from the doorway had them springing apart. Samuel stood there, looking distinctly uncomfortable. "Mr. Martin, your eleven o'clock is here."

Nathaniel stepped back, but his eyes never left Evelyn's. "We'll continue this later."

As she walked back to her office, Evelyn touched her tingling lips. The project deadline was the least of her worries now. Because no matter how professional she tried to be, one thing was becoming painfully clear—she was falling hopelessly, irrevocably in love with Nathaniel Martin.

"I'll be there shortly. Make sure the nurse stays with you, alright?" Nathaniel's tone was soft, but his jaw clenched imperceptibly. His expression darkened into something unreadable after hearing Isabella's words.

Isabella practically glowed at his response. "Okay, I'll wait for you."

As soon as the call ended, Nathaniel's gaze flickered toward the staircase, his features hardening. He instructed the maid to remind Evelyn to eat before he strode out the door.

Moments later, the roar of an engine cut through the silence. From the bedroom window, Evelyn watched the sleek black car disappear down the driveway.

Her face was a mask of indifference, but the bitterness in her smile betrayed her. Visions of Nathaniel rushing to Isabella's side, consumed with worry, played relentlessly in her mind.

He truly loves her. So why am I still clinging to hope?

...

Nathaniel didn’t return to Pineview Villa that night. Evelyn knew he must have stayed at the hospital with Isabella.

It was the first time since their marriage that he had spent the night away—outside of business trips.

Evelyn didn’t text or call him. She had been trained to be the perfect wife—dignified, graceful, and above all, understanding.

Before marrying Nathaniel, her mother, Margaret Mitchell, and the other women in the family had drilled into her the art of being a wife who never inconvenienced her husband.

I’ve done everything right. So why does he still look at me with such indifference? The answer was painfully clear: He despises me too much to ever care.

She forced herself to face the truth. He doesn’t love me. He never will.

Sleep eluded her until dawn, but even then, it was fleeting. Her phone rang barely an hour later.

Nathaniel’s name flashed on the screen.

Evelyn answered, her voice rough with exhaustion. "Yes?"

"Are you awake?" he asked.

"Obviously," she replied flatly.

Nathaniel didn’t miss a beat. "Pack two outfits for Isabella and bring them to the hospital. She doesn’t want anyone else seeing her like this, so I need you to deliver them personally."

It wasn’t a request. It was a command.

Evelyn blinked, her face pale from lack of sleep. A beat of silence passed before she spoke. "You want me to bring them?"

"Yes. As soon as possible," he confirmed.

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the phone. "I barely know Ms. Davis. Won’t she be uncomfortable with me seeing her in this state?"

"She’ll manage. Just get here." His tone brooked no argument.

Evelyn bit her lip, the ache in her chest deepening. This is the last time, she told herself. The last time I bend to his will.

With forced calm, she replied, "I’ll be there in an hour."

She hung up before he could respond.

Trying to suppress the sting of his words was futile—each one carved deeper into her heart.

Is this his way of punishing me for riding home with Gregory last night?

Whether it was true or not, one thing was certain: she wanted out of this marriage more than ever.

With Isabella awake, this was only the beginning. Nathaniel would devote himself to her completely, and Evelyn would be left on the sidelines, forced to endure it.

She couldn’t live like that.

After pulling two unworn outfits from her wardrobe—clothes that were refreshed every season but never touched—Evelyn drove to the hospital.

Just as she raised her hand to knock on the ward door, a voice drifted through the gap.

"Nathaniel, I must look hideous right now. Will Evelyn laugh at me when she sees me?"

The question hung in the air, sharp as a blade.
###Chapter 6

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. She stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the cold sheets where Nathaniel should have been. Again.

Her phone buzzed violently on the nightstand. Three missed calls from Gregory.

"Damn it," she muttered, scrambling to answer the fourth ring.

"Evelyn! Where the hell are you?" Gregory's voice crackled through the speaker. "The Summit Realty presentation starts in forty minutes!"

Her stomach dropped. The Martin Group merger. The most important pitch of her career.

"I'm on my way," she lied, already sprinting to the walk-in closet.

Twenty-three minutes later, Evelyn burst through the glass doors of Mitchell & Wilson Architects, her heels clicking frantically against the polished concrete. Gabrielle materialized beside her, thrusting a tablet into her hands.

"Sebastian Wilson's already in the conference room. He looks pissed."

Evelyn smoothed her navy blazer, catching her reflection in the elevator doors. Dark circles. Frazzled hair. The ghost of last night's argument with Nathaniel still clinging to her like cheap perfume.

The elevator pinged.

Showtime.

Sebastian Wilson stood at the head of the conference table, his tailored suit costing more than Evelyn's monthly rent. His cold gaze tracked her entrance like a predator sizing up wounded prey.

"Ms. Mitchell. How... prompt of you."

Jonathan Blake smirked from Sebastian's right, twirling a gold pen between his fingers. The Summit Realty project manager had been gunning for her position since day one.

Evelyn activated the holographic display with trembling fingers. "Gentlemen, let me walk you through our vision for the Martin waterfront development."

The 3D rendering shimmered to life - a breathtaking fusion of glass and steel that would redefine the city's skyline. Sebastian's expression remained unreadable.

"Interesting concept," he finally said. "But can your firm handle this scale? Rumor has it your husband's family prefers... traditional architects."

The barb struck true. Nathaniel's grandfather Edward had publicly trashed modern architecture at last month's charity gala.

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. "My marriage has no bearing on my professional—"

Her phone vibrated. A news alert flashed across the screen:

Breaking: Isabella Davis Returns - Supermodel Spotted at Martin Private Airport

The blood drained from Evelyn's face. Isabella. Nathaniel's legendary first love. Back from Paris.

Sebastian's smile turned razor-sharp. "Problem, Ms. Mitchell?"

The conference room walls seemed to pulse around her. Every eye drilling into her crumbling composure.

Evelyn forced a smile. "Just a minor household issue. Now, about these sustainability features..."

But the damage was done.

As she mechanically presented the solar panel schematics, her mind raced to the text Nathaniel had sent at 3:17 AM:

Need to talk. It's about Isabella.

The grandfather clock in the corner ticked louder with each passing second, counting down to the moment her professional and personal worlds would collide.

My Fault?

"You could never be ugly. You're healing, that's all. Don't worry, alright?" Nathaniel reassured Isabella, his voice tender.

"Really? You won't change your mind about me?" Her eyes shimmered with fragile hope.

Without missing a beat, he replied, "Never. Once you're better, we'll get married."

"You promise? You're not just saying that?" Isabella pressed, her fingers tightening around the bedsheet.

"I mean every word. Now, eat," Nathaniel murmured, brushing a strand of hair from her face.

"Nathaniel, I love you," she whispered, her voice like a soft sigh.

Outside the door, Evelyn stood frozen, every word piercing through her like shards of glass. She bit her lip, forcing herself to stay quiet. This wasn’t her moment to interrupt.

When the conversation lulled, she finally knocked.

A cold, detached voice answered, "Come in."

Stepping inside, Evelyn immediately spotted Nathaniel by the bed, still in yesterday’s suit. He hadn’t left the hospital all night. His gaze flicked to her—icy, indifferent, as if she were nothing more than a stranger.

Evelyn clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

From the bed, Isabella brightened. "Evelyn! Thank you for bringing the clothes. Come, sit with us."

Pale and delicate, Isabella’s shoulder-length hair framed her face in a way that made her look heartbreakingly beautiful. The kind of beauty that demanded protection.

She was eating a bowl of cinnamon-laced oatmeal—soft food for her recovery. But the overpowering scent hit Evelyn like a wave.

Her stomach twisted violently. She gagged, slapping a hand over her mouth.

Silence.

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed. "What’s your problem?"

"Evelyn… do I disgust you?" Isabella asked, her voice trembling.

Evelyn swallowed hard, forcing her expression neutral. "It’s not you. The hospital smell just gets to me."

She thrust the bag of clothes forward, avoiding the cinnamon. "Here. Everything you asked for."

Isabella took it, beaming. "You remembered my style! You’re so thoughtful."

Evelyn’s mind reeled. Her style? So the endless wardrobe updates at Pineview Villa were for her?

She shot Nathaniel a mocking glance, lips curling into a bitter smirk.

"If we’re done here, can we talk?" Evelyn asked coolly.

Isabella flinched. "Evelyn, please don’t be upset. I know you’re still his wife. I shouldn’t have called him so late, but I—"

Tears welled in her eyes, her breath hitching.

"Isabella, stop," Nathaniel cut in, voice tight. "The doctor said no stress."

Once she calmed, he turned to Evelyn, jaw clenched. "Why are you making this harder?"

Evelyn nearly laughed. I haven’t even done anything, and it’s my fault?

She forced a tight smile. "Does it matter? If Ms. Davis cared, she wouldn’t have called at midnight. But it’s fine—we’re divorced now. No need for theatrics."

Nathaniel’s frown deepened, an odd pang in his chest despite getting what he wanted. "If you’re mad about the clothes, blame me. Isabella’s too fragile for this."

Evelyn’s nails bit deeper. So it’s fine if I’m hurt, but not her.

Isabella reached for Nathaniel’s hand. "Don’t be harsh. It’s my fault." She turned to Evelyn. "I’m sorry for the trouble."

Evelyn said nothing, face unreadable.

Isabella blinked, unnerved by her silence.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Let’s finalize the paperwork. When?"

"Monday morning," Nathaniel bit out.

Today was Saturday. Two days.

"Perfect," Evelyn said lightly. "I’ll leave you two alone."

Nathaniel didn’t respond, his expression stormy.

What did I do now? Evelyn mocked herself silently before turning on her heel and walking out.

Behind her, Isabella murmured, "Go after her. Talk it out."

"Nothing to say," Nathaniel muttered, though his grip on the chair tightened.

Since when did she become so stubborn? he wondered, irritation flaring.

###Chapter 7

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stretched beneath the silk sheets, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

She sighed, running a hand through her tousled auburn hair. Three weeks since their rushed wedding, and she still woke up expecting to find him beside her. But the CEO of Martin Group had responsibilities that didn't include lazy mornings with his new wife.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A text from Gabrielle: Meeting moved to 10 AM. Client wants revisions on the waterfront project.

Evelyn groaned. She'd spent all night perfecting those blueprints. Throwing off the covers, she padded to the walk-in closet. Her fingers trailed over Nathaniel's impeccably organized suits before selecting a navy pencil dress—professional yet subtly alluring.

Alfred was setting breakfast in the sunroom when she entered. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin. Mr. Martin asked me to inform you he'll be dining with Mr. Prescott tonight."

"Again?" The words slipped out before she could stop them.

The butler's expression remained neutral as he poured her coffee. "Shall I prepare your usual?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Yes, thank you." She picked at her avocado toast, scrolling through emails. One from Gregory caught her eye—Urgent: Summit Realty deal falling through.

Her stomach dropped. This project was their firm's lifeline. She dialed Gregory's number.

"Evelyn, thank God," he answered on the first ring. "Sebastian Wilson just pulled his funding. Says our designs don't match his 'vision.'"

She clenched her fist. "I'll handle it. Set up a meeting."

"Already did. Noon at their headquarters. Bring your A-game."

Evelyn ended the call and immediately dialed Nathaniel. Voicemail. Of course. She left a clipped message about rescheduling their dinner before rushing upstairs to gather her materials.

The Martin Tower lobby gleamed with cold marble as Evelyn strode in at 11:45 AM. The receptionist eyed her skeptically. "Do you have an appointment?"

"Evelyn Martin to see Sebastian Wilson." She emphasized the surname, watching the woman's eyes widen in recognition.

The elevator ride to the 42nd floor gave her just enough time to steady her breathing. The doors opened to reveal Jonathan Blake waiting with crossed arms.

"Mrs. Martin," he said without warmth. "Mr. Wilson's expecting you."

Sebastian's office was all glass and steel, the city sprawling beneath them. The silver-haired tycoon didn't rise from his chair. "I assumed Gregory would come begging, not Martin's new bride."

Evelyn set her portfolio on his desk with deliberate calm. "Let's discuss why you're abandoning a project that would increase Summit's property values by thirty percent."

Sebastian smirked. "Your husband's influence won't work here, sweetheart."

"Good." She flipped open her designs. "Because these numbers speak for themselves."

Two hours later, Evelyn emerged victorious, contract secured. Her phone buzzed—Nathaniel finally returning her call.

"Evelyn? What's wrong?"

She stepped into the elevator, suddenly exhausted. "Nothing. Just saved our firm. Where are you?"

A pause. "With Isabella. She's... having some difficulties."

The doors closed as ice flooded Evelyn's veins. Of course. His precious Isabella always came first.

"I see," she said quietly. "Well, don't worry about dinner. I have plans anyway."

She hung up before he could respond, pressing a trembling hand to her lips. The reflection in the elevator mirrors showed a woman perfectly composed—if one didn't notice the cracks forming beneath the surface.

Tears spilled down Evelyn's cheeks the moment she stepped out of the hospital ward.

She had thought she was prepared after Nathaniel dropped the word divorce the night before. But seeing him with Isabella still cut deep, like a knife twisting in her chest until the pain dulled into numbness.

She returned to Pineview Villa—the grand estate gifted to them by Nathaniel’s grandfather, Edward Martin, as a wedding present. A year’s worth of memories lingered in every corner, now destined to fade.

Once the paperwork is finalized, I’ll have to leave. The thought settled heavily in her mind. And I should start looking for a new place. The Mitchells won’t welcome me back.

With a deep breath, she decided to inform her family about the divorce before rumors reached them first.

After freshening up, she drove to Mitchell Manor.

She hadn’t visited often since her marriage—Margaret had never hidden her disapproval.

As Evelyn reached the entrance, hushed voices drifted from inside.

"Mom, I heard Isabella woke up from her coma. Nathaniel hasn’t left her side. What if she remembers…?" Sophia’s voice was laced with worry.

"Enough, Sophia," Margaret chided gently. "Focus on your work at Mitchell Group and the upcoming design competition. That’s what matters now."

Evelyn stiffened at the mention of Isabella’s name but didn’t linger. She stepped into the living room.

"Mom, I’m home," she said softly.

Margaret sat gracefully on the sofa, her elegance undeniable, her features bearing a faint resemblance to Evelyn’s. Both women looked up, startled by her sudden appearance.

Sophia’s lips curled into a smile that didn’t reach her eyes. "Evelyn, what a surprise. Did you just arrive? Or were you listening in on our conversation?"
###Chapter 8

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of our penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. I stretched beneath the silk sheets, my fingers brushing against the cold space where Nathaniel should have been. Again.

My phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. Gabrielle's name flashed across the screen with three missed calls and a string of urgent texts about the Montgomery project revisions. I groaned, rubbing sleep from my eyes. Another day playing catch-up while my husband disappeared into his corporate empire.

The scent of freshly brewed coffee led me to the kitchen where Alfred stood like a silent sentinel, polishing silverware that already gleamed. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin. Mr. Martin left early for the office again." His tone carried the slightest hint of disapproval. "He asked me to remind you about the charity gala tonight."

I nearly choked on my orange juice. "Tonight? He's known about this for weeks and tells me now?" The crystal glass trembled in my hand. Three months of marriage, and Nathaniel still treated me like an afterthought in his meticulously scheduled life.

My phone buzzed again - this time, Charlotte's name appeared. "You'll never guess who just waltzed into my boutique," her message read, followed by a grainy photo that made my blood run cold. Isabella Davis, radiant as ever in a cream Dior suit, examining handbags with that calculated grace I remembered all too well.

The coffee turned to acid in my stomach. Nathaniel's first love, the woman who'd shattered his heart before I'd put it back together, was back in town. And judging by the timestamp, she'd arrived exactly when my husband started working "late" every night.

I was halfway to the shower when the landline rang. Alfred answered with his usual decorum before his expression shifted. "Mrs. Martin? It's Mr. Martin's office. They're asking about the seating chart for tonight."

"Tell Samuel to check the file I emailed last week," I snapped, then immediately regretted my tone. None of this was the staff's fault. The steam from the shower couldn't wash away the tension coiling in my shoulders. As the hot water pounded my skin, I made a decision - if Nathaniel wanted to play games, I'd learn the rules.

By noon, I'd approved the Montgomery revisions, rescheduled two client meetings, and called in a favor with Seraphina for a last-minute gown fitting. The emerald green silk whispered against my skin as she pinned the hem, her critical eye missing nothing. "This color makes your eyes look like gemstones," she murmured. "Perfect for making an impression."

The unspoken "on your husband" hung between us. News traveled fast in our circles.

At 7:15 PM, the town car pulled up to the Metropolitan Museum's glittering entrance. I adjusted the diamond teardrop earrings Nathaniel had given me on our wedding day, watching the paparazzi's flashes illuminate the red carpet. No sign of my husband yet.

"Mrs. Martin!" A reporter called as I ascended the steps. "Is it true Isabella Davis is back in New York? Any comment on rumors she's working with Martin Group?"

I smiled my practiced society smile, the one that didn't reach my eyes. "New York always welcomes talented professionals." The lie tasted bitter, but I'd perfected the art of keeping our private life private.

Inside the gilded hall, champagne flutes clinked beneath the crystal chandeliers. I spotted Nathaniel near the auction podium, his broad shoulders straining against his tuxedo as he conferred with Samuel. His dark hair was slightly mussed, the way it got when he'd been running his hands through it in frustration. Some things never changed.

Then I saw her.

Isabella materialized at his side like a phantom, her scarlet nails brushing his forearm as she leaned in to whisper something that made him laugh - really laugh, the deep, unguarded sound I rarely heard anymore. The sight hit me like a physical blow.

My heels clicked against the parquet as I crossed the room. Nathaniel's head snapped up, his gray eyes widening when he saw me. "Evelyn. You're... stunning."

Isabella's smile didn't falter as she turned, her gaze sweeping over me with calculated appraisal. "Darling Evelyn. How lovely to see you again." Her French manicure gleamed as she extended a hand. "Nathaniel was just telling me about your work on the waterfront project. Quite impressive for someone so... new to the industry."

The veiled barb found its mark, but I merely clasped her hand. "Isabella. What a surprise. I didn't realize you were back in the States." My grip tightened just enough to see her blink. "Nathaniel didn't mention it."

His jaw tensed. "It came up rather suddenly. Isabella's consulting on the Singapore acquisition."

"Of course." I sipped my champagne, the bubbles sharp against my tongue. "How convenient."

The orchestra began a waltz, saving us from further conversation. Nathaniel's hand settled at the small of my back, warm through the thin silk. "Dance with me."

On the dance floor, his fingers interlaced with mine. "You're angry," he murmured against my temple.

"Observant as always." I forced my body to relax into the familiar rhythm of our movements. "When were you planning to tell me?"

His sigh ruffled my hair. "It's business, Evelyn. Nothing more."

The music swelled, and I caught Isabella watching us from the edge of the dance floor, her crimson lips curved in a smile that didn't reach her cold blue eyes. "Then why does it feel like a test?"

Nathaniel's arms tightened around me. "It's not."

But as the final notes faded and the applause erupted around us, I couldn't shake the feeling that the real performance was just beginning.

The moment Evelyn spoke those words, Margaret's face darkened instantly. "Sophia, how many times must I remind you? No more sneaking around. You're not some country bumpkin anymore. You're a socialite—a Mitchell, Nathaniel's wife."

Evelyn lowered her gaze, her expression unreadable. She nodded softly. "Understood, Mother."

Margaret's stern features softened slightly. "Then sit down."

Evelyn obeyed, settling gracefully onto the sofa, her posture impeccable. Her striking beauty was undeniable—no matter what she wore, she commanded attention. This, at least, was one thing Margaret could take pride in.

Her voice gentled as she asked, "What brings you home at this hour?"

Evelyn lifted her eyes, meeting Margaret's gaze with unwavering resolve. "I'm divorcing Nathaniel."

The words struck like lightning. Margaret froze. Even Sophia gasped.

Recovering swiftly, Margaret's brow furrowed. "Excuse me? You're divorcing Nathaniel?"

"Yes. The paperwork will be finalized Monday." Evelyn's tone was firm.

"Do you even comprehend what you're saying?" Margaret's voice sharpened. "Your grandfather sacrificed his leg—his life—to secure this marriage for you. And now you're throwing it away?"

This union was no ordinary arrangement. The Martins and Mitchells had been bound by blood and loyalty for generations. Years ago, Charles Mitchell had saved Edward Martin's life in a devastating accident, losing his leg in the process.

Edward, in gratitude, had proposed a marriage alliance. But it wasn't until Nathaniel's generation that both families had suitable heirs.

Originally, the bride was meant to be Sophia—the Mitchells' golden child.

But Charles, already on his deathbed, had insisted on bringing Evelyn back from the countryside to marry Nathaniel. He had even threatened his own son, William, with his dying breath to ensure it happened.

Though Evelyn was Margaret's flesh and blood, Margaret had always longed for a son. After Evelyn's birth, complications left her unable to conceive again. She never forgave Evelyn for that.

Evelyn had been sent away at ten, only returning a year ago for the wedding.

Margaret's fury erupted. She stood abruptly, storming toward Evelyn. "Tell me this is a joke. Say you didn't mean it!"

Evelyn met her gaze steadily. "Nathaniel wants Isabella. I've already signed the papers. This isn't—"

A sharp crack echoed through the room as Margaret's palm struck Evelyn's cheek.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered. Her ears rang. For a moment, the world went silent.

Margaret froze, shocked by her own actions—but she didn't regret it. Pointing to the door, she hissed, "Get out. I have no daughter like you."

Evelyn rose mechanically, walking out like a marionette with cut strings.

As soon as she left, Margaret called William. This divorce wasn't just about two people—it involved two families, their businesses, their legacies. It couldn't be this simple.

Outside Mitchell Manor, Evelyn leaned against her car, struggling to steady her breathing.

Her biggest concern was the child inside her. At least the slap had only grazed her cheek.

Did it hurt? Not really. She felt... nothing.

This wasn't the first time Margaret had been cruel, just the first time she'd struck her. Evelyn was numb to it.

If a slap was the price of freedom, she'd pay it gladly.

Just as she reached for the car door, Sophia's voice cut through the silence. "Evelyn, are you seriously divorcing Nathaniel?"

Evelyn didn't answer. She merely glanced at her sister, cold and detached.

Sophia scowled. "If you didn't want him, why marry him? The Mitchells have been struggling for years. Father relies on the Martins to keep the company afloat. You're being selfish."

"So?" Evelyn's voice was ice.

Internally, she thought, I endured Nathaniel because I loved him. I tolerated Margaret because she birthed me. But no one else gets to judge me.

Sophia blinked. "What?"

"Should I beg him to stay when he's in love with Isabella? Should I debase myself for a man who doesn't want me?" Evelyn countered.

"It's your fault he wants to leave. You failed as a wife," Sophia sneered.

"Our marriage is none of your concern."

"Do you think I care? If not for you, I would be Nathaniel's wife!" Sophia's voice cracked, her eyes glistening. "Why did you come back? Why take what was mine?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a humorless smile. "How bold—lusting after your sister's husband and acting righteous about it. You never fail to amaze me, Sophia."

Sophia's fists clenched. "You—"

"If you love him so much, beg Mother and Father. Arguing with me changes nothing." Evelyn sighed, weary.

Sophia fell silent.

With one last icy look, Evelyn slid into her car and drove off.

Behind her, Sophia stood seething, lips pressed into a thin line. She stomped her foot, frustration and hatred twisting her features.

No one knew how much she loathed Evelyn—her own sister.

###Chapter 9

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, her fingers brushing against the cool silk sheets where Nathaniel should have been. Empty. Again.

She sat up, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. The digital clock on the nightstand blinked 7:03 AM. Too early for him to be at the office already. A faint scent of his cologne lingered in the air, teasing her with his absence.

Downstairs, Alfred was setting the breakfast table with his usual precision. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted, pouring her a cup of steaming Earl Grey. "Mr. Martin left a note for you."

Evelyn took the crisp envelope, her name elegantly scrawled across it in Nathaniel's handwriting. Inside, a single line: "Emergency meeting. Will explain tonight. Love you."

Her stomach twisted. Emergency could mean anything—another crisis at Martin Group, or worse, her. Isabella. The woman who had haunted their marriage like a ghost.

The toast turned to ash in her mouth. She pushed the plate away just as her phone buzzed. A message from Gregory: "Meeting at 9. Client wants changes to the blueprints. Again."

Evelyn groaned. The Kensington project was bleeding them dry with endless revisions. She typed back: "On my way."

The drive to the office was a blur of honking cars and her own spiraling thoughts. Was Nathaniel lying? Had Isabella resurfaced? The last time she'd asked, he'd shut down, his jaw clenched in that infuriating way that meant drop it.

Gabrielle was waiting at her desk, a stack of files in her arms. "Mr. Wilson is already in the conference room. He looks... stressed."

Evelyn didn't doubt it. Gregory had been on edge since Danielle's relapse. She grabbed her tablet and hurried down the hall, where Gregory was pacing like a caged animal.

"They want to scrap the atrium," he said without preamble. "Says it's 'too modern' for the neighborhood."

Evelyn's grip tightened on her stylus. "It's the centerpiece of the entire design."

"I know. But Jonathan Blake is insisting. Summit Realty won't budge."

Sebastian Wilson's right-hand man. Of course. The man had hated their vision from day one. Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Fine. Let's see what we can salvage."

Three hours and four espresso shots later, they'd managed a compromise that didn't make her want to scream. She was reviewing the revisions when her phone lit up with a call from an unknown number.

"Evelyn Mitchell?" A woman's voice, smooth as velvet.

Her blood ran cold. "Who is this?"

A pause. Then, laughter like shattered glass. "Oh, you really don't recognize me? After everything Nathaniel's told you?"

The world tilted. Isabella.

"I have nothing to say to you," Evelyn hissed, fingers digging into the edge of her desk.

"Pity. Because I have so much to say to you." The line clicked dead.

Evelyn stared at the screen, her reflection pale in the black mirror.

Nathaniel's "emergency meeting" suddenly made perfect sense.

And it had nothing to do with Martin Group.

Evelyn hadn't eaten properly all day. By the time she returned to Pineview Villa, she requested the kitchen to prepare her favorite—creamy carbonara.

The rich aroma of the dish usually made her mouth water, but tonight, the moment the scent hit her, a wave of nausea crashed over her. Her stomach twisted violently.

Must be from skipping meals, she told herself. But as she lifted her fork, the nausea surged uncontrollably.

She barely made it to the bathroom before retching violently, her body trembling from the force of it. The sensation was unbearable, as if her insides were being wrung out.

When she finally straightened, wiping her mouth, she froze.

Nathaniel stood in the doorway, his piercing gaze locked onto her.

Her pulse spiked. "When did you get back?"

She hadn’t heard him enter.

His expression remained unreadable, but his voice was sharp. "What’s wrong with you?"

Evelyn forced a casual shrug. "Nothing serious."

"Nothing?" His frown deepened.

She managed a weak smile. "What else would it be?"

Her fingers twitched slightly, a nervous tell she quickly stilled.

Nathaniel noticed. His eyes narrowed, scrutinizing her as if peeling back layers of deception. After a weighted silence, he finally spoke.

"Evelyn. You’re not pregnant, are you?"

Not "Are you pregnant?" but "You’re not, are you?"

The distinction cut deeper than the question itself.

Her heart clenched painfully, as if squeezed by an invisible fist. He didn’t even consider the possibility.

Meeting his gaze, she countered softly, "And if I were? Would you let me keep it?"

"You couldn’t possibly be pregnant." His voice was steel, leaving no room for doubt.

The words stung. He never even imagined a future with me like that.

She swallowed the hurt, forcing a light laugh. "Then why ask? You’ve always been careful. Unless you’ve forgotten?"

Except for that one drunken night—buried in silence, never to be acknowledged.

Her expression stayed smooth, flawless.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened at her mocking tone. Something flickered in his eyes—something sharp, unsettling.

After a tense pause, he finally said, "If you’re sick, see a doctor. Should I have Samuel arrange it?"

She shook her head. "I’ll handle it myself."

His voice turned colder. "Your health isn’t something to neglect. Or do you need me to take you?"

Her laugh was brittle. "Nathaniel, we’re divorcing. Do you really think I should keep depending on you? Or would Isabella approve?"

Silence.

His face hardened, the warmth in his eyes vanishing entirely.

See? she told herself bitterly. You mean nothing. Only Isabella matters.

The quiet stretched until he finally broke it. "Did you tell your family about the divorce?"
###Chapter 10

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of our penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. I stretched beneath the silk sheets, my fingers brushing against the cold emptiness of Nathaniel's side of the bed. Again.

My phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. Three missed calls from Gregory.

"Evelyn, thank God," Gregory's voice crackled through the receiver the moment I answered. "The Summit Realty deal is falling apart. Sebastian Wilson just pulled out of our waterfront project."

I sat bolt upright, the sheets pooling around my waist. "What? We signed contracts last week!"

"Apparently Edward Martin made him a better offer," Gregory said darkly. "Your father-in-law's been poaching our clients systematically since the wedding."

The bitterness in my coffee suddenly matched the taste in my mouth. I should've seen this coming. Richard Martin had never approved of his heir marrying an architect with "questionable family connections," as he'd so delicately put it at our engagement party.

The penthouse elevator pinged just as I was buttoning my blouse. Nathaniel strode in, his tailored suit immaculate despite the early hour, carrying two steaming cups from my favorite café.

"You're awake," he murmured, pressing a kiss to my temple. The familiar scent of his cologne - bergamot and something distinctly masculine - should have soothed me. Instead, it made my throat tighten.

"We need to talk about your father," I said, accepting the coffee but setting it aside untouched.

Nathaniel's smile faded. He loosened his tie with one hand, a telltale sign of stress. "Let me guess. Summit Realty?"

"Isabella told you?" The name slipped out before I could stop it. His ex's involvement with Martin Group's acquisitions department had been a point of contention since day one.

His jaw tightened. "Don't."

"Don't what? Point out that your family is systematically destroying my career? That your father would rather bankrupt my firm than see me succeed?" My voice broke on the last word.

Nathaniel gripped my shoulders, his touch firm but gentle. "Listen to me. I have a solution." He reached into his briefcase and slid a folder across the kitchen island. "The Blackwood Estate renovation. It's yours if you want it."

I flipped open the file. The project was massive - a historic manor on fifty acres that would put my firm on the map. My breath caught at the renderings. "This is... but how? The Martins don't own Blackwood."

"Not yet." Nathaniel's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen and his expression darkened. "I have to take this. Think about it. The decision needs to be made by noon."

As he stepped onto the balcony, I caught the tail end of his conversation. "...told you to handle it discreetly, Samuel. If Isabella interferes again..."

The door clicked shut behind him, leaving me alone with the proposal and a growing sense of unease. The Blackwood project was everything I'd ever wanted. But at what cost? And why did I get the feeling Nathaniel wasn't telling me everything?

My phone buzzed again. Unknown number. The message contained a single photograph: Nathaniel and Isabella, heads bent close together at some dimly lit restaurant, taken last night. The timestamp read 11:47 PM.

Right around the time he'd claimed to be working late.

The elevator doors opened once more, but this time it was Alfred, our butler, looking uncharacteristically flustered. "Madam, there's a... situation at the lobby. A Ms. Davis is demanding to see Mr. Martin. She's quite insistent."

As if on cue, Isabella's shrill voice carried down the hallway. "I know he's here! Tell him if he doesn't come down right now, the whole world will know what really happened in Milan!"

The coffee cup slipped from my fingers, shattering against the marble like the fragile illusion of my marriage.

Evelyn lifted her gaze to meet Nathaniel's, her voice steady. "Yes, I've already told them."

"Why didn't you consult me first?" His tone was sharp, his expression unreadable, a storm of emotions brewing beneath the surface.

Evelyn studied him, perplexed. Why is Nathaniel reacting like this? Because I informed the Martins about our divorce without his approval?

She arched a brow. "What’s there to discuss? We’re finalizing everything on Monday, aren’t we? Since that’s settled, my family knowing shouldn’t concern you."

His jaw tightened. "Are you that eager to cut ties with me?"

The question caught her off guard. A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "Nathaniel, need I remind you? You were the one who brought up the divorce."

He’s the one desperate to be free of me.

Nathaniel’s frown deepened, his voice low and rough. "There was no need to rush. We could’ve waited until everything was official. Now my grandfather knows. We’re expected at the manor tonight."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, realization dawning. Ah. So that’s it. Edward found out, and now Nathaniel’s plans are disrupted.

She forced a calm smile. "Relax. I’ll handle Grandpa. He cares about me—he’ll understand."

Nathaniel’s gaze darkened as he took in her composed expression, the utter lack of hesitation in her words. An unfamiliar irritation coiled in his chest.

How can she be so indifferent?

Before the divorce, Evelyn had been warm, attentive. They’d never fought, never clashed. But since yesterday, she’d been nothing but cold, her words laced with quiet barbs.

Is it because I was the one who ended things first?

His eyes traced the delicate curve of her face, the effortless elegance that had always drawn attention. Evelyn wasn’t just beautiful—she was unforgettable.

A thought nagged at him, one he couldn’t shake.

What kind of man was her ex that she’d sacrifice our marriage for him?

Their arrangement had been clear from the start: he married to appease Edward; she married to sever ties with her past.

But now, the idea left a bitter taste in his mouth.

His voice dropped, rough with something unspoken. "Evelyn… after this, will you go back to him?"

She stilled, then let out a soft, incredulous breath. "No."

"Why not?"

Her gaze was distant. "What’s done is done. People move on. For all I know, he already has."

Nathaniel watched her closely, searching for any flicker of emotion. "He didn’t want to let you go back then. Maybe he’s still waiting."

Evelyn shrugged, her tone light but final. "People change. No one waits forever."

The words were as much a reminder to herself as they were to him.

If chasing leads nowhere, why keep running?

###Chapter 11

The morning sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work, as usual.

She sighed, rolling onto her back. The events of last night still lingered in her mind—the way Nathaniel had held her close after their argument, his whispered apologies, the warmth of his touch. It had been a rare moment of vulnerability between them.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory: "Meeting at 10. Don’t be late."

Evelyn groaned. She had completely forgotten about the client presentation. Throwing off the covers, she hurried to the bathroom, the cool tiles sending a shiver up her bare legs.

As she dressed, her thoughts drifted back to Nathaniel. Their marriage had been a whirlwind—love at first sight, a fairy-tale wedding, and then… reality. The late nights, the missed anniversaries, the growing distance. And now, Isabella was back in the picture.

Evelyn clenched her fists. She wouldn’t let Isabella ruin what she and Nathaniel had built.

Downstairs, Alfred was setting the breakfast table. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted with a polite nod.

"Morning, Alfred," she replied, grabbing a piece of toast. "Has Nathaniel left already?"

"Yes, ma'am. He mentioned an early meeting with Mr. Yates."

Of course. Work always came first.

Evelyn checked her watch. She had just enough time to review the presentation slides before heading to the office.

The drive downtown was uneventful, the city streets bustling with morning commuters. Her mind, however, was anything but calm. Isabella’s sudden reappearance had stirred up old insecurities. What if Nathaniel still had feelings for her?

The office building loomed ahead. Evelyn took a deep breath, steeling herself. She wouldn’t let personal drama affect her professionalism.

Gregory was waiting in the conference room, his expression unreadable. "Cutting it close, aren’t we?"

"Traffic," she lied smoothly, setting down her bag.

The meeting went surprisingly well. The clients loved their design proposal, and Gregory even cracked a rare smile.

Afterward, as they packed up, he glanced at her. "You okay? You seem… distracted."

Evelyn hesitated. "Just some personal stuff."

Gregory nodded, not pressing further. "Well, whatever it is, don’t let it mess with your work."

She forced a smile. "I won’t."

Back at her desk, Evelyn’s phone buzzed again. This time, it was a message from an unknown number: "We need to talk. It’s about Nathaniel. —I."

Her stomach dropped. Isabella.

Evelyn stared at the screen, her fingers trembling. What could Isabella possibly want?

Before she could respond, another message popped up: "Meet me at The Rose Café. 3 PM."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. This was it—the confrontation she’d been dreading.

She took a shaky breath. Whatever Isabella had to say, Evelyn would face it head-on.

But first, she had to get through the rest of the workday.

The clock on the wall ticked loudly, each second stretching into an eternity.

Three o’clock couldn’t come fast enough.

Evelyn thought to herself, This can only end in my own humiliation.

Nathaniel caught the strange undertone in her words. Is she talking about me? Or is this about something else entirely? Am I imagining things? He wondered silently.

Evelyn didn’t want to continue this conversation. She was afraid she wouldn’t be able to keep her emotions in check. Ever since yesterday, she had been repeating the same mantra in her head: Evelyn, stop hoping. There’s no point. There’s no future here. He will never love you. Everything you’ve done—every sacrifice—is meaningless, and worse, it might even push him further away.

She inhaled deeply, steadying herself before slipping back into her usual composed demeanor.

The two drove back to the Martin estate just as dusk settled over the hills.

The manor was nestled in the affluent outskirts of Mayby, where only the city’s elite resided.

Hand in hand, Evelyn and Nathaniel stepped into the grand living room, where Edward was already waiting. The moment he saw her, his stern face softened into a warm smile.

"Evelyn! You’re finally here. Come, let me see if you’ve lost weight. Has this grandson of mine been treating you well?"

She immediately released Nathaniel’s arm and hurried to Edward’s side, playfully massaging his shoulders. "Grandfather, I’m perfectly fine. If anything, I’ve gained weight! Maybe I should start watching what I eat."

Edward narrowed his eyes, feigning seriousness. "Nonsense. You’re perfect as you are. And don’t you dare starve yourself like those silly girls these days."

Evelyn laughed softly. "Alright, I promise. But you have to take care of yourself too, understand?"

"Hmph. You haven’t visited me in weeks," he grumbled, though his eyes twinkled with affection.

She bit her lip, realizing it had been nearly a month since her last visit. Edward wasn’t truly upset—he just wanted her to fuss over him.

With effortless charm, she had him laughing within minutes.

Nathaniel watched from the side, a faint smile on his lips. She really knows how to handle him.

He couldn’t help but wonder—what was it about Evelyn that made his grandfather adore her so much? More than his own flesh and blood, even.

"Grandfather," Nathaniel finally spoke, "next time, just invite Evelyn. No need to drag me along just to be ignored."

Edward’s smile vanished instantly. He shot his grandson a sharp glare. "What? You think you’re too important to visit your own grandfather now?"

Nathaniel sighed. "That’s not what I meant."

"It certainly sounds like it," Edward snapped. "You’ve grown too bold, boy. Defying me now, are you?"

Evelyn quickly stepped in, as she always did. "Grandfather, anger causes wrinkles. You wouldn’t want that, would you?"

Edward chuckled despite himself. "Always teasing me."

"I’m only speaking the truth," she replied sweetly.

"Don’t defend him," Edward warned, though his tone had softened. "Or he’ll keep taking advantage of you."

Nathaniel exhaled in exasperation. I didn’t even say anything. "Grandfather, I wouldn’t dare."

"You’d better not," Edward muttered.

The tension eased slightly, thanks to Evelyn’s intervention.

Soon after, Nathaniel’s parents—Richard and Victoria—arrived. Evelyn greeted them with effortless grace, charming them as effortlessly as she did Edward.

The family moved to the dining room, where the table was set for dinner.

Edward hadn’t touched his food yet, and everyone waited.

Then, in a voice that carried the weight of decades of authority, he spoke.

"Nathaniel. I heard from Evelyn’s parents that you want a divorce."

The air turned heavy.

All eyes shifted to Evelyn and Nathaniel.

She pressed her lips together, silent.

Nathaniel met his grandfather’s gaze steadily. "That’s between Evelyn and me. I’d appreciate it if you stayed out of it."

###Chapter 12

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples as she studied the blueprints spread before her. The Crestwood project was proving more challenging than anticipated, and the deadline loomed closer with each passing day.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Come in," she called, straightening her posture.

Gabrielle, her assistant, stepped inside, holding a steaming cup of coffee. "Thought you could use this," she said with a knowing smile.

Evelyn accepted it gratefully, the rich aroma instantly grounding her. "You're a lifesaver."

Gabrielle hesitated, then added, "Mr. Wilson called while you were in your meeting. He said the client wants to see revisions by the end of the week."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Of course they do." She took a sip of coffee, the warmth spreading through her. "Tell Gregory I’ll have them ready."

Just as Gabrielle turned to leave, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel lit up the screen:

"Dinner tonight? I have something to discuss."

Her fingers hovered over the screen. Their last conversation had been tense, filled with unspoken words and lingering doubts. Still, curiosity won out.

"Sure. Where?" she typed back.

His reply was immediate. "The usual place. 8 PM."

Evelyn set her phone down, her mind racing. What could he possibly want to talk about?

The evening air was crisp as Evelyn stepped out of her car, the familiar glow of La Belle Étoile welcoming her. The upscale restaurant had been their spot since the early days of their relationship—before secrets and past loves had complicated everything.

Nathaniel was already seated at their usual corner table, his dark suit impeccably tailored, his expression unreadable. He stood as she approached, pulling out her chair with practiced ease.

"You look beautiful," he murmured, his gaze lingering on her.

Evelyn smoothed her emerald-green dress, suddenly self-conscious. "Thank you."

A waiter appeared, pouring them each a glass of wine before discreetly retreating.

Nathaniel swirled his glass, the deep red liquid catching the candlelight. "I wanted to talk about Isabella."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her own glass. Of course. It always came back to her.

"She’s in town," he continued, his voice low. "And she wants to meet with you."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. "Me? Why?"

Nathaniel hesitated, his jaw tensing. "She says it’s important. About... the past."

The past. The words hung between them, heavy with unspoken implications.

Evelyn forced a steady breath. "When?"

"Tomorrow. If you’re willing."

She studied his face, searching for any hint of what he wasn’t saying. But Nathaniel had always been good at keeping his emotions locked away.

"Fine," she finally said. "I’ll meet her."

Nathaniel’s shoulders relaxed slightly, as if a weight had been lifted. "Thank you."

Evelyn took a sip of wine, the taste suddenly bitter. Whatever Isabella wanted, it wouldn’t be good. And deep down, she knew—this meeting would change everything.

Back at home, Evelyn stood by the window, staring at the city lights below. Her phone buzzed again—this time, a message from Charlotte.

"You okay? You seemed off earlier."

Evelyn sighed, typing back. "Just tired. Long day."

She didn’t mention Isabella. Didn’t mention the unease coiling in her stomach.

Because some things, she needed to face alone.

And tomorrow, she would.

"Are you accusing me of overstepping?" Edward's voice thundered through the dining room as his palm struck the table with a sharp crack.

Richard immediately stepped in, his tone firm. "Nathaniel, apologize to your grandfather at once. Take back what you said about the divorce."

Nathaniel remained silent, his expression unreadable, while Victoria watched the scene unfold with visible distress.

Edward scoffed, his eyes blazing. "So, you've grown bold, haven't you? Defying me now? If you want that divorce, you'll have to wait until I'm in my grave. As long as I draw breath, you will not marry Isabella."

His chest heaved with anger, his breaths turning ragged as a coughing fit seized him.

Evelyn rushed to his side, pressing a glass of water into his trembling hands. "Grandfather, please, calm down—"

He waved her off weakly. "Evelyn, I've failed your grandfather. Had I known Nathaniel would turn out so heartless, I never would have bound you to him."

Evelyn met his gaze steadily. "Grandfather, it isn't like that. The truth is... I want this too. We've been married a year, and there's nothing between us. I don’t want to keep pretending."

A stunned silence fell over the room.

She offered a small, regretful smile. "I’m sorry to disappoint you all. Nathaniel and I are ending things amicably. We won’t be husband and wife anymore, but nothing else has to change. Isn’t it better to part ways than to stay miserable?"

Edward’s face darkened, conflict flickering in his aged eyes.

"Evelyn," he rasped, "I can't give you an answer yet. I need time." He pushed himself up from the table, his cane thudding against the floor. "Go ahead with dinner. I need to rest."

Evelyn instinctively reached for his arm, but he gently shook her off, offering only a weary smile before retreating.

Richard followed, concern etched into his features.

Victoria sighed, casting a reproachful glance at Nathaniel before turning to Evelyn. "Sit, dear. Edward isn’t angry with you. He just... can’t bear to lose you."

Evelyn nodded, though guilt twisted in her chest.

From the corner of her eye, she caught Nathaniel’s stormy expression. He must be furious, she thought bitterly. Without Edward’s approval, he can’t marry Isabella.

The realization made her lips curl in a humorless smile.

Edward never returned. Richard later informed them he had taken his medication and retired for the night.

"Reconsider this," Richard urged quietly. "Marriage isn’t something to discard lightly. Feelings can grow with time. Do you really want to break your grandfather’s heart?"

Evelyn nodded again, though her thoughts churned. It’s not just my decision. If it were up to me alone... but forced love is no love at all.

The drive back to Pineview Villa was suffocatingly silent.

Memories of their early days together flickered through Evelyn’s mind—Nathaniel’s rare smiles, the warmth of his hand in hers. She wished, foolishly, that time could have frozen then.

Then his phone rang.

Nathaniel answered, and Isabella’s voice, bright and hopeful, pierced through the quiet. "Nathaniel, how did it go? Did Edward agree?"

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the seatbelt.

Of course he tells her everything. The thought was a blade twisting deeper. He loves her. Always has. And I was just... in the way.

She turned her face to the window, letting the night swallow her bitter smile.

###Chapter 13

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. The warmth of Nathaniel’s arm draped over her waist was comforting, but the events of last night still lingered in her mind like an unshakable shadow.

She carefully slipped out of bed, not wanting to wake him. The marble floor was cool beneath her bare feet as she padded toward the window, pulling back the curtains just enough to peer outside. The city was already alive, bustling with early risers and the hum of traffic.

A soft knock at the door startled her.

"Come in," she whispered.

Alfred, their ever-discreet butler, stepped inside with a tray of coffee and fresh pastries. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin. I thought you might appreciate some refreshments before the day begins."

"Thank you, Alfred," she murmured, accepting the tray.

He hesitated, then added, "Mr. Yates called earlier. He mentioned there’s an urgent matter requiring Mr. Martin’s attention at the office."

Evelyn’s grip tightened on the tray. "Did he say what it was about?"

Alfred shook his head. "Only that it was time-sensitive."

She exhaled slowly. Nathaniel had been working relentlessly lately, and she knew better than to assume it was just another business crisis. Not after what had happened with Isabella.

Setting the tray on the dresser, she turned back to the bed where Nathaniel still slept, his dark lashes casting faint shadows over his cheekbones. He looked peaceful, but she knew the storm brewing beneath the surface.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory.

"Evelyn, we need to talk. The Summit Realty deal is falling apart. Sebastian Wilson is making unreasonable demands."

She frowned. The Summit Realty project was supposed to be their biggest breakthrough—a chance to prove her firm’s worth beyond Nathaniel’s influence. If Sebastian was backing out now, after all the negotiations…

A hand brushed against her waist, pulling her from her thoughts.

"Morning," Nathaniel murmured, his voice rough with sleep.

She forced a smile. "Good morning. Samuel called—there’s something urgent at the office."

He sighed, sitting up and running a hand through his tousled hair. "Of course there is."

Evelyn hesitated before adding, "Gregory also messaged. There’s trouble with Summit Realty."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "Sebastian again?"

She nodded.

He reached for his phone, already shifting into problem-solving mode. "I’ll handle it."

Evelyn placed a hand on his arm. "No. This is my project. Let me deal with it."

Their eyes locked—a silent battle of wills.

Finally, Nathaniel exhaled. "Fine. But if he gives you any trouble, you call me immediately."

She smirked. "I can handle Sebastian Wilson."

Nathaniel’s lips curved into a slow, dangerous smile. "I know you can. That’s what worries me."

The tension between them shifted, charged with something deeper.

Then his phone rang again, shattering the moment.

He glanced at the screen, and his expression hardened. "It’s Richard."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. His father never called unless it was bad news.

Nathaniel answered, his voice clipped. "What is it?"

She watched as his jaw tightened, his knuckles whitening around the phone.

When he finally hung up, his gaze met hers, stormy and unreadable.

"We need to go to the estate. Now."

Evelyn didn’t ask why. She already knew.

The Martins’ secrets were about to unravel.

Evelyn's eyes were distant, fixed on the passing scenery outside the car window. Nathaniel's voice, soft yet firm, pulled her back. "Don't overanalyze this. I promise they’ll adore you. Just focus on taking care of yourself, and leave everything else to me. Understood?"

A beat later, he ended the call.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, her tone measured. "Tell Isabella she has nothing to worry about. I won’t stand in your way. I’ll do everything I can to convince Edward to approve the divorce. Honestly, I’m more eager for this than you are."

She couldn’t delay any longer. The pregnancy was a ticking time bomb—one Nathaniel would discover sooner or later.

Nathaniel’s brows knitted together. He turned to study her profile. "Isabella was just making conversation. There’s no need to react like this. Divorce or not, my door will always be open for you. That’s a promise."

Evelyn’s expression remained unreadable. "I’m not reacting. It’s not worth the energy."

His jaw tightened. "Are you really in such a rush to end this?"

"Aren’t you?" she countered coolly, still refusing to meet his gaze.

Nathaniel watched the way the sunlight caught the curve of her cheekbone. "If that’s true, why wait until now to bring it up?"

Evelyn hesitated. Her lips pressed into a thin line before she shrugged. "No particular reason."

If only she could pinpoint the exact moment she’d fallen for him, maybe she could unravel this mess.

Nathaniel didn’t press further. He checked his watch. "Come with me to the hospital. Afterward, I’ll have the driver take you home."

"No. Just drop me here." Her refusal was immediate.

"We’re already near the hospital. It’s on the way," he reasoned. "I’m not reading into this. If it bothers you, I’ll have you taken home first."

"Don’t trouble yourself. I’ll grab a cab. Isabella’s waiting. You should go."

Few women would shove their husbands toward another woman like this. But Evelyn had no choice.

Even if she didn’t, Nathaniel would still leave.

"Fine. Suit yourself." His tone was icy as he signaled the driver to pull over.

Alone in the taxi, Evelyn returned to Pineview Villa.

By eight, she was already at her desk, laptop open. She dove into the investigation—tracing the anonymous accounts that had accused her firm of design theft. Hours of meticulous digging led her to an unsettling discovery.

The accuser was a decades-old construction company, reputable but unremarkable. At first glance, their design and hers bore striking similarities. But any professional would spot the glaring differences upon closer inspection.

That was the trap. Most outsiders wouldn’t know better.

Even with Gregory’s reassurance, the weight of the accusation pressed on her. "We know it’s original. That’s all that matters," he said during their late-night call.

Evelyn hummed in agreement, masking her unease. In their world, a plagiarism label stuck—truth be damned.

Gregory sighed. "I’ll reach out to some contacts at that firm. Don’t carry this alone. Whatever happens, I’ve got your back."

"Thanks, Gregory."

"Always."

She forced a smile before shifting gears. "We should also look into our own team."

His voice sharpened. "You think there’s a mole?"

The question hung between them, heavy with implication.
###Chapter 14

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She rubbed her temples, trying to focus on the blueprints in front of her, but her mind kept drifting back to last night's argument with Nathaniel.

"You're always putting work before us," he had said, his voice tight with frustration.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, pushing the memory aside. She couldn't afford distractions—not with the Summit Realty project deadline looming.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Evelyn?" Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Gregory strode in moments later, his usual confident demeanor slightly off. He dropped a thick folder onto her desk.

"We have a problem."

Evelyn flipped it open. Inside were photos of the construction site—materials misplaced, half-finished walls, workers standing idle.

"What happened?"

"Sebastian Wilson happened," Gregory muttered. "He's been pressuring the contractors to cut corners. If we don't intervene, this project will collapse before we even break ground."

Evelyn's grip tightened on the papers. Summit Realty was her firm's biggest contract yet. Failure wasn't an option.

"I'll handle it."

Gregory hesitated. "You sure? Sebastian isn't exactly... reasonable."

She met his gaze. "Neither am I."

Nathaniel stared at his phone screen, thumb hovering over Evelyn's contact. He should call her. Apologize. But pride held him back.

"Mr. Martin?" Samuel, his secretary, entered the study. "Your grandfather requests your presence in the garden."

Nathaniel frowned. Edward rarely summoned him so formally.

He found the old man seated beneath the willow tree, a chessboard between them.

"Sit," Edward commanded.

Nathaniel obeyed.

"You're distracted," Edward observed, moving a pawn. "Your wife?"

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. "It's nothing."

Edward chuckled. "Love is never nothing, boy." He leaned forward. "Tell me, what's more important—your ego or your marriage?"

The question struck deeper than Nathaniel expected.

Before he could answer, his phone buzzed. A news alert flashed:

Breaking: Summit Realty Project Under Scrutiny—Construction Delays Spark Investor Concerns.

Nathaniel's blood ran cold. Evelyn was in trouble.

And suddenly, the answer to his grandfather's question was crystal clear.

Evelyn murmured, "Perhaps. We should be cautious."

"Alright, I'll look into it." Gregory seemed hesitant.

But Evelyn didn't catch his hesitation, assuming he was just exhausted. She urged him to rest early and ended their conversation.

After shutting down her laptop, she grabbed her phone. The clock read past ten—Nathaniel likely wouldn't return tonight.

Then his warning flashed through her mind. He expects me to stay away from men before the divorce, but what about him? Does he follow his own rules?

Her lips pressed into a thin line as she dialed Nathaniel.

The call connected almost instantly—but instead of his voice, a soft, feminine tone answered. "Evelyn? It's Isabella. What do you need?"

Evelyn stiffened. Of course. Nathaniel trusts her enough to let her handle his phone.

Her grip tightened. "Put Nathaniel on," she demanded coldly.

Isabella sighed. "I'm sorry, he can't come to the phone right now. Maybe try again later?"

"I'll wait."

"Evelyn, I'm not refusing you. Nathaniel is—"

"Just tell him to pick up," Evelyn snapped.

Isabella glanced at the closed hospital room door—Nathaniel had stepped out to discuss her discharge with the doctor. A sly smile curled her lips as she lied, "He's in the shower. I don’t know when he’ll be done, so..."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Her fingers trembled around the phone.

Wake up. They’re already this close. He demands distance from me while clinging to her. How hypocritical.

Her voice turned icy. "Fine. I won’t disturb you."

She hung up before Isabella could respond, afraid her composure would shatter if she waited another second.

The truth was clear now. Nathaniel’s rules weren’t about protecting her reputation—only his own. He never cared if she became the subject of gossip.

A bitter laugh escaped her. If I were Isabella, he’d never treat me like this, would he?

But there were no what-ifs.

In the hospital room, Isabella stared at Nathaniel’s phone, then swiftly deleted the call log and placed it back.

The door creaked open. Nathaniel walked in, frowning at her uneasy expression. "Are you feeling worse?"

She shook her head, forcing a bright smile. "What did the doctor say?"

"Rest well, and you can leave in two days. I’ll arrange a place for you."

"Perfect. I’ll listen to you."

He nodded absently, checking his phone. No notifications.

"It’s late. Get some sleep," he said, tucking the device away. "I’ll visit tomorrow."

Isabella clutched his sleeve, her eyes glistening. "Nathaniel… I’m scared to stay alone. Can’t you—"

"No." His voice was firm. "I’m still married. Rumors won’t do you any favors. The caretaker will arrive soon. Behave."

Her lip quivered. "You will divorce her, right? I just… I feel so insecure. What if you fall for her again? She’s—"

"My grandfather needs convincing. That’s all." His tone brooked no argument. "Focus on recovering."

"Then stay tonight," she pleaded.

Nathaniel’s expression remained unreadable. "I can’t."

The door clicked shut behind him, leaving Isabella seething in the silence.
###Chapter 15

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn’s office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. She traced a finger along the lines of the design, her mind racing with possibilities. The Pineview Villa project was her biggest challenge yet, and she refused to let anything—or anyone—derail her focus.

A sharp knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, not looking up.

The door swung open, and Gregory stepped inside, his usual confident stride slightly hesitant. "Evelyn, we need to talk."

She finally glanced up, her brows knitting together at the tension in his voice. "What’s wrong?"

He exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. "Summit Realty just pulled out of the deal. Sebastian Wilson called me personally. He said they’re shifting their investments elsewhere."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. "What? That doesn’t make sense. We were finalizing the contracts yesterday."

Gregory shook his head. "I don’t know what changed, but he was adamant. No explanations, just a flat refusal."

She clenched her fists, frustration bubbling beneath her skin. Summit Realty had been their key investor. Without them, the project was in jeopardy.

Then, a chilling thought struck her.

"Isabella."

Gregory frowned. "What about her?"

Evelyn’s lips pressed into a thin line. "She’s been circling Nathaniel again. What if she’s behind this?"

Before Gregory could respond, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel lit up the screen:

"We need to talk. Tonight. Alone."

Her heart pounded. Something was wrong.

Gregory noticed her expression. "What is it?"

She swallowed hard. "I think the game just changed."

The Martin estate loomed before her as Evelyn stepped out of the car, the evening air thick with tension. Alfred greeted her at the door, his usual composed demeanor tinged with unease.

"Mr. Martin is waiting for you in the study," he murmured.

She nodded, her heels clicking against the marble floor as she made her way through the grand hallway. The door to the study was slightly ajar. She pushed it open.

Nathaniel stood by the fireplace, his back to her, shoulders rigid.

"You wanted to see me," she said, keeping her voice steady.

He turned slowly, his dark eyes unreadable. "Summit Realty withdrew from your project."

She stiffened. "I know."

His jaw tightened. "Did you know Isabella met with Sebastian Wilson yesterday?"

The confirmation hit her like a punch to the gut.

Evelyn forced herself to breathe. "I suspected as much."

Nathaniel stepped closer, his voice low and dangerous. "She’s playing a dangerous game. And she’s using you to get to me."

Evelyn met his gaze, defiance sparking in her chest. "Then let’s not give her what she wants."

A slow, calculating smile curved his lips. "I was hoping you’d say that."

The air between them crackled with unspoken plans.

Isabella had made her move.

Now, it was their turn.

Nathaniel stood motionless, his expression unreadable.

Seeing him like this, Isabella hesitated. She truly didn’t want to cause any trouble or arguments with Nathaniel. After all, this was a critical time—he was in the middle of divorcing Evelyn.

But Isabella couldn’t resist testing his resolve.

Her fingers tightened slightly around his sleeve. "Nathaniel, stay with me tonight. Just one night. I want you here."

Nathaniel’s gaze remained cold, a flicker of impatience in his eyes. "Isabella, think carefully. If word gets out that I stayed overnight, the media will twist it. I don’t care about rumors, but you will. My grandfather and parents already disapprove of you. Do you really want to give them another reason?"

Isabella bit her lip, then reluctantly let go.

As much as she hated backing down, she couldn’t risk angering him.

Ever since she woke up, no matter how late she called, Nathaniel would come—but he never stayed. It unsettled her. If he truly loved her, wouldn’t he want to be with her all the time?

Still, she told herself he was only protecting her reputation.

After leaving the hospital, Nathaniel drove straight to the exclusive Vermillion Club.

He and a few close friends owned the place, a high-end establishment frequented by Mayby’s elite.

Nathaniel had his own private lounge there. When he arrived, his friends were already waiting, drinks in hand.

As he took his seat, one of them—Thomas Ellsworth—poured him a glass of whiskey. "So, what’s the plan once Isabella’s discharged?"

Nathaniel lit a cigarette, exhaling slowly. "Once she’s fully recovered, my marriage to Evelyn ends. Then I’ll marry Isabella."

"You’re really going through with the divorce?" Thomas knew better than anyone how Nathaniel and Evelyn interacted. There was still something between them—Evelyn’s eyes softened whenever she looked at him.

Nathaniel nodded. "It’s decided."

Thomas raised a brow. "I don’t get it. Evelyn’s stunning, talented, and you’ve lived together for a year. How do you feel nothing?"

The others chuckled. "Maybe he’s just that devoted to Isabella." They watched as Nathaniel took a long drag from his cigarette.

Nathaniel’s voice was flat. "Maybe."

A strange irritation coiled in his chest. He exhaled a cloud of smoke, obscuring his expression.

Evelyn’s face flashed in his mind—her quiet grace, the way she never complained, no matter how cold he was. But lately, she had changed. Distant. Defiant.

Thomas sighed. "Well, Isabella did nearly die for you. And Evelyn’s young, beautiful—she’ll remarry easily. That Gregory Wilson seems pretty taken with her. Once you’re divorced, they’ll probably—"

"Enough." Nathaniel’s voice was sharp. "Even if we divorce, Evelyn remains under my family’s protection. I won’t tolerate jokes about her."

Thomas shook his head. "Nathaniel, that’s the reality. Once the papers are signed, she’s no longer your concern."
###Chapter 16

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn’s office, casting a golden glow over the blueprints spread across her desk. She traced a finger along the sketched lines of the new luxury resort, her mind racing with ideas. The project was ambitious—one that could redefine her career.

A sharp knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Evelyn?" Gregory Wilson, her business partner, leaned against the doorframe, his usual confident demeanor slightly strained. "We have a problem."

She frowned. "What is it?"

"The investors are getting cold feet. Summit Realty is pushing for revisions, and they’re threatening to pull funding if we don’t comply."

Evelyn’s grip tightened on her pen. "Sebastian Wilson is behind this, isn’t he?"

Gregory nodded grimly. "He’s been circling this project for months. If we lose Summit’s backing, we’re done."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. She had fought too hard to let this slip away. "Set up a meeting. I’ll handle Sebastian myself."

Nathaniel Martin stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows of his penthouse, staring at the city skyline. His phone buzzed—another message from Isabella.

We need to talk. It’s urgent.

He ignored it, just as he had the last three.

The past had a way of clawing its way back when he least expected it. Isabella’s sudden reappearance was a complication he didn’t need, not when his marriage to Evelyn was already hanging by a thread.

His secretary, Samuel Yates, cleared his throat from the doorway. "Sir, your grandfather is on line one."

Nathaniel clenched his jaw. Edward Martin never called unless it was important—or an ambush.

He picked up the phone. "Grandfather."

"Benjamin," Edward’s voice was sharp. "The board is questioning your leadership. The Summit deal is falling apart, and your personal distractions aren’t helping."

Nathaniel’s grip on the phone tightened. "I have it under control."

"Do you?" Edward’s tone was icy. "Because from where I’m standing, it looks like you’re losing everything."

The line went dead.

Nathaniel set the phone down slowly. He had built an empire, but one misstep could bring it all crashing down.

And right now, he was dangerously close to the edge.

Evelyn stepped into the dimly lit bar, scanning the room until her eyes landed on Sebastian Wilson. He sat in a secluded booth, a glass of whiskey in hand, looking every bit the predator she knew him to be.

She straightened her shoulders and walked over.

"Sebastian."

He glanced up, a slow smirk spreading across his face. "Evelyn Mitchell. To what do I owe the pleasure?"

She slid into the seat opposite him. "Cut the games. What do you want?"

His fingers tapped against his glass. "Straight to the point. I like that." He leaned forward. "I want you off the project."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. "Not happening."

Sebastian’s smirk widened. "Then say goodbye to your funding."

She held his gaze, refusing to back down. "There’s always another way."

"Is there?" He tilted his head. "Because from where I’m sitting, you’re out of options."

Evelyn’s phone buzzed—a message from Nathaniel.

We need to talk.

Her stomach twisted.

One crisis at a time.

She stood, meeting Sebastian’s calculating stare. "This isn’t over."

His laughter followed her out the door.

Nathaniel paced his office, his mind a storm of frustration and regret. The door opened, and Evelyn walked in, her expression unreadable.

"You wanted to talk," she said flatly.

He stopped, facing her. "We can’t keep doing this."

Her eyes flashed. "Doing what, Nathaniel? Pretending we’re fine? Because we’re not."

The truth hung between them, heavy and suffocating.

He took a step closer. "Then let’s fix it."

Evelyn shook her head. "Some things can’t be fixed."

The words cut deeper than he expected.

Before he could respond, his phone rang—Isabella again.

Evelyn’s gaze dropped to the screen, and something in her expression shattered.

"I see how it is," she whispered.

Then she turned and walked out.

Nathaniel stared after her, the weight of his mistakes pressing down on him.

He had spent years building walls.

Now, they were crumbling—and taking everything with them.

Thomas spoke the truth. He added, "Even if Sir Edward favors Evelyn, she's still an outsider. Perhaps he'll encourage her to marry Gregory instead."

A strange sense of reality settled over Thomas.

Nathaniel's expression darkened instantly, the air around him turning icy. He didn’t want to continue the conversation. Instead, he grabbed the wine glass in front of him and downed it in one swift motion.

Evelyn tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep. It felt like tiny ants were gnawing at her heart—not painful, but unbearable.

She resolved to visit Martin Manor first thing in the morning to speak with Edward and put an end to this miserable marriage as soon as possible.

Just as she closed her eyes, forcing herself to rest, her phone rang. Nathaniel’s name flashed on the screen.

Why is he calling now?

She hesitated before answering. "Hello?"

"Evelyn? It's Thomas. Nathaniel’s drunk at Fihige Club. Come get him."

"Fihige Club?" Evelyn frowned in surprise.

Wasn’t he supposed to be with Isabella at the hospital? She said he was in the shower—didn’t that mean he was staying the night?

Her lips pressed into a thin line. She had no desire to fetch Nathaniel from the club. The thought of what might have happened between him and Isabella at the hospital made her stomach churn.

"Thomas, can’t you drive him back? I’m not coming," she said flatly.

"He’s your husband. We’re all too drunk to drive. If you don’t come, I’ll just leave him here. Plenty of women would jump at the chance to take care of him—who knows what might happen?" Without waiting for a response, Thomas hung up.

Evelyn clenched her fists, torn. Reluctantly, she grabbed her keys and headed out.

She knew exactly which private room they were in. Pushing the door open, she found the space eerily quiet, with only Nathaniel sprawled across the sofa.

The scent of alcohol clung to him as she approached.

"Nathaniel… Nathaniel… Are you awake?" she whispered.

No response.

Her lips thinned in irritation. Weren’t you supposed to be comforting Isabella? Did she kick you out because you’re still technically married to me?

Nathaniel had always been so indulgent with Isabella.

She tried to lift him, but he was too heavy. Worried about the baby, she called for a waiter to help carry him to the car.

The night breeze drifted through the open window as she drove back to Pineview Villa. When she opened the back door, she was met with Nathaniel’s sharp, sobering gaze.

"You’re awake?" she asked, startled.

"Did you not want to come get me?" His voice was low, rough.

Evelyn exhaled. "No."

"Then why the long face?"

"That’s just how I look," she replied coolly.

"You’re lying, Evelyn. You were never like this before. When I was drunk, you’d rush to bring me home and make honey water." His tone carried a hint of accusation.

She stared at him, incredulous. He remembers that, but not the mess we’re in now?

"Nathaniel, we’re getting divorced. I won’t be doing those things anymore."

"Stop saying that," he snapped, his expression darkening. "Aren’t you tired of repeating it?"

Evelyn let out a humorless laugh. The truth annoyed him—or maybe it was the reminder that he wasn’t free yet.
###Chapter 17

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, blinking against the light as she turned to find Nathaniel already awake, his piercing blue eyes fixed on her.

"You're staring," she murmured, a soft smile playing on her lips.

"Can't help it," he admitted, brushing a stray lock of hair from her face. "You're beautiful."

A warmth spread through her chest, but before she could respond, his phone buzzed on the nightstand. Nathaniel frowned as he picked it up, his expression darkening.

"What is it?" Evelyn asked, sitting up.

"Work," he muttered, though the tension in his jaw suggested it was more than that.

She knew better than to press him—Nathaniel had always been guarded about Martin Group affairs—but the unease in his demeanor unsettled her.

Downstairs, Alfred had already prepared breakfast. The scent of freshly brewed coffee and buttery croissants filled the air, but Nathaniel barely touched his plate.

"You should eat," Evelyn said gently.

"I'm not hungry." His tone was clipped, distant.

Before she could say more, his phone rang again. This time, he answered, his voice low and controlled. "What do you mean, the deal's falling through?"

Evelyn sipped her coffee, watching as he paced the length of the dining room, his frustration palpable. When he finally hung up, his knuckles were white around the phone.

"Everything okay?" she ventured.

"No." He exhaled sharply. "Summit Realty is backing out of the waterfront project."

Her stomach dropped. That project was crucial—not just for Martin Group, but for her own firm’s collaboration with them.

"Is there anything I can do?"

Nathaniel shook his head. "I need to handle this myself."

She reached for his hand, squeezing it. "You don’t have to do everything alone."

For a brief moment, his gaze softened. Then, just as quickly, his walls went back up. "I’ll be late tonight. Don’t wait up."

And with that, he was gone, leaving Evelyn sitting at the table, her breakfast untouched.

The silence stretched, heavy with unspoken tension.

Then, her phone buzzed—a message from Gregory.

"We need to talk. Meet me at the office ASAP."

Evelyn frowned. Gregory never sent urgent messages unless something was wrong.

Grabbing her bag, she headed out, her mind racing.

Whatever was happening, it was bigger than she realized.

And she had a sinking feeling it was about to get much worse.

The silence between them was thick enough to cut with a knife. Nathaniel stepped out of the car, his polished shoes clicking against the marble steps as he strode into the villa. Without a word, he disappeared into the master bedroom.

The air in the room was heavy, suffocating. The windows were shut tight, trapping the scent of whiskey and tobacco around them. Evelyn wrinkled her nose, the pungent mix making her stomach churn. "Do you want to shower?" she asked quietly, her fingers twisting the hem of her sweater.

His dark eyes flickered toward her, cold and unreadable. "What, you think I already did?"

"Didn’t you?"

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "If you have something to say, say it. I told you—I won’t cross any lines before the divorce is final."

Evelyn scoffed. "How would I know? I’m not your shadow."

A slow, dangerous smirk curled his lips. "You could be, starting tomorrow."

"No." She turned away, feigning indifference. "You didn’t shower at the hospital?"

His brows furrowed. "It’s a hospital, Evelyn. Not a spa."

She studied him, suspicion gnawing at her. Did Isabella lie to me? Swallowing hard, she murmured, "I called you earlier. Isabella answered. She said you were in the shower."

"Did she?" His voice was flat.

Evelyn’s lips pressed into a thin line. He’s defending her already. "I’m not lying."

"I didn’t say you were."

Exhaustion weighed on her. "Forget it. It’s late. Just shower and go to bed." She moved past him, but his hand shot out, fingers wrapping around her wrist like a vice.

In one swift motion, he yanked her against his chest. The heat of his body seared through her clothes, his heartbeat a steady drum beneath her palm. She knew this body too well—the hard planes of muscle, the way his skin burned under her touch.

Her cheeks flamed. "Let go."

Nathaniel tilted her chin up, his breath warm against her lips. "You’re still my wife, Evelyn. Don’t you know what that means?"

Her pulse stuttered. "We’re getting divorced."

"Not yet." He leaned in, his mouth hovering just above hers.

She jerked back. "I don’t want this."

His grip tightened, his eyes turning glacial. "As long as you wear my ring, you’ll act like my wife."

Evelyn laughed bitterly. "What’s the difference? Or are you worried Isabella will find out and think you’re cheating?"

His expression darkened. "This has nothing to do with her."

"Doesn’t it? She’s the one you love, isn’t she?"

"Stop using her as an excuse," he snapped.

Evelyn’s chest ached. He can’t even stand me mentioning her. How deep does his love run? She swallowed the lump in her throat. "Fine. I won’t bring her up again."

Her submission didn’t soothe him. If anything, it made the tension worse.

By the time Nathaniel emerged from the shower, Evelyn was curled on her side, pretending to sleep. He stood over her, watching the steady rise and fall of her shoulders. Who is this woman? The Evelyn he married had been soft, pliant. This version was all sharp edges and defiance.

Was it the divorce? Was she finally showing her true colors?

Nathaniel clenched his fists. He didn’t understand her at all.

###Chapter 18

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting delicate patterns across the hardwood floor. Evelyn stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the cool silk sheets where Nathaniel should have been. Empty. Again.

She sighed, rolling onto her back. The digital clock on the nightstand blinked 7:03 AM in bold red numbers. Too early for his usual meetings. Where was he?

The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up from downstairs. Alfred must already be up. Evelyn slipped out of bed, her bare feet padding softly against the plush carpet. She grabbed her robe from the chaise lounge, wrapping it tightly around herself as she made her way to the en suite bathroom.

The reflection in the mirror startled her. Dark circles shadowed her usually bright eyes, evidence of another restless night. She turned on the faucet, splashing cold water on her face. The shock of it helped clear the fog in her mind.

Downstairs, the mansion was eerily quiet. Only the grandfather clock in the foyer ticked steadily, marking the passage of time. Alfred stood by the dining table, arranging a single place setting.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted with his usual impeccable timing. "Would you like breakfast now?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Just coffee, thank you. Have you seen Nathaniel this morning?"

Alfred's expression remained carefully neutral. "Mr. Martin left quite early. He mentioned an urgent matter at the office."

She accepted the steaming cup from him, the rich aroma doing little to soothe her unease. Something was off. Nathaniel had been distant for days, canceling dinners, coming home late. The excuses were piling up, and her patience was wearing thin.

Her phone buzzed on the marble countertop. A text from Gregory: Emergency meeting at 9. Client wants major revisions. Can you come in early?

Evelyn groaned. Just what she needed. She fired off a quick reply before heading back upstairs to get ready. As she passed Nathaniel's study, a glint of metal caught her eye. His laptop sat open on the desk, screen dark but not powered off.

She hesitated. It was unlike him to leave it like that. Against her better judgment, she stepped inside and tapped the spacebar. The screen flickered to life, displaying an email thread with the subject line: Urgent: Isabella Davis Contract Negotiations

Her breath hitched. Isabella. The name alone sent a chill down her spine. Nathaniel's ex. The woman who'd nearly destroyed their marriage before it even began.

Evelyn's fingers hovered over the trackpad. She shouldn't. This was a violation of trust. But the gnawing suspicion in her gut won out. She scrolled.

The emails were professional, discussing a potential partnership between Martin Group and Isabella's new interior design firm. But the timestamp on the last message—sent at 2:17 AM—made her stomach twist. What business required discussing in the middle of the night?

A car door slammed outside, startling her. She quickly closed the laptop and stepped away just as the front door opened.

"Evelyn?" Nathaniel's voice echoed through the house.

She forced a smile as she met him in the hallway. "You're back early."

His tie was loosened, hair slightly disheveled as if he'd been running his hands through it. "Forgot some documents," he said, brushing past her toward the study.

The scent of another woman's perfume—something floral and expensive—lingered in his wake. Evelyn's hands clenched into fists at her sides.

"By the way," she called after him, her voice deceptively light. "Who's Isabella Davis?"

Nathaniel froze. The tension in his shoulders was unmistakable. When he turned to face her, his expression was carefully blank. "An old acquaintance. Why do you ask?"

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Just curious. Saw her name pop up on your laptop."

His jaw tightened. "Business. Nothing more."

"At two in the morning?"

Nathaniel's eyes darkened. "You went through my emails?"

The accusation hung between them, thick and suffocating. Evelyn held his gaze, her heart pounding. This was it. The moment the cracks in their marriage became a chasm.

Before either could speak again, her phone rang. Gregory. The real world intruding on their standoff.

She answered without breaking eye contact with Nathaniel. "I'll be there in twenty."

Hanging up, she stepped closer to her husband. "We're not done here," she whispered before turning on her heel and walking away.

The drive to the office was a blur. Evelyn gripped the steering wheel until her knuckles turned white, replaying the confrontation in her mind. The lies. The defensiveness. The scent of another woman on her husband.

By the time she pulled into the parking garage, one thing was clear: Nathaniel was hiding something. And she would find out what, even if it destroyed them both.

The first golden rays of dawn streamed through the curtains of Pineview Villa, painting the bedroom in warm hues.

Evelyn stirred awake to the persistent beeping of her alarm. Still half-asleep, she stretched—only for her fingers to brush against firm, heated skin. Her eyes flew open in shock.

Nathaniel lay beside her, his sculpted features relaxed in sleep. She was curled against his chest, his arm draped possessively around her waist.

Before she could process this, his deep voice rumbled against her ear, rough with sleep. "Morning, sweetheart."

"You—why are you still here?" she demanded, trying to wriggle free.

"You looked so peaceful. I didn’t have the heart to move." His lips curved into that infuriating smirk.

"Liar."

His grip tightened. "You clung to me like a vine. I couldn’t pry you off if I tried." His breath fanned over her face, sending heat creeping up her neck. The air between them thickened.

Nathaniel’s gaze dropped to her lips. "You spend the night in my arms, then act like you can’t wait to escape. How cruel."

"Let go of me." She shoved at his chest—uselessly.

Instead, he hauled her closer, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Promise me one thing, Evelyn. No jumping into another man’s arms after the divorce. They’ll only want you for your connections."

She scoffed. "Since when do you dictate my life?"

"This isn’t a negotiation." His fingers flexed against her hip. "Promise me."

"Or what?" she challenged.

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened. He leaned in until their noses brushed. "Or I’ll kiss you until you forget your own name."

Her breath hitched. Since when had he become so blatant?

"You wouldn’t dare."

"Try me." His thumb traced her bottom lip, igniting sparks under her skin. "Unless you secretly want me to?"

"Delusional," she snapped, but her pulse betrayed her.

Nathaniel didn’t miss it. With a low chuckle, he closed the distance—

Evelyn twisted away. "This is ridiculous!"

"Then agree." His mouth hovered a breath from hers. "Unless you’d rather I prove how serious I am?"

She glared. "You’re impossible."

"And you’re stubborn." His hand slid up her spine, trapping her. "Last chance."

The tension crackled. Evelyn opened her mouth—

Nathaniel claimed it in a searing kiss.

###Chapter 19

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort in the Maldives. The design was ambitious, but she thrived on challenges.

A knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn nodded. "Send him in."

Gregory Wilson strode in, his usual confident demeanor slightly off. He dropped into the chair opposite her, running a hand through his hair. "We have a problem."

She arched a brow. "What kind of problem?"

"The Martin Group just pulled funding from our joint venture."

Her stomach twisted. "Nathaniel approved this?"

Gregory shook his head. "Not directly. It came from higher up—Edward Martin."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Of course. The old man had never fully accepted her, despite her marriage to Nathaniel. She tapped her pen against the desk. "We need to salvage this. Any alternatives?"

"Not unless we find another investor fast."

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel: We need to talk. Dinner tonight?

Her fingers hovered over the screen. Was this about the funding? Or something else?

Before she could reply, another notification popped up—an email from Summit Realty. The subject line made her pulse quicken: Exclusive Partnership Opportunity.

She clicked it open. Sebastian Wilson, the CEO, proposed a collaboration on a high-profile urban renewal project. The terms were generous. Too generous?

Gabrielle cleared her throat. "Everything okay?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Just another curveball."

But her mind raced. Was this a lifeline—or a trap?

Meanwhile, across town, Nathaniel sat in his grandfather’s study, facing Edward’s steely gaze.

"You’re making a mistake," Nathaniel said, his voice tight.

Edward sipped his whiskey. "Business isn’t personal, boy. That resort isn’t viable."

"It’s Evelyn’s project."

"Exactly." Edward set down his glass. "She’s talented, but sentiment has no place in our decisions."

Nathaniel clenched his jaw. He’d fought this battle before. But this time, the stakes were higher.

Because Evelyn wouldn’t back down. And neither would he.

As evening fell, Evelyn arrived at their penthouse, her heels clicking against the marble floor. Nathaniel stood by the window, his silhouette tense against the city lights.

She crossed her arms. "So. Are we discussing the resort—or your grandfather’s latest power play?"

He turned, his expression unreadable. "Both."

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Then the doorbell rang.

Nathaniel frowned. "We’re not expecting anyone."

Evelyn opened the door—and froze.

Isabella Davis stood there, flawless as ever, a smirk playing on her lips. "Long time no see, Evelyn."

Her stomach dropped.

Isabella’s gaze slid past her to Nathaniel. "We need to talk. It’s urgent."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened on the doorframe. Whatever this was, it wouldn’t be good.

And just like that, the night took a sharp turn into chaos.

Nathaniel's voice was low but firm. "If you agree, I'll let you go."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, a flicker of reluctance crossing her features.

Nathaniel continued, his tone edged with something dangerous. "Say yes. You know how a man is in the morning."

She wasn’t naive. The implication was clear, and it made her cheeks burn.

How can he be so shameless?

Before she could react, Nathaniel leaned in, his lips dangerously close to hers. Evelyn jerked her head away, her pulse racing. "I know," she said quickly.

His brow arched. "Know what? Say it clearly, Evelyn."

"I understand your reminder," she bit out. "If I promise, will you let me go now?" She spoke fast, afraid that hesitation would give him another opening.

His expression darkened. "Are you afraid I’ll kiss you?"

Evelyn didn’t answer. She didn’t want to answer.

Then—his phone rang.

Her stomach twisted. Isabella. The thought alone made her blood run cold.

Nathaniel pulled away, answering the call. "Mother?"

"Come to the hospital. Now. Edward’s condition has worsened."

"Understood." His voice was grim as he threw off the covers and stood. "Grandfather’s been admitted. We need to go."

Evelyn paled. She scrambled out of bed, her movements frantic as she washed up.

The drive to the hospital was tense, silence thick between them. Evelyn’s mind raced. Edward had always been kind to her—kinder than her own parents, even. The thought of losing him was unbearable.

At a red light, Nathaniel reached for her hand, his grip warm and steady. "He’ll be fine," he murmured.

She nodded, but the knot in her chest refused to loosen.

When they arrived, Edward had already been moved to a private ward, though he remained unconscious.

The doctor’s words were measured. "Mr. Martin is stable, but we don’t know when he’ll wake. This episode was triggered by emotional distress. His heart can’t take any more strain—no agitation, no stress."

Edward’s health had always been fragile—heart disease, hypertension, the usual burdens of age.

Richard waited until the doctor left before speaking. "Nathaniel. A word."

Evelyn’s stomach churned with guilt.

Nathaniel squeezed her hand. "Stay here. I’ll handle this."

She gave a small nod, but how could she not worry?

Seeing Edward like this—pale, motionless, an oxygen mask over his face—was unbearable.

I’m so sorry, Grandfather. This is my fault. All of it.

Tears spilled over before she could stop them.

Victoria was at her side instantly, pressing a tissue into her hand. "Don’t cry, darling. Edward wouldn’t want this. He only ever wanted you and Nathaniel to be happy." She pulled Evelyn into a gentle embrace. "No matter what happens between you two, you’ll always be family."

The words shattered her.

She’d always known the Martins cared for her—perhaps out of loyalty to her grandfather, perhaps out of genuine affection. But this—this was real.

Evelyn sobbed harder.

Victoria held her tighter, stroking her hair. "If you truly want a divorce, I won’t stop you. But think carefully. And know this—even if you leave Nathaniel, we will never let Isabella take your place."

Evelyn stilled. "Why?"

The question hung between them, heavy with unspoken meaning.
###Chapter 20

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She tapped her pen absently against the blueprint, her mind elsewhere. The meeting with Nathaniel last night had left her unsettled, his words replaying in her head like a broken record.

"I need you to trust me, Evelyn."

But trust wasn’t something she gave easily—not after everything.

A sharp knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, stepped in, holding a sleek black envelope. "This just arrived for you," she said, placing it on the desk. "No return address."

Evelyn frowned, picking it up. The paper was thick, expensive. She slid her finger under the seal and pulled out an embossed invitation.

You are cordially invited to the reopening of the Grand Aurora Ballroom.
Hosted by Isabella Davis.

Her stomach twisted. Isabella—Nathaniel’s ex, the woman who had once held his heart. The same woman who had made it clear she wasn’t done with him.

Gabrielle hesitated. "Everything okay?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Fine. Just an event invitation."

But it wasn’t just an event. It was a challenge.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Nathaniel.

Meeting ran late. Dinner tonight?

She stared at the screen, torn between suspicion and the desire to believe him. Was he hiding something? Or was she letting past wounds cloud her judgment?

Before she could reply, another notification popped up—this time from Gregory Wilson, her business partner.

Got a call from Summit Realty. They want to discuss a collaboration. Edward Wilson himself requested you.

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. Summit Realty was a major player, and Edward Wilson wasn’t someone who made personal calls unless it was important.

But why now?

She exhaled sharply, her fingers flying over the keyboard as she replied to Nathaniel.

Can’t make dinner. Work thing.

A lie. But she needed time to think.

Because between Isabella’s sudden reappearance and Edward’s unexpected interest, something didn’t add up.

And Evelyn Mitchell wasn’t one to walk into a storm unprepared.

Evelyn felt the warmth of Victoria's hand as the older woman gave her a knowing smile. "Because you're the only one we want," Victoria said softly.

The words settled heavily in Evelyn's chest. She understood this wasn't just empty reassurance. There was history here—something between the Martins and Isabella that Nathaniel remained oblivious to.

Before she could dwell on it further, Nathaniel and Richard entered the room.

Richard's gaze softened when it landed on Evelyn. "You should head to work, dear. Victoria and I will stay with Edward."

Evelyn hesitated, glancing at Nathaniel for confirmation.

His expression was unreadable. "Go. My parents have everything under control."

Reluctantly, Evelyn nodded. "Alright. We'll come back tonight."

Victoria squeezed her hand. "That's my girl. Now go."

The walk to the parking lot was silent, the weight of unspoken words pressing between them. Once inside the car, Nathaniel finally spoke.

"We need to delay the divorce." His voice was steady. "At least until Edward's condition stabilizes."

Evelyn blinked, caught off guard. "Is that what Richard suggested?"

"Yes. And I agree." He turned to her, his dark eyes searching hers. "Unless you have objections?"

"Of course not," she said quickly. "Edward has been nothing but kind to me. I'd do anything for him." She paused, then added carefully, "But won’t this complicate things with Isabella?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened, that familiar irritation flickering across his features. "Evelyn, how many times must I say it? This has nothing to do with her."

She pressed her lips together, swallowing the bitter taste of disbelief. Nothing to do with her? He was planning to marry the woman. Of course it mattered. But she knew better than to argue. He would never admit that he was shielding Isabella from scrutiny.

The rest of the drive passed in tense silence.

Nathaniel dropped Evelyn off at her office building. As she stepped out, she considered bringing up the alleged design theft—but the words died on her tongue. She didn’t know how to broach the subject without sounding accusatory. Worse, she refused to let him see her as weak.

So she stayed quiet, watching as his car disappeared down the street before turning toward the glass doors of her firm.

Inside, Gregory was already waiting, his expression grim.

"What's wrong?" she asked.

He motioned for her to follow him into her office. Once the door was shut, he exhaled sharply. "Someone posted about plagiarism on Mayby's local forum. Several of our past clients are demanding answers. Summit Realty is threatening legal action if we don’t provide a satisfactory explanation by the end of the day."

If sued, Summit Realty would terminate their contract and demand compensation.

Though these consequences had been outlined before, Summit Realty preferred a private settlement—direct negotiations with the Martin Group. That way, the deal could still be salvaged. Even if it fell through, at least there’d be no lawsuit.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. She pressed her fingers to her temples, thinking. "If other firms want an investigation, cooperate fully. Transparency is key." She met Gregory’s gaze. "Have you looked into our staff?"

Their company was small but elite, its rapid rise in the industry making them a target. Envy bred sabotage. They’d always known this day might come.

Gregory nodded. "We’re working on it. But whoever leaked this is careful. We can’t act recklessly—not without risking panic among the team."
###Chapter 21

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She tapped her pencil absently against the blueprint, her mind elsewhere. The confrontation with Nathaniel last night still weighed heavily on her.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Evelyn?" Gabrielle poked her head in, holding a steaming cup of coffee. "Thought you could use this."

"Thanks." Evelyn accepted the cup, savoring the rich aroma. "Any updates on the Montgomery project?"

Gabrielle hesitated. "Actually, Mr. Wilson wants to see you in his office. He said it's urgent."

Evelyn's stomach tightened. Gregory never summoned her without reason. Setting down her coffee, she smoothed her blouse and headed down the hall.

Gregory's office door stood ajar. Inside, he was pacing behind his desk, his usually composed features drawn tight. When he saw Evelyn, he gestured for her to sit. "We have a problem."

"What kind of problem?" Evelyn perched on the edge of the chair.

"The Martin Group just pulled out of our joint venture." Gregory ran a hand through his hair. "No explanation, just a termination notice."

Evelyn's breath caught. Nathaniel's doing, no doubt. Was this retaliation for last night? She clenched her fists in her lap. "I'll handle it."

"Handle it how?" Gregory's voice rose. "This was our biggest contract, Evelyn. Without it—"

"I said I'll handle it." Evelyn stood abruptly. "Give me twenty-four hours."

Outside, the midday sun glared down mercilessly. Evelyn barely noticed as she hailed a cab. "Martin Group headquarters," she told the driver. Her phone buzzed—a text from Charlotte: Heard what happened. You okay?

Evelyn typed a quick reply: Fine. Handling it.

The sleek glass tower of Martin Group loomed ahead. Evelyn marched through the revolving doors, ignoring the curious glances from the reception staff. "I need to see Nathaniel Martin. Now."

The receptionist blinked. "Do you have an appointment?"

"No." Evelyn leaned forward, her voice low. "Tell him Evelyn Mitchell is here. He'll see me."

Moments later, the elevator doors opened on the executive floor. Samuel Yates waited, his expression unreadable. "Mr. Martin is in a meeting."

Evelyn brushed past him. "Then I'll wait."

Nathaniel's office was empty, the large windows offering a panoramic view of the city. Evelyn paced, her heels clicking against the polished floor. The door opened, and Nathaniel stepped in, his tailored suit immaculate as always.

His gaze locked onto hers. "I was wondering how long it would take you to come."

"Cut the games, Nathaniel." Evelyn crossed her arms. "Why did you terminate our contract?"

Nathaniel moved to his desk, pouring himself a drink. "Business decision."

"Bullshit." Evelyn's voice shook. "This is about last night."

Nathaniel took a slow sip of whiskey. "Maybe I just don't trust your firm anymore."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. "You're jeopardizing dozens of jobs over a personal vendetta."

Nathaniel set his glass down with a sharp click. "And what about you, Evelyn? Wasn't keeping secrets from me personal?"

The air between them crackled with tension. Evelyn opened her mouth to retort when Nathaniel's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening. "We'll continue this later."

Evelyn caught his arm as he turned to leave. "No. We finish this now."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "It's Isabella. She's at the hospital."

The blood drained from Evelyn's face. "What happened?"

"I don't know." Nathaniel pulled free. "But I'm going to find out."

As he strode out, Evelyn stood frozen. The pieces clicked into place—Isabella's sudden reappearance, Nathaniel's distance, and now this. She reached for her phone, dialing Caroline. "I need a favor."

"Alright, take care of that. What about the other firm?" Evelyn asked, rubbing her temples.

"I looked into it. Their CEO, Mr. Sinclair, has a terrible reputation in the industry. They've been operating at a loss for years, massive layoffs... Barely surviving," Gregory replied, scrolling through his tablet.

She exhaled sharply.

Gregory hesitated before asking, "Should we confront them head-on?"

"It's useless right now."

But whether it was futile or not, they had to push forward.

An hour later, they meticulously compared the color schemes and uploaded both the plagiarized and original designs to a design forum. A handful of professionals noticed the discrepancies and voiced their support, but the majority dismissed them as trying to deflect blame.

By afternoon, strangers loitered outside the office, harassing employees trying to enter or leave. The situation was escalating dangerously.

Evelyn had no choice—she dialed Donovan Sinclair herself.

When he answered, she didn’t waste time. "Mr. Sinclair, we’re all just trying to make a living. Isn’t this going too far?"

"I have no idea what you’re talking about. Don’t throw around accusations without proof. I could sue you for slander," Donovan snapped.

Evelyn’s pulse pounded in her ears. "Mr. Sinclair, does your company actually have evidence that we stole anything? Accusing us publicly with nothing but a few images? That’s defamation, isn’t it?"

"Listen here, sweetheart. Watch your tone. If your work is legit, you shouldn’t be afraid of a little competition. Disagree? Prove your innocence. Otherwise, apologize and get out of the business—or face the consequences."

The line went dead before she could respond.

Evelyn clenched her fists. He was twisting everything!

She inhaled deeply, forcing down the fury bubbling inside her.

A year ago, she would’ve exploded.

But now, she had to stay composed.

Turning to Gregory, she said, "We might need to close the office for a few days. I don’t want anyone getting hurt."

"I was thinking the same," Gregory agreed. "Emily’s already informing everyone."

Emily was Gregory’s assistant.

Evelyn nodded, exhaustion weighing on her features.

Gregory frowned. "Are you okay? You look pale."

"I’m fine."

"Evelyn, you can talk to me. I’m here for you."

"I know," she murmured.

Just then, Emily rushed in, breathless.

"Mr. Wilson, Ms. Mitchell—there’s trouble outside!"

They hurried out, but Evelyn swayed, nearly stumbling. Gregory caught her arm. "Evelyn, seriously, are you alright?"

"I’m fine. Let’s see what’s happening."

Outside, the company’s entrance was vandalized—"THIEVES" scrawled in red paint across the glass.

Trash littered the ground, reeking of rotten food.

Their office was in a sleek high-rise, surrounded by young professionals. Gossip spread fast, and a crowd had already gathered.

Evelyn’s head throbbed. She turned away, retreating to her office.

Gregory followed, concern etched on his face. "You need rest. Let me take you home. I’ll handle this mess, and I’ll meet Donovan tonight. Maybe we can negotiate a way out."

Evelyn didn’t argue. She felt awful—dizzy, nauseous, her heart racing. Between the stress and worrying about Edward, she needed to rest—not just for herself, but for the baby.

By the time she returned to Pineview Villa, it was evening.

She texted Victoria for an update on Edward. Still unconscious, but stable.

Victoria assured her not to come—Richard would be there that night.

Evelyn didn’t push. She checked the time—Nathaniel wasn’t home yet.

After a long hesitation, she called him.

If it were just her and Gregory, she’d tough it out. But her employees—people who’d trusted her—were suffering. She owed them a solution.

Afraid she’d lose her nerve, she cut straight to the point when he answered.

"Nathaniel, I need your help. My company’s in trouble. Can you step in?"
###Chapter 22

The morning light filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work, his side of the bed cold. She sighed, stretching before reaching for her phone. A message from Gregory flashed on the screen: "Meeting at 10. Don’t be late."

She groaned, rubbing her temples. The pressure of the upcoming project weighed heavily on her. The Martin Group’s latest venture was high-profile, and every detail had to be flawless. Evelyn couldn’t afford any mistakes—not with Nathaniel’s family scrutinizing her every move.

Downstairs, Alfred had prepared her usual breakfast: a cup of strong black coffee and a slice of avocado toast. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted with a polite nod. "Mr. Martin left early. He mentioned a board meeting."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Thank you, Alfred." She took a sip of coffee, the bitterness grounding her. The silence of the house was deafening. Even with the staff bustling about, it felt hollow without Nathaniel’s presence.

Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was Caroline. "Emergency brunch. Café Blanc. 30 minutes." Evelyn frowned. Caroline wasn’t one for dramatics, so whatever it was had to be serious.

She arrived at the café to find Caroline already seated, her expression unreadable. "What’s going on?" Evelyn asked, sliding into the chair opposite her.

Caroline pushed a tabloid across the table. The headline screamed: "Martin Heir’s Secret Reunion with Ex-Lover!" Beneath it was a grainy photo of Nathaniel and Isabella, their heads close together in what looked like an intimate conversation.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. "This is nonsense," she muttered, though her voice lacked conviction.

"Is it?" Caroline arched a brow. "Because according to my sources, they’ve been meeting regularly."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the paper. She had trusted Nathaniel implicitly, but doubt crept in like a shadow. "I need to talk to him."

"Be careful," Caroline warned. "The Martins play dirty. Don’t let them break you."

Back at the office, Evelyn’s mind raced. She barely registered Gregory’s updates during their meeting. All she could think about was Nathaniel and Isabella. Had he lied to her? Was their marriage just another business arrangement to him?

That evening, she waited in their bedroom, the tabloid clutched in her hand. When Nathaniel finally walked in, his tie loosened and exhaustion lining his face, she held it up. "Care to explain?"

His eyes flickered to the photo, then back to her. "It’s not what it looks like."

"Then what is it?" Her voice trembled.

Nathaniel ran a hand through his hair. "Isabella’s in trouble. She needed help, and I couldn’t turn her away."

Evelyn scoffed. "How convenient. And you didn’t think to tell me?"

"I didn’t want to worry you." He reached for her, but she stepped back.

"Worry me? Or did you think I’d stop you from seeing her?" The words tasted bitter on her tongue.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "This isn’t about her. It’s about trust. Do you trust me or not?"

Evelyn hesitated. The man standing before her was the same one who had vowed to love her, yet the doubt gnawed at her heart. "I don’t know," she whispered.

The hurt in his eyes was unmistakable. "Then we have bigger problems than Isabella."

The tension between them was suffocating. Evelyn turned away, her chest aching. Had their love been a lie all along? Or was she letting her insecurities destroy everything?

As Nathaniel left the room, the door clicking shut behind him, Evelyn sank onto the bed, the weight of her doubts crushing her. The battle lines had been drawn, and she wasn’t sure which side she was on anymore.

"Isabella? Oh, it's Evelyn." The soft voice on the other end of the line made Evelyn freeze mid-step.

She gripped her phone tighter before responding coolly, "Why do you have Nathaniel's phone?"

"He asked me to hold it while he's freshening up," Isabella's melodic voice replied. "You could call back later... or better yet, why don't you join us? We're at Vera Wang selecting my wedding gown. Your professional opinion would be invaluable - you are an artist with spaces, after all."

The words "wedding gown" struck Evelyn like a physical blow. Her breath hitched as icy realization crept through her veins. "Did you say... wedding dress shopping?" she repeated, her voice unnaturally steady.

"Mm-hmm," Isabella practically purred. "Nathaniel says I'm recovering beautifully. Once your divorce is finalized, we won't have to wait. We're doing everything in advance - gown, venue, even the photoshoot. You don't mind, do you Evelyn? It's not like you ever truly wanted him."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palm. "Why would I mind? I'm absolutely thrilled for you both." Her tone could have frozen hell. "So this was all Nathaniel's idea?"

"Oh yes," Isabella gushed. "He's so considerate - always putting my needs first, making sure I'm comfortable."

A bitter taste filled Evelyn's mouth. "How lovely. I won't keep you then."

"Aren't you coming to help?" Isabella's faux-innocent question hung in the air.

Evelyn ended the call without answering.

She stared at her reflection in the darkened window - an architect, not a bridal consultant. What was she supposed to do? Critique the cathedral-length train? Suggest better floral arrangements for their future home?

The irony burned. While Evelyn had never known such romantic gestures from Nathaniel, Isabella - who'd slept through a year of her life - now basked in his undivided devotion.

Nathaniel's hypocrisy was staggering. Just this morning he'd insisted on delaying their divorce for his grandfather's sake. Yet here he was, playing devoted fiancé to another woman. Did he think her a complete fool?

Her hand drifted to her still-flat abdomen. "I'm so sorry, little one," she whispered. "I can't give you the perfect family. But I swear on my life, you'll never lack for love."

Assuming Nathaniel wouldn't return that night, Evelyn ate a solitary dinner, showered, and crawled into bed.

She'd nearly drifted off when light flooded the room. Blinking awake, she found Nathaniel looming over her, his expression unreadable.

"What are you doing here?" The words slipped out before she could stop them.

His brows knitted together. "This is my house. Where else would I be?"

"With Isabella, presumably. I assumed you'd be... occupied."

"Evelyn," he sighed, running a hand through his hair, "why must you constantly pick fights about Isabella? It's becoming tiresome."

The accusation ignited the fury she'd suppressed all evening. Bolting upright, she met his gaze head-on.

"So now I'm the unreasonable one?" Her voice trembled with barely-contained rage. "You really can't fathom why I might be upset?"

The air between them crackled with unspoken accusations, the gulf between them widening by the second.
###Chapter 23

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She traced the strong line of his jaw with her fingertips, marveling at how peaceful he looked.

A vibration from her phone interrupted the quiet moment. It was Gregory. "Emergency meeting at the office. Need you here ASAP."

Evelyn sighed. She had hoped for a lazy Sunday with Nathaniel, but duty called. Slipping out of bed, she dressed quickly in a tailored blazer and slacks, her mind already racing through potential crises at the firm.

Downstairs, Alfred had prepared her usual espresso. "You're leaving early, Miss Evelyn," he observed.

"Work never sleeps, Alfred," she replied, taking the cup gratefully.

The drive to the office was tense. The city streets were unusually empty for a weekend morning, amplifying her unease. When she arrived, Gregory was pacing in the conference room, his expression grim.

"We lost the Summit Realty project," he announced without preamble.

Evelyn froze. "What? How?"

"Sebastian Wilson pulled the plug. Claims our designs didn’t meet their ‘vision.’" Gregory scoffed. "Bullshit. Someone got to him."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. That project was their biggest yet—a chance to prove her firm could compete with the industry giants. Losing it now would be catastrophic.

Just then, her phone buzzed again. An unknown number.

"Meet me at The Velvet Lounge. Noon. Alone. -VD"

Vanessa Davis. Isabella’s agent.

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. What could she possibly want?

Gregory noticed her distraction. "Everything okay?"

She forced a smile. "Fine. Just need to handle something personal."

As she left the office, Evelyn’s mind raced. Was this about Nathaniel? About her?

The Velvet Lounge was dimly lit, the air thick with the scent of bourbon and expensive perfume. Vanessa sat in a corner booth, her crimson nails tapping impatiently against her glass.

"You’re late," she remarked as Evelyn approached.

"Traffic," Evelyn lied, sliding into the seat opposite her.

Vanessa smirked. "Cut the crap. I know you’re wondering why I called." She leaned forward. "Isabella’s back in town. And she’s not here to play nice."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her clutch. "What does that have to do with me?"

Vanessa’s smile turned predatory. "Everything, sweetheart. Because she’s coming for your husband."

The words hit like a physical blow. Evelyn’s breath caught, but she refused to show weakness. "Nathaniel and I are solid."

"Are you?" Vanessa chuckled. "Then why did he visit her hotel last night?"

The room spun. Evelyn’s carefully constructed composure cracked.

Vanessa slid a photo across the table—Nathaniel, standing outside a luxury hotel, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn’s heart shattered.

But before she could respond, her phone rang. Nathaniel’s name flashed on the screen.

Vanessa’s grin widened. "Speak of the devil."

Evelyn hesitated. Then, with trembling fingers, she answered.

"Evelyn," Nathaniel’s voice was urgent. "We need to talk. Now."

"What exactly should I understand?" Nathaniel asked, his brows knitting together in confusion.

Evelyn pressed her lips into a thin line before speaking bluntly, "Where were you tonight? You promised you'd come home early. We were supposed to visit Grandfather together."

"Something urgent came up. I already informed Mother."

"Did you inform me?"

His frown deepened. Something was off about Evelyn tonight—her tone was sharper, more accusatory. This wasn’t the composed woman he knew. The change unsettled him.

"If you’re upset because I didn’t tell you, then I apologize. It won’t happen again. Is that what you want to hear?"

Silence stretched between them.

Nathaniel exhaled, his voice low and measured. "If there’s something else bothering you, say it now."

"It’s not about being bothered. It’s about how long you plan to keep lying to me."

"Lying?" His jaw tightened. "What are you talking about?"

Evelyn felt a surge of frustration. Why wouldn’t he just admit it?

"Nathaniel, there’s no point hiding things now. We’re getting divorced anyway. Just be honest with me. If you were out picking a wedding dress with Isabella to prepare for your new life together, you could’ve told me. At least then I wouldn’t have felt like an idiot calling and interrupting your little date."

They were married, yet they didn’t even have a single photo together.

Apart from a legal document and the nights they’d shared, there was no proof they had ever been a couple.

The realization twisted like a knife in her chest.

She didn’t regret loving him, but loving him had become her greatest punishment.

Evelyn quickly lowered her gaze, refusing to let him see the tears threatening to spill. She wouldn’t give him the satisfaction of witnessing her weakness.

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened with disbelief. "Wedding dress? Evelyn, what the hell are you talking about?"

"Just admit it."

"Why would I admit to something I didn’t do? This isn’t like you. Where is this paranoia coming from?"

He tugged at his tie, frustration evident in the sharp lines of his face. His entire demeanor radiated icy detachment.

Nathaniel studied her, his voice dangerously controlled. "Are you fabricating this just to force the divorce?"

Evelyn lifted her chin, defiance flashing in her eyes. "Isabella told me you were choosing a wedding dress, Nathaniel. If you’re worried I’ll expose you in front of your family, don’t be. I’m not that petty."

She had loved him with everything she had. Now, his insistence on ending their marriage only proved how little she meant to him.

She wouldn’t let him see her break. Not again.

Nathaniel’s expression hardened. "You misunderstood. I was helping her pick out clothes because she was being discharged today. And she borrowed my phone to call her former agent. That’s all."

"So now I’m accusing her for no reason? And lying about you two?"

"I didn’t say that."

"But that’s what you’re implying, isn’t it? I don’t understand why your phone is always with Isabella whenever I call. If you don’t want to answer, fine. I won’t call anymore."

Her voice wavered, barely holding back the tremor of emotion. Her fingers clenched into fists beneath the sheets, nails digging into her palms to keep herself from shattering.

Nathaniel’s gaze turned piercing, his tone cutting. "Evelyn, are you deliberately picking a fight?"
###Chapter 24

The morning sun cast a golden glow over the city as Evelyn stepped into the sleek glass building of Martin Group. Her heels clicked against the polished marble floor, echoing through the vast lobby. She clutched her portfolio tighter, her mind racing with the presentation she was about to give.

Nathaniel had insisted she take the lead on the new luxury resort project—his way of proving her capabilities to the board. But the weight of his expectations pressed heavily on her shoulders.

As she entered the conference room, the murmurs of the executives quieted. All eyes turned to her.

"Good morning," she greeted, forcing a confident smile.

Samuel Yates, Nathaniel’s ever-efficient secretary, handed her the remote for the projector. "Everything is set up, Mrs. Martin."

She nodded her thanks and began. "The design integrates sustainable materials while maintaining the elegance expected from a Martin Group property."

Her voice was steady, but her pulse betrayed her. She could feel Nathaniel’s gaze from the head of the table—intense, unwavering.

Halfway through, the door swung open.

Isabella Davis strode in, her crimson dress commanding attention. "Apologies for the interruption," she said smoothly, though her smirk suggested otherwise.

Evelyn’s grip on the remote tightened.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "This is a private meeting, Isabella."

"I know," she purred, sliding into an empty seat. "But since I’m now a stakeholder in this project, courtesy of my father’s recent investment, I thought I should familiarize myself with the details."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. She hadn’t been warned.

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched. "We’ll discuss this later."

Isabella merely smiled, crossing her legs. "By all means, continue, Evelyn. I’m eager to see what you’ve come up with."

The air thickened with tension. Evelyn inhaled sharply, then resumed, her voice firmer now. She wouldn’t let Isabella rattle her.

But as she clicked to the next slide, the screen flickered—then went black.

A beat of silence.

Then, laughter.

Isabella’s.

Evelyn’s cheeks burned. She shot a glance at Samuel, who was already rushing to fix the issue.

Nathaniel stood abruptly. "Enough. We’ll reconvene in an hour."

As the executives filed out, murmuring among themselves, Evelyn remained rooted in place.

Isabella lingered, leaning in close. "You really think you belong here?" she whispered. "This world isn’t for outsiders, darling."

Evelyn met her gaze, fire in her eyes. "We’ll see about that."

Isabella’s smile faltered—just for a second—before she sauntered out.

Nathaniel approached, his voice low. "I didn’t know she’d be here."

Evelyn exhaled. "It’s fine."

But it wasn’t.

And they both knew it.

The icy glare in Nathaniel's eyes sent a sharp pang through Evelyn's chest, as if it had struck directly at her heart.

She stood frozen, words failing her.

Their gazes remained locked in a silent battle until, at last, he turned and strode out of the bedroom.

The air between them thickened with tension, pushing them further apart.

He had dismissed every accusation Isabella made.

Was Isabella lying? Evelyn wondered.

Her lips pressed into a thin line, her heart weighed down by unspoken doubts.

The night passed in heavy silence. Nathaniel never returned to their room, yet he hadn’t left the house either. No engine roared to life, no tires crunched over gravel.

Neither would yield. By morning, when Evelyn descended the stairs, Nathaniel was already gone—off to Martin Group before dawn.

In the car, Samuel stole several glances at Nathaniel through the rearview mirror, hesitating.

Finally, Nathaniel noticed.

"What is it?" he asked coolly.

Samuel cleared his throat. "Mr. Martin, there’s trouble at Mrs. Martin’s firm. Negative press has flooded their social media. It’s serious—if not handled, it could destroy the company."

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed slightly. "Hmm."

Samuel relayed every detail before cautiously adding, "Should I reach out to Summit Realty?"

Nathaniel said nothing, his jaw tight.

He remembered Evelyn’s call yesterday. Had she been trying to tell him about this?

The image of her distressed expression lingered, an uncomfortable weight settling in his chest.

"Turn the car around," he ordered quietly. "We’re going to Summit Realty."

Samuel obeyed immediately, swerving the vehicle toward the towering skyscraper.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had just arrived at her office, her phone buzzing incessantly with calls from Gregory. She ignored them, her mood too somber for a conversation she knew would only deepen her frustration.

Gregory intercepted her the moment she stepped into the lobby, his sharp gaze scrutinizing her. "Evelyn, did you speak to Nathaniel about the Summit Realty issue?"

The memory of last night’s argument flashed in her mind. She forced a smile and shook her head. "No. And I won’t. We’ll handle this ourselves first. Worst case, we still have options."

Gregory’s expression hardened almost imperceptibly. "Summit just called. They apologized. The deal is back on. Yohan’s agency is under investigation for defamation."

Evelyn blinked in disbelief. "Summit said that?"

"Yes. I called you immediately."

"Did they mention anything else?"

Gregory shook his head.

Evelyn’s shock mirrored his.

She hadn’t breathed a word to Nathaniel. Could he have—?

No. He wouldn’t. Not with Isabella consuming his attention.

"Since it’s resolved, let’s proceed," she said evenly.

Gregory studied her. "You’re sure you didn’t ask him?"

"Positive."

He exhaled. "I didn’t mean to pry. I just don’t want you compromising yourself."

Her smile was faint. "I know. It’s fine."

Back in her office, Evelyn’s thoughts churned. Who had intervened? The idea of Nathaniel being responsible seemed impossible.

Then her phone rang.

Nathaniel’s name flashed on the screen.

Her fingers tightened around the device before she answered. His voice, deep and steady, filled her ear.

"Evelyn, why didn’t you tell me about the trouble at your firm? I’ve told you—come to me for anything. Has Summit contacted you yet?"

Her breath hitched.

It had been him.

A conflicted ache spread through her chest. Part of her had hoped it was him. Another part wished it weren’t.

Still, gratitude won out. "Thank you, Nathaniel."

"We’re married," he said softly. "No thanks needed."

The word married now felt like a ticking clock.

Her hand pressed against her chest, the pain so sharp it stole her breath.

His voice gentled further. "I didn’t lie to you last night. I wasn’t hiding anything. I was just helping Isabella shop. You know you can trust me, don’t you?"

###Chapter 25

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She rubbed her temples, trying to focus on the blueprints in front of her, but her mind kept drifting back to last night’s argument with Nathaniel.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Evelyn?" Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in, holding a steaming cup of coffee. "Thought you might need this."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Thanks, Gabrielle. You're a lifesaver."

Gabrielle hesitated. "Gregory wants to see you in his office. He said it's urgent."

Evelyn's stomach tightened. Urgent? She hadn’t spoken to Gregory since their last heated discussion about the Summit Realty project.

Down the hall, Gregory’s door was slightly ajar. She knocked once before pushing it open.

He looked up from his desk, his expression unreadable. "Close the door."

Evelyn did as instructed, her pulse quickening.

Gregory leaned back in his chair. "Sebastian Wilson just called. He’s pulling Summit Realty’s funding."

Her breath hitched. "What? Why?"

"Because," Gregory said slowly, "he claims we’ve been withholding critical design changes from him. Changes that, apparently, Nathaniel approved without consulting us."

Evelyn’s hands clenched into fists. "That’s not possible. Nathaniel wouldn’t—"

"Wouldn’t he?" Gregory cut her off. "After everything that’s happened between you two?"

She swallowed hard. The tension between her and Nathaniel had been escalating for weeks, but she never imagined it would bleed into their professional lives.

"I’ll talk to him," she said firmly.

Gregory sighed. "Evelyn, this isn’t just about your marriage. If we lose this client, the firm is at risk."

The weight of his words settled heavily on her shoulders.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Nathaniel.

We need to talk. Tonight. Alone.

Evelyn’s fingers trembled as she typed a reply. I’ll be there.

But as she left Gregory’s office, one thought consumed her: What else is Nathaniel hiding?

Meanwhile, across town, Nathaniel sat in his father’s study, staring at the documents Richard had just handed him.

"You’re sure about this?" Nathaniel asked, his voice low.

Richard nodded grimly. "The board is already questioning your leadership. If this gets out, it won’t just be your reputation at stake—it’ll be the entire company."

Nathaniel ran a hand through his hair. "I’ll handle it."

But as he left the study, his phone buzzed—a message from Isabella.

I know everything. Meet me. Or I go public.

His jaw tightened. Not now.

But time was running out.

And secrets, like walls, were beginning to crack.

What was he playing at? Some kind of explanation now? Evelyn thought bitterly.

But they were on the verge of divorce. Why bother with words that could so easily be misconstrued?

She couldn’t fathom what was going through Nathaniel’s mind.

Yet, his gentleness still made her heart waver.

Loving someone for ten years wasn’t a switch she could flip off. Even if she could endure the pain and suppress her feelings, those tender moments still tugged at her.

Evelyn held her breath, tears pricking her eyes, but she refused to let them fall.

She kept her voice steady. "Why are you telling me this?"

Nathaniel chuckled, low and amused. "Why? You’re asking why? If I don’t explain, I’ll be sleeping on the couch tonight, and the staff will laugh at me for having no authority in my own home. So, do you believe me now, Mrs. Martin?"

Perfect. Now it was her fault.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "You walked out. I didn’t push you away."

"Should I have stayed and kept arguing?"

"I never wanted to argue. You were the one who—"

"Enough," Nathaniel cut in, his tone firm. "Let’s just drop it. Can we not revisit this?"

Since he’d shut it down, there was nothing more to say.

Nathaniel added, "How about we visit Grandpa together this afternoon? I’ll pick you up."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Fine."

After hanging up, she stood frozen, whispering to herself, "Nathaniel, what am I supposed to do with you?"

She didn’t understand why he hadn’t changed toward her, even now.

He still didn’t love her. She wished he were cruel—it would make letting go so much easier.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel was at the hospital.

Isabella was being discharged tomorrow, and he was handling the paperwork.

When he returned to her room, her agent was there.

Isabella was a singer—once thriving, thanks to clever marketing and Nathaniel’s influence, known for a few hits. But since the accident, she’d faded from the spotlight. Only her most loyal fans still waited.

The moment she saw him, she brightened. "Nathaniel! Tell me, honestly—should I even try to revive my career now?"

His expression remained unreadable. "We’ll discuss that when you’re fully recovered. Right now, there’s something else I need to ask you."

Sensing his detachment, Isabella quickly dismissed her agent. Once alone, she asked softly, "What’s wrong? Is there… something wrong with my health?"

Her eyes shimmered with worry.

Illness had left her pale and fragile, her tearful gaze designed to evoke pity.

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed. "You answered my phone when Evelyn called last night, didn’t you?"

Isabella hesitated, then realization dawned.

She bit her lip, guilt flashing across her face. "Did Evelyn say something? I’m sorry—I shouldn’t have picked up. I just thought… since she’s practically family—"

"Isabella," Nathaniel interrupted, voice icy. "This isn’t about Evelyn. What did you say to her?"

Her head dipped, tears welling. "I panicked. She’s been with you for a year, and I… I was scared you might start to care for her. It’s my fault. Please don’t be angry."

Nathaniel’s gaze hardened. "Evelyn and I are still married. I thought you understood that. We can’t act like we’re already divorced."

Isabella nodded, promising it wouldn’t happen again.

But Nathaniel was still displeased. "Rest. I have work, but I’ll be back to take you home tomorrow."

As he left, a cold glint flickered in Isabella’s eyes, her jaw tightening.

That evening, Nathaniel picked Evelyn up from work, and they drove to the hospital together.

Edward hadn’t woken yet, but his vitals were stable.

Seeing them, Victoria beamed. "Don’t worry about your grandfather. If you really want to cheer him up, give him a great-grandchild. That would do it."

Evelyn’s smile stiffened.

Nathaniel frowned. "Mom, why bring that up now?"

"Now? You’ve been married a year! I was pregnant with you within two months. If a man can’t get his wife pregnant, people will talk."

The implication hung heavy.

Evelyn kept her head down, wishing the floor would swallow her.

Richard cleared his throat awkwardly.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, fighting the urge to roll his eyes.

Victoria ignored them, turning to Evelyn. "Be honest, dear—is there something wrong with Nathaniel? Is that why you’re not pregnant?"

###Chapter 26

Evelyn was speechless.

She had no idea how to respond.

Pressing her lips together, Evelyn could only cast a helpless glance at Nathaniel. It was as if he had caught her silent plea for help but deliberately chose not to intervene. Instead, he said coolly, "Evelyn, Mom asked you a question. You need to back me up here, or she’ll misunderstand."

His deep gaze settled on her, a flicker of amusement dancing in his eyes.

What is Nathaniel playing at? Evelyn wondered.

Clearly, he was throwing her under the bus.

Flustered, Evelyn replied softly, "Mom, since Grandpa is fine, Nathaniel and I should get going. We planned to catch a movie."

Then, tugging Nathaniel along, she hurried out, Victoria’s voice trailing behind them. "Grandpa would wake up in joy if he knew you two were going on a date."

The moment they were in the car, Evelyn released Nathaniel’s hand.

He turned to study her, his voice low. "What movie are we seeing?"

"That was just an excuse," Evelyn said flatly.

"You always say lying is wrong, don’t you?"

"It was a white lie. Even if Mom finds out, she won’t blame me."

"A white lie?" Nathaniel’s gaze sharpened. "So, what exactly are you implying?"

Evelyn frowned, realizing his insinuation.

"I’m not implying anything. I didn’t say a word. Stop reading into things," she snapped.

"Fine, I won’t overthink it." Nathaniel leaned closer, his tone deceptively light. "Now that we’re alone, tell me—is there something wrong with my health?"

"How would I know? It’s your body."

Evelyn turned away, unwilling to continue the conversation.

But Nathaniel wasn’t letting it go. He grabbed her wrist, forcing her to face him, his eyes boring into hers. "You’re my wife. If you don’t know, who does?"

Her cheeks burned, and she averted her gaze.

What does he mean by that?

Has he and Isabella never actually…?

Evelyn bit her lip, and the action drew Nathaniel’s attention. Images of her breathless murmurs beneath his kisses flooded his mind—her pleading voice, the way she melted against him—making his breath hitch.

Just then, a phone rang, shattering the moment.

It was Evelyn’s.

The caller ID flashed Gregory.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened.

Unaware, Evelyn answered in front of him. "Hello, Gregory."

Her voice was soft, the same gentle tone she once used with him, but now she was all thorns when it came to Nathaniel.

Whatever Gregory said coaxed a faint smile from Evelyn, irritating Nathaniel beyond reason.

Without warning, Nathaniel murmured, "Evelyn, since Mom thinks we’re on a date, why don’t we stay out tonight?"

Evelyn startled, her eyes flying to his.

Gregory’s voice crackled through the phone. "Evelyn, are you with him?"

She confirmed quietly.

Gregory exhaled sharply. "You’re divorcing. Why is he acting like this?"

Evelyn didn’t have an answer.

They were getting divorced, yet Nathaniel behaved as if nothing had changed. To Evelyn, his indifference only proved how little he cared.

The thought twisted her stomach.

Steadying herself, she told Gregory, "Let’s talk tomorrow at the office."

Hanging up, she met Nathaniel’s gaze. "Let’s just go home. A movie isn’t appropriate."

"Why not?"

"It was an excuse. You didn’t have to take it seriously," she muttered.

"Evelyn," Nathaniel’s voice turned accusing, "are you worried Gregory will misunderstand?"

Frowning, she shot back, "Why would you think that? Didn’t you say we shouldn’t involve others?"

Nathaniel didn’t reply. He slammed the accelerator, and the car lurched forward.

Silence choked the air the entire ride.

Evelyn felt wronged. She hadn’t said anything wrong, yet he was the one upset.

Though they weren’t ignoring each other like last night, everyone at Pineview Villa sensed Nathaniel’s foul mood.

Evelyn refused to coddle him. She’d made up her mind—ripping off the band-aid was better. Giving in would only make her weaker.

Thanks to Charlotte’s intervention, Evelyn’s company maintained its partnership with Summit Realty.

Today, the two firms officially signed their agreement. Summit Realty apologized, "Ms. Mitchell, we sincerely regret the misunderstanding. Had we known you were connected to the Martins and such close friends with Mr. Martin, we would’ve avoided this."

Evelyn offered a tight smile.

Her marriage to Nathaniel was a well-kept secret. Yet, Nathaniel had introduced her as merely a good friend.

It shouldn’t sting—but it did.

After resolving the issue, Evelyn lunched with Gregory, who broached a sensitive topic. "Once you and Nathaniel divorce, will you stay in Mayby?"

"No. I’m leaving once it’s finalized. You’ll manage the company—"

"Evelyn," Gregory cut in, "I told you—where you go, I follow. If you want to keep the company, I’ll arrange management. If not, we dissolve it."

"It stays. I won’t cost people their jobs."

Evelyn was adamant. Dissolving the company would betray everyone who relied on it.

"Fine. Is the divorce date set yet?" Gregory watched her. "Once you leave, you’ll be free again."

Evelyn sighed. "Not yet. Grandpa can’t accept it. I won’t hurt him."

Evelyn spent the day at the office, visibly thinner. Lately, she ate little—only bland foods, avoiding anything rich or spicy.

Gregory drove her back to Pineview Villa that evening.

Given her recent lack of focus, driving wasn’t safe.

As the car stopped, Evelyn reached for her seatbelt—

BANG!

A violent impact jolted them forward, then snapped them back. Thankfully, seatbelts spared them injury, but the shock left Evelyn trembling.

Instinctively, her hands flew to her abdomen. Did I scare you, baby?

Gregory noticed. "Evelyn! Are you hurt?"

She inhaled deeply. Shaken, but the baby felt fine.

"I’m okay," she whispered. "Let’s see what happened."

Stepping out, they recognized the black car behind them.

Gregory glanced at Evelyn, who stared unblinkingly at the man slumped over the wheel.

She rushed forward, yanking the door open. "Nathaniel?"

###Chapter 27

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn’s office, casting golden streaks across her drafting table. She exhaled sharply, rubbing her temples as she stared at the blueprint in front of her. The design for the new Martin Group project was due by the end of the week, and every minute counted.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, not looking up.

Gabrielle, her assistant, stepped inside, balancing a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. "Thought you might need this," she said, placing it carefully on the desk.

Evelyn smiled gratefully. "You’re a lifesaver."

Gabrielle hesitated, then added, "Mr. Wilson called earlier. He said he needs to discuss the final adjustments before the client meeting tomorrow."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her pen. Gregory Wilson, her business partner, had been pushing her harder than usual lately. She knew he meant well—the firm’s reputation was on the line—but the pressure was suffocating.

"I’ll call him back later," she said, forcing her voice to stay even.

Gabrielle nodded and turned to leave, but paused at the door. "Oh, and Nathaniel called too. He said he’d be home late tonight. Another board meeting."

Evelyn’s chest tightened. Lately, it felt like Nathaniel was slipping further away, buried under the weight of his family’s empire. She missed the days when they could just be—no expectations, no obligations.

"Thanks," she murmured, picking up her coffee.

As Gabrielle left, Evelyn leaned back in her chair, staring at the ceiling. The silence of the office pressed in on her, amplifying the doubts swirling in her mind.

Was this what she really wanted? The endless deadlines, the sleepless nights, the growing distance between her and Nathaniel?

Her phone buzzed, snapping her out of her thoughts. A message from Caroline, her cousin and closest confidante:

"Dinner tonight? I need to vent. And you look like you could use a drink."

Evelyn chuckled despite herself. Caroline always knew when she was drowning.

"Deal," she typed back. "But only if you promise not to judge me for ordering dessert first."

Caroline’s reply was instant: "Who do you take me for? Dessert is mandatory."

Evelyn set her phone down, a small smile tugging at her lips. Maybe tonight would be exactly what she needed—a break from the chaos, a moment to breathe.

She turned back to her work, determination flickering in her chest. She would finish this design. She would prove herself.

And maybe, just maybe, she’d find a way to bridge the gap between her and Nathaniel before it was too late.

Nathaniel finally stirred. His voice came out rough. "Yeah."

He straightened up, his gaze settling on Evelyn with unexpected softness. "Forgive me. My chest tightened suddenly—couldn't brake in time. You weren’t frightened, were you?"

Evelyn studied him, her expression unreadable. Was it truly just the brakes?
Or something else entirely? The thought flickered before she crushed it. Nathaniel didn’t love her. Jealousy wasn’t in his repertoire.

"I’m fine," she said evenly. "What’s wrong with your heart?"

"Nothing dire. Likely exhaustion catching up. Rest will suffice." His pallor betrayed him.

Evelyn’s fingers twitched toward him before she checked the impulse. "Then you should go inside."

"Assist me?" The request was quiet, his eyes holding a plea that disarmed her.

That look—gentler than she’d ever seen—left her mute.

Gregory materialized beside them. "Need help, Mr. Martin? Evelyn’s hardly equipped for this. Let me."

Their eyes clashed—two storms colliding. If glares could ignite, the air would’ve combusted.

Nathaniel didn’t budge. "Appreciated, Mr. Wilson, but I’ve an aversion to strangers’ hands. My wife will do." His focus returned to Evelyn, deliberate. "You’ll help me. No need to inconvenience your… colleague further."

Something in his tone struck her as performative. Uncharacteristic.

When she hesitated, he pressed, "Gregory’s already driven you home. It’s improper to impose more. As your husband, I should be thanking him for seeing you safely here."

"Fine. I’ll help." She turned to Gregory, voice lowered. "You should head back."

"Right. Call if you need anything. We’ll talk tomorrow at the office."

"Drive safe."

"You as well, Mr. Wilson."

They watched his taillights vanish before Evelyn offered her arm. Even at her height, Nathaniel’s frame dwarfed hers. His hand settled on her shoulder, nearly pulling her into his shadow.

Alfred met them at the door, alarmed. "Good heavens—what happened?"

"Could you call Dr. Harrison?" Evelyn said. "Nathaniel’s having chest pains. Overwork, likely."

"At once—"

"Unnecessary." Nathaniel cut in. "Rest is all I require."

Evelyn guided him to the sofa, insistent. "Heart issues aren’t trivial. Humor me."

"I’ll recover. Stay with me—no one else." His voice dipped, gaze anchoring her. This version of Nathaniel—vulnerable, almost clingy—unnerved her.

It sparked treacherous hope. He wants me close. But hope was a flame too near old wounds.

No doctor came. She helped him upstairs, later bringing broth. Even unwell, he was elegance incarnate—each sip measured, his profile aristocratic.

Memories surfaced. "Remember our first meeting?" she ventured.

"Vividly," he said. "Charles Mitchell paraded you into Martin Manor, offering your hand."

His pallor didn’t diminish his beauty. That day had been fate’s decree—a marriage he’d resented until meeting her.

What he didn’t know: she’d seen him years earlier, a countryside glimpse that branded her heart.

While she’d carried that memory, he’d remained oblivious, his heart forever Isabella’s.

Evelyn smiled bitterly. "Nathaniel… do you regret marrying me?"

His brow furrowed. "Why ask?"

"Without our wedding, you’d be with Isabella now."

"Hypotheticals are pointless. Fate decided this."

"But if you could choose—would you still marry me?"

"Would you?" he countered.

Would I? Two options: never meet him, or—knowing this pain—never wed him.

"Perhaps," she whispered.

"‘Perhaps’?" His eyes flashed. "It’s yes or no."

"And you?"

"I don’t dwell on impossibilities. What is, is."

Exactly. Some doors were better left unopened.

After his broth, she ran a bath. "Rest afterward. If the pain persists, we’re calling Dr. Harrison."

"Agreed."

Yet as she turned to leave, his hand caught hers. "Where are you going?"

"To change. You bathe first." She needed to check on the baby—call Caroline for reassurance.

His grip tightened. "Aren’t you staying to help?"

Evelyn froze.

###Chapter 28

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the penthouse as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She traced the faint scar on his shoulder—a remnant from the accident that had nearly taken him from her. A shiver ran down her spine at the memory.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory: "Emergency meeting at the office. Summit Realty is making moves."

Evelyn frowned. Summit Realty had been circling their latest project like vultures. Sebastian Wilson wasn’t known for playing fair.

She slipped out of bed, careful not to wake Nathaniel. The marble floor was cool beneath her bare feet as she padded to the walk-in closet. Dressing quickly in a tailored navy suit, she twisted her hair into a sleek bun.

Downstairs, Alfred had already prepared her coffee—black, no sugar. "Good morning, Miss Evelyn. Will Mr. Nathaniel be joining you for breakfast?"

"Not today," she said, grabbing her briefcase. "Tell him I’ll call him later."

The city streets were alive with the usual chaos. Evelyn’s mind raced as her driver navigated through traffic. Summit Realty’s sudden aggression didn’t make sense. Unless they had inside information.

Her office was in turmoil when she arrived. Gabrielle, her assistant, rushed over. "Gregory’s in the conference room. Jonathan Blake just left—he was livid."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Jonathan was Sebastian’s right-hand man. Whatever had happened, it was bad.

She pushed open the conference room door. Gregory stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his expression grim. "They’ve undercut our bid for the waterfront property. By millions."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. "That’s impossible. Our numbers were airtight."

"Unless someone leaked them." Gregory’s gaze darkened. "I had Charlotte run a check. There were unauthorized accesses to our server last night."

A cold realization settled over her. The only people with that level of access were her, Gregory, and—

"Nathaniel’s team," she whispered.

Gregory nodded. "Samuel Yates pulled the files at midnight."

Evelyn’s hands clenched. Samuel was Nathaniel’s most trusted secretary. But why would Nathaniel sabotage her?

Her phone rang. An unknown number.

She answered.

"Miss Mitchell," a smooth, familiar voice purred. Isabella Davis. "Did you really think you could keep him?"

The line went dead.

Evelyn’s vision blurred. This wasn’t just business.



The way he phrased it was so gallant, yet Evelyn felt heat creeping up her neck, staining her cheeks a soft rose. Despite their newfound honesty, his blunt request for assistance with bathing was mortifyingly direct.

She yanked her hand back sharply, ducking her head as if that could hide her embarrassment. "You should finish washing up," she muttered. "I'll take this bowl downstairs."

But Nathaniel didn’t release her. Instead, his voice dropped lower, rougher. "Evelyn," he murmured, amusement lacing his tone, "are you flustered?"

Of course she wouldn’t admit it. Lifting her chin, she met his gaze head-on, her expression deliberately composed. "Do you actually need my help?"

"We are married," he countered smoothly. "This is hardly unusual."

"Fine." Without another word, Evelyn turned to face him fully and began undoing the buttons of his shirt. Her nails—short, practical—grazed his skin in fleeting, accidental touches, shifting the air between them from neutral to charged.

Nathaniel stood rigid, unmoving, while Evelyn kept her eyes fixed straight ahead, betraying nothing.

Only when she reached the last button did he finally stop her, his hand closing over hers. "I’ll handle the rest," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "You can go."

Evelyn hesitated for a fraction of a second before withdrawing and stepping out.

She knew Nathaniel’s habits well. Knew exactly how to unsettle him.

Outside the bathroom, she pressed her palms to her flushed cheeks, exhaling sharply before heading downstairs.

She handed the bowl to the maid, then slipped into the garden to make a call.

The moment the line connected, a familiar voice greeted her. "Evelyn? Why are you calling so late?"

"I need to ask you something about the baby..."

After explaining briefly, she added, "Could there be complications?"

"If you're worried, come to the hospital this week. I’ll examine you properly. If you’re keeping it, we’ll need to schedule prenatal screenings."

"Alright. I’ll arrange it discreetly. No one else can know yet."

"Don’t worry. I’ll handle it."

"Thank you."

"Since when are you so formal with me? We’ll talk more in person."

"See you then."

Hanging up, Evelyn deleted the call log before returning upstairs.

Nathaniel had just stepped out of the shower when she handed him a glass of water. "Drink this and rest early tonight. No work, okay?"

He studied her, something unreadable flickering in his gaze.

It felt like the days before the divorce discussion—when she’d fuss over him tirelessly, every detail attended to with quiet devotion.

A thought struck him then, sudden and improbable.

His expression darkened, inscrutable as a buried relic.

Late that night, the bedroom’s silence was shattered by a phone ringing.

Nathaniel’s.

He answered immediately. "Yes?"

"Nathaniel, can you come? Someone just knocked on my door. I’m terrified—what if it’s them? What if they know I’m awake now?"

Isabella’s voice pierced the quiet, sharp with panic.

Evelyn’s eyes snapped open.

Nathaniel was already throwing off the covers. "You’re going to the hospital?" she asked flatly.

He glanced at her but didn’t answer, speaking instead to Isabella. "Your nurse is there. Stay with her."

"Nathaniel, I can’t—I feel like they’re watching me. What if they—"

"Isabella?" The call cut out. His jaw tightened. "She’s in trouble. I have to go."

"Do you?" Evelyn’s voice was ice. "You said your heart was bothering you. Shouldn’t you be resting?"

But he was already dressing. "She might be in danger. I can’t ignore that."

"Really?"

"Yes."

His answer was final.

Evelyn stared at him, her gaze hollow. "Fine. Drive safely."

Without another word, she turned away, pulling the covers over herself.

Her indifference sent an inexplicable chill through him. But he didn’t linger, striding out without another glance.

The moment the door shut, Evelyn’s eyes flew open, her heart submerged in freezing water.

Nathaniel had dismissed his own discomfort for Isabella’s fear. What hope did she have?

She had already lost.

His tenderness wasn’t love—it was obligation. She was still his wife, still bound to the Martins.

Nothing more.

Evelyn repeated it like a mantra, her hand drifting to her stomach. I’m sorry, little one. But I promise—I’ll love you enough for both of us.

The next morning, Evelyn found Nathaniel already at the breakfast table.

Had he returned just for this? She didn’t ask, silently taking her seat.

The spread included oatmeal, eggs, pastries—all of which churned her stomach. She forced down the oatmeal, ready to leave when Nathaniel spoke.

"You’re eating too fast. Have an egg."

"I’m fine."

"Evelyn." His voice was low, probing. "Are you upset?"

She paused. "Why would I be?"

"Then sit. Eat properly. I’ll drive you to work."

He was already plating food for her, even peeling an egg before offering it.

When she didn’t take it, he held it out stubbornly.

After ten silent seconds, she relented.

She nearly gagged swallowing it. Before the meal ended, she bolted to the bathroom, retching violently.

Nathaniel frowned when she returned, pale. "You’ve been unwell lately."

"Just tired." She shrugged. "I’ll rest."

He didn’t press further.

They left for work in silence.

By noon, Evelyn finished early and went to the hospital.

Edward still hadn’t woken.

The doctors insisted he was stable, but two days unconscious was terrifying.

Victoria sighed. "Evelyn, let’s be honest—Edward is afraid you two will divorce. If you and Nathaniel reconcile, he’ll wake up."

Evelyn bit her lip, unable to promise anything.

Noticing her hesitation, Victoria changed the subject. "You haven’t eaten, have you? Let’s have lunch."

"Sure."

"Why don’t you call Nathaniel? He should be free now."

Evelyn had no choice but to dial.

"Nathaniel, your mother wants to have lunch. Can you pick us up?"

"Now? I’m busy. Go ahead without me."

His voice was distant.

Evelyn relayed the message. Victoria sighed but nodded.

Then, just before the call ended—

"Nathaniel, let’s get Italian."

Isabella’s voice, bright and close.

Evelyn hung up before he could respond.

Her face went rigid.

Victoria frowned. "What’s wrong?"
###Chapter 29

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She absentmindedly traced the lines of her latest architectural design while her mind replayed last night's argument with Nathaniel for the hundredth time.

Her phone buzzed violently against the mahogany surface. Gabrielle's name flashed on the screen. "Evelyn, you need to see this," her assistant's voice carried an unusual urgency.

Before Evelyn could respond, her office door burst open. Gregory stormed in, his usually composed features twisted in anger. He slammed a tabloid magazine onto her desk. The headline screamed in bold letters: "MARTIN HEIR'S SECRET AFFAIR - NATHANIEL REKINDLES ROMANCE WITH FORMER FLAME ISABELLA DAVIS"

Evelyn's fingers turned ice-cold as she stared at the grainy photo beneath the headline. There was Nathaniel, his arm wrapped protectively around Isabella's waist as they exited a luxury hotel in the middle of the night. The timestamp showed 2:17 AM - just hours after their explosive fight about trust and boundaries.

"I don't believe this," Evelyn whispered, her throat tightening. But the evidence glared back at her, undeniable in its cruelty.

Gregory's voice cut through her spiraling thoughts. "The entire office is buzzing about it. Clients are calling, asking if this will affect our partnership with Martin Group."

Down the hall, muffled gasps and whispers filtered through the thin walls. Evelyn could practically feel the pitying stares burning through the glass partition of her office.

Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was Nathaniel. Fifteen missed calls. Twenty-three unread messages. The screen flashed with another incoming call as she watched.

Gabrielle appeared at the doorway, her face pale. "Evelyn... there's more. The press just released another photo. From last week."

She handed Evelyn a tablet. The image showed Nathaniel and Isabella locked in an intimate embrace at what appeared to be a private dinner. The date stamp proved it was taken the night Nathaniel had claimed to be at a "business meeting with investors."

The office phone began ringing incessantly. Outside, the murmur of voices grew louder. Evelyn's vision blurred as the weight of betrayal pressed down on her chest.

Then her personal phone lit up with a notification from an unknown number. A video attachment with the caption: "Thought you should see the truth about your husband, Mrs. Martin."

Her finger hovered over the play button, trembling. The air in the room grew thick, suffocating. Somewhere in the building, a glass shattered. The world seemed to hold its breath as Evelyn faced the moment that would change everything.

From the corner of her eye, she noticed movement outside her window. Press vans were pulling up in front of their building, cameras already trained on her office. The scandal had arrived at her doorstep, and there would be no escaping it now.

Evelyn shook her head, her voice quiet. "Victoria, let's go eat. He's occupied."

A shadow of detachment flickered in her gaze.

Nathaniel wouldn't join her for lunch. His heart belonged to Isabella now.

She meant nothing to him.

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh, the weight of her insignificance pressing down on her.

A man's indifference could be so absolute.

She didn’t even need to try.

Victoria had chosen the restaurant—an elegant, long-standing establishment in Mayby, not far from the hospital.

They settled into a private booth, ordering three dishes and a soup.

It was their first meal alone together, yet there was no awkwardness. Victoria had a way of putting people at ease, her warmth making conversation effortless.

She leaned in slightly. "How’s work been? If you need anything, don’t hesitate to ask Nathaniel. Or if you’d rather not speak to him, Richard and I are here for you."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Thank you, Victoria. Things are manageable. Nathaniel actually helped me with something recently."

"Did he?" Victoria’s brows lifted in surprise. When Evelyn nodded, she chuckled. "Well, perhaps there’s still hope for him yet."

Evelyn blinked, momentarily caught off guard, while Victoria simply sipped her tea, amused.

The food arrived, and the two fell into easy conversation, the atmosphere light and comfortable.

An hour passed before they playfully argued over the bill, but Evelyn won in the end.

"Victoria, as the younger one, it’s only right I treat you," she insisted. "Besides, this gives me motivation to keep earning."

What she didn’t say was that this might be the last time she could do so. Victoria had been nothing but kind to her—gentle, even—and Evelyn wanted to show her gratitude in her own small way.

Victoria laughed, relenting. "Fine, if my daughter-in-law insists, who am I to refuse? But you’ll have to take me out more often. A mother-in-law should have her perks."

Evelyn only smiled, not responding. She wasn’t sure there would be another time.

After paying, Evelyn linked arms with Victoria as they stepped out—only to freeze at the sound of a sweet, melodic voice behind them.

"Nathaniel, you remembered my favorite dish. You’re too sweet."

Both women turned, their gazes landing not just on the speaker but on the man beside her.

The four of them had collided in the most unfortunate way.

Evelyn’s expression went blank, her emotions locked away behind a carefully constructed wall.

Nathaniel’s surprise was fleeting, quickly replaced by composure. "Mother, what are you and Evelyn doing here?"

Victoria’s eyes narrowed. "What, you’ve reserved the entire place? Are we not allowed?"

"Mrs. Martin," Isabella murmured, her voice soft and deferential. "It’s been so long. I meant to visit, but Nathaniel was concerned about my health. Please don’t be upset with me."

Her head was bowed, her tone dripping with humility.

Victoria, however, showed no mercy. "There’s no need for you to visit Martin Manor. Not everyone is welcome there. By the way, Ms. Davis, are you aware that the man beside you is married?"

Isabella’s breath hitched. She glanced helplessly at Nathaniel.

But Victoria wasn’t done.

"Is there something you can’t say, Ms. Davis? Or do you know he’s married and still cling to him? If so, that’s rather shameless, don’t you think? Given your reputation, it would be quite the scandal."

Isabella’s lips trembled. She clutched Nathaniel’s sleeve. "Nathaniel, Mrs. Martin is right. It’s my fault—"

"Mother," Nathaniel cut in, his voice tight. "Can we discuss this at home? Isabella isn’t fully recovered. She shouldn’t be upset."

"What exactly did I say that was wrong?" Victoria snapped, pulling Evelyn closer. "Tell me, Nathaniel—who is Evelyn to you?"

Evelyn stiffened, caught off guard.

Victoria was never one to mince words.

Evelyn met Nathaniel’s gaze—cool, unreadable. But beneath that calm, she thought she saw accusation.

He blames me for this.

For being here.

For making Isabella feel slighted.

Neither spoke, and Victoria pressed on. "Nathaniel, don’t forget—Edward is still in the hospital. If you dare mistreat Evelyn, don’t bother coming home."

Nathaniel knew better than to argue with his mother. Beneath her gentle exterior lay a spine of steel.

"So?" Victoria demanded. "Who is Evelyn to you?"

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. Silence stretched between them.

Isabella bit her lip. "Mrs. Martin, please don’t pressure Nathaniel. If you’re upset because of me, I’ll apologize—"

"Ms. Davis," Victoria interrupted coldly, "I’m speaking to my son. As an outsider, you should refrain from interrupting."

Isabella’s face paled.

Victoria turned back to Nathaniel. "Well?"

"Evelyn is my wife," Nathaniel said flatly. "Are you satisfied now?"

The words struck like a blow—shocking Evelyn, wounding Isabella, and delighting Victoria.

Victoria smirked at Isabella. "You heard him, didn’t you? A woman with self-respect knows her place. Anything else would be disgraceful."

Isabella’s eyes welled with tears. "Y-You’re right, Mrs. Martin."

"Good. Then we’re done here." Victoria’s gaze swept over her dismissively before landing on Nathaniel. "Now, take Evelyn and me home."

Nathaniel didn’t move. "Mother, you go ahead. Isabella isn’t well—I need to take her back to the hospital."

"Ms. Davis won’t mind," Victoria said sweetly. "She wouldn’t dream of clinging to a married man. Right, Ms. Davis?"

Isabella’s voice was barely a whisper. "Mrs. Martin is right, Nathaniel. You should go with them."

But her eyes pleaded with him, brimming with silent desperation.

Before Nathaniel could respond, Isabella suddenly swayed, her legs giving way. Nathaniel caught her effortlessly, pulling her against his chest.

Evelyn’s breath caught.

Victoria’s eyes flashed with fury.

Evelyn hadn’t expected such a blatant display—right in front of her. The pain in her chest was sharp, suffocating.

Her voice was eerily calm. "Victoria, let’s go."

Without another word, she turned and walked away.

Victoria shot Nathaniel one last scathing look. "You’re a disgrace."

Then she hurried after Evelyn.

Nathaniel’s gaze followed Evelyn’s retreating figure, his expression unreadable.

Isabella, still in his arms, whispered, "Nathaniel… is Evelyn angry?"
###Chapter 30

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew over the blueprints, making precise adjustments with her mechanical pencil. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint aroma of ink from the printer.

A sharp knock interrupted her concentration. "Come in," she called without looking up.

Gabrielle, her assistant, stepped inside with a tablet in hand. "Evelyn, Mr. Wilson is here to see you. He says it's urgent."

Evelyn sighed, setting down her pencil. "Send him in."

Gregory Wilson strode into the room, his usual composed demeanor replaced by visible tension. His tailored suit couldn't hide the stiffness in his shoulders. "We have a problem," he said without preamble.

Evelyn's stomach tightened. "What kind of problem?"

"The Summit Realty project. Sebastian Wilson just pulled the plug. He's citing 'creative differences.'"

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists. "That's bullshit. We've been working on this for months. What's the real reason?"

Gregory hesitated, then lowered his voice. "Rumor has it Isabella Davis paid him a visit last night."

Evelyn's blood ran cold. Isabella—Nathaniel's ex, the woman who'd made it her mission to destroy Evelyn's career since their engagement was announced. "Of course she did," Evelyn muttered, pushing back from her desk. "I need to see the contract."

As Gregory pulled up the documents on his tablet, Evelyn's phone buzzed. A text from Nathaniel: Meeting ran late. Dinner at 8? I'll make reservations.

She typed a quick reply, her mind already racing ahead. This wasn't just about a lost project—it was another move in Isabella's calculated game. And Evelyn refused to play the victim.

"Get me Jonathan Blake's number," she told Gregory. "If Sebastian won't work with us, maybe his project manager will have more sense."

Gregory raised an eyebrow. "You're going behind Wilson's back?"

Evelyn smiled, the determined glint returning to her eyes. "No. I'm finding another way in. Isabella wants a fight? She's about to get one."

The intercom buzzed again. Gabrielle's voice came through: "Evelyn, your mother is on line one. She says it's important."

Evelyn exchanged a glance with Gregory. "Tell her I'll call back in ten minutes." She turned to her partner. "First, we salvage this project. Then I'll deal with family drama."

As Gregory began dialing, Evelyn stared at the city skyline beyond her window. The glittering towers of Martin Group headquarters stood tall in the distance. Somewhere in that building, Nathaniel was working, unaware of the storm brewing around them. She'd protect what was hers—both her career and her marriage.

Even if it meant getting her hands dirty.

Nathaniel remained silent, his features hardening into an unreadable mask.

He tilted his head slightly, eyes narrowing to slits as he stated flatly, "Isabella, I'm taking you back to the hospital now."

"Are you upset with me?" Isabella pressed, fingers twisting in her lap. "Tell me honestly - is it because Evelyn's anger affects you? I deserve to know. After everything that's happened this past year of your marriage... if you've developed feelings for her, just say so. I'll walk away. I won't make this difficult for you."

Her voice trembled with barely restrained emotion as she searched his face for answers.

Nathaniel's expression remained impassive, his tone deceptively light. "What exactly are you afraid of, Isabella? I've already promised to divorce her and marry you. Unless..." A dangerous edge crept into his voice. "Unless you'd prefer I fall for Evelyn and cut you off completely? Would that make you happy?"

"No!" Isabella's hands shot out to grasp his forearm desperately. "That's not what I want at all. I just... I need reassurance. Nathaniel, please finalize the divorce quickly. This uncertainty is tearing me apart..."

"Have some self-respect."

Nathaniel studied the woman before him - once so vibrant and confident, now reduced to this insecure shadow of herself. The transformation unsettled him more than he cared to admit.

Meanwhile, in the hospital parking lot...

Evelyn helped Victoria into the car, her movements precise despite the tension in her shoulders.

"I'm so sorry about Nathaniel's behavior," Victoria murmured, genuine remorse in her eyes. "Tonight, I'll make sure he comes to Martin Manor. Richard and I will set him straight. Please, if there's anything you need to get off your chest..."

Evelyn offered a faint smile that didn't reach her eyes. "Don't trouble yourself, Victoria. I'm perfectly fine. Let's get you back to the hospital."

As they arrived, Evelyn hesitated before speaking. "I won't come up. Please update me immediately if there are any changes with Edward's condition."

"Of course, dear. Drive safely," Victoria replied, concern etching lines around her eyes.

Evelyn's farewell was abruptly cut short as a wave of nausea hit. She turned pale, swallowing hard against the bile rising in her throat.

Victoria froze. "Evelyn? Are you ill?"

"Just... stomach issues. Already saw a doctor. Nothing to worry about," Evelyn lied smoothly, avoiding direct eye contact.

After watching Victoria enter the hospital, Evelyn exhaled shakily, relieved her secret remained safe for now.

Back in Edward's hospital suite, Victoria threw her purse onto a chair with uncharacteristic force. "Your son has gone completely off the rails! No wonder Evelyn wants a divorce."

Richard handed her a glass of water, his calm demeanor belying the storm in his eyes. "Explain everything."

When Victoria finished recounting the restaurant incident, Richard's face darkened. "He's forgotten his place. Summon him to the manor tonight."

Victoria dialed Nathaniel's number while muttering, "I swear we must have brought home the wrong baby from the hospital."

"Don't be absurd," Richard chided, though his frown deepened.

The call connected.

"Nathaniel Martin," Richard's voice brooked no argument, "you will present yourself at Martin Manor tonight. And believe me, you'll regret it if you don't."

"Father, I—"

"Enough!" Richard cut him off. "Have you forgotten who you are? Your actions reflect on this family, on Martin Group, and most shamefully, on your grandfather's legacy."

Through gritted teeth, Nathaniel replied, "Mother's exaggerating. I've done nothing wrong."

"Shall I personally investigate this woman you're seeing?" Richard threatened.

A heavy pause. "...I'll be there."

The line went dead before Nathaniel could say more. He ran a hand through his hair, frustration evident in every tense line of his body.

Isabella watched him carefully. "Trouble?"

"Nothing concerning you."

"Is it because of me? Are your parents angry?"

Nathaniel's response was curt. "Stop imagining problems."

Back at her hospital room, Isabella's anxiety grew as Nathaniel departed. Vanessa arched an eyebrow. "Since when do you let him dictate terms? You used to have him wrapped around your finger."

Isabella's laugh held no humor. "A year apart changes things. He's willing to leave Evelyn for me - I can't risk pushing too hard now."

Vanessa smirked. "Men respond to confidence. Remind him what he's missing."

A calculating gleam entered Isabella's eyes as she considered this.

That evening at Martin Manor...

Nathaniel endured the lecture stonily as Richard pointed an accusing finger. "Charles Mitchell saved this family! Without him, neither of us would be here. We owe Evelyn everything, and this is how you repay her?"

The familiar refrain grated on Nathaniel's nerves. "Understood."

"If you truly understood, you'd cut ties with Isabella immediately. Your grandfather still hasn't woken up. Do you really want to live with that regret?"

Leaving the manor, Nathaniel's grip on the steering wheel turned his knuckles white. Richard's words echoed relentlessly: "Do you really want to live with that regret?"

By 7 PM, he arrived at Pineview Villa.

Alfred greeted him in the foyer. "Master Nathaniel, you're just in time for dinner. Miss Evelyn is dining now—"

Nathaniel brushed past without responding, striding directly to the dining room where Evelyn sat, methodically working through her meal. She didn't glance up when he entered, continuing to eat as if alone.

Nathaniel's patience snapped. "Evelyn," his voice cut through the silence like a blade, "is that attitude really necessary?"
###Chapter 31

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of our penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. I stretched beneath the silk sheets, my fingers brushing against the cold emptiness of Nathaniel's side of the bed. Again.

My phone buzzed on the nightstand. A text from Gregory: "Emergency meeting at 9. Summit Realty is pulling out of the waterfront project."

I groaned, rubbing sleep from my eyes. This project was supposed to be my comeback after the Pineview Villa fiasco. Now it was crumbling before we'd even broken ground.

The shower did little to wash away my frustration. As I towel-dried my hair, my reflection in the fogged mirror showed dark circles under my eyes. The stress of the past month was written all over my face.

The kitchen smelled of freshly brewed coffee. Alfred, ever efficient, had laid out breakfast. "Mr. Martin left early again, ma'am," he informed me as I grabbed a croissant.

I nodded, chewing mechanically. Nathaniel had been distant since the gala, buried in work or... I didn't let myself finish the thought.

My phone buzzed again. This time it was Caroline: "You'll never guess who I just saw at The Grand having breakfast with Sebastian Wilson."

A photo followed. My stomach dropped.

There, at a corner table of the most exclusive hotel in the city, sat Nathaniel deep in conversation with Isabella Davis. Her perfectly manicured hand rested on his forearm, her crimson lips curved in that familiar, predatory smile.

The croissant turned to ash in my mouth.

Gregory was pacing when I arrived at the office. "They're citing 'creative differences,'" he said, throwing air quotes around the words. "But we all know what this is really about."

I didn't have to ask. My falling out with Edward Martin had sent ripples through the entire industry. No one wanted to cross the Martin family, not even for a Mitchell.

My computer pinged with a calendar reminder: Lunch with Victoria Martin - 12:30.

Right. My mother-in-law's monthly interrogation disguised as a social call. Perfect timing.

The morning passed in a blur of damage control calls and revised blueprints. At 11:47, my office door flew open without warning.

Nathaniel stood in the doorway, his tie slightly askew, eyes blazing. "We need to talk."

Gabrielle hovered nervously behind him. "I tried to stop him, Evelyn—"

"It's fine," I said, though nothing about this felt fine. "Close the door on your way out."

The moment the latch clicked, Nathaniel tossed his phone onto my desk. The screen displayed the same photo Caroline had sent me.

"Before you jump to conclusions," he said through clenched teeth, "it wasn't what it looked like."

I crossed my arms. "Then enlighten me. What exactly was my husband doing having a cozy breakfast with his ex at the same hotel where he proposed to me?"

His jaw worked. "She reached out about a business opportunity. I was going to tell you—"

"When? After the next photo op?" I pushed back from my desk, needing space. "Do you have any idea how this looks? Especially now, with everything that's happening?"

Nathaniel ran a hand through his already disheveled hair. "That's exactly why I didn't mention it. I knew you'd overreact."

"Overreact?" My voice climbed an octave. "Our biggest client just dropped us because of your family, and you're sneaking around with Isabella?"

"I wasn't sneaking!" His shout made the glass walls vibrate. Lowering his voice, he added, "I'm trying to fix things, Evelyn. But you're so busy assuming the worst of me that you can't see that."

The intercom buzzed. Gabrielle's voice, tense: "Evelyn, your mother-in-law is on line two. She says she's waiting at the restaurant."

Nathaniel and I locked eyes in a silent standoff.

"Go," he finally said, stepping back. "We'll finish this tonight."

As I grabbed my purse, my fingers brushed against the small velvet box in the side pocket. The pregnancy test I'd taken three days ago. Positive.

Somehow, in the middle of all this chaos, I'd forgotten to tell my husband we were having a baby.

Evelyn looked up at him, her eyes narrowing slightly. "How is that possible?"

"What exactly are you implying?"

"I didn’t do anything wrong."

"We usually have dinner together, but today, I didn’t hear a word from you. Is this how you fulfill your duties as my wife?"

Nathaniel’s tone was sharp, laced with unmistakable displeasure.

Evelyn responded with a bitter smile. "Nathaniel, you’re willing to neglect your own health for Ms. Davis. How was I supposed to know if you’d even come home for dinner? And if I called, there’s no guarantee she wouldn’t answer. Why bother?"

She was still seething over last night—how he had ignored his well-being, something she couldn’t simply overlook.

But Nathaniel didn’t see it that way.

"Are you still upset about what happened at the restaurant?" he asked coolly.

"Are you referring to you choosing to dine with Ms. Davis instead of Victoria and me? Or the way she clung to you right in front of us?"

He shouldn’t have brought it up, but he did—deliberately.

It was like pouring salt into an open wound, and it stung.

Nathaniel’s gaze darkened. "It was a misunderstanding. Did you expect me to let her fall?"

"I never said that."

"But that’s what you meant, isn’t it?"

"Nathaniel, if you already think so little of me, why bother explaining?"

Evelyn was beginning to realize she no longer recognized the man standing before her.

The tension between them thickened.

Alfred, the butler, chose that moment to bring Nathaniel’s dinnerware to the table. Sensing the charged atmosphere, he quickly retreated without a word.

Once seated, Nathaniel finally spoke again. "You knew I was having Italian with Isabella, so you deliberately brought my mother along? Haven’t I made it clear that during this marriage, I wouldn’t humiliate you? Why must you provoke me?"

Evelyn was speechless.

She stared at him, incredulous. "So you’re accusing me of scheming to bring Victoria? Nathaniel, you can favor Isabella all you want, but don’t twist the truth. She chose the restaurant. How was I supposed to know you’d be there?"

Nathaniel studied her, as if weighing the sincerity of her words.

His response was ice-cold. "Didn’t you hear her mention Italian food when I was on the phone with you?"

"If you’ve already decided it’s my fault, then fine," she said, too exhausted to argue. What was the point? His mind was made up.

Loving someone meant they could hurt you in countless ways.

This past year of marriage—respectful yet distant—had almost fooled her into thinking this was normal. But now she understood: it was only because Isabella hadn’t been around.

This was the reality of her marriage to Nathaniel.

She had tried, over and over, to salvage it, to hold on to him. But it was futile. His eyes only ever saw Isabella—never her.

And if it was going to end in his contempt, she’d rather cut it clean now.

Dinner was unbearable. Nathaniel’s accusations had killed Evelyn’s appetite. She felt sick—physically and emotionally. She barely kept anything down, making sure to avoid Nathaniel when she excused herself.

The next morning, Evelyn left early for work, taking her own car instead of waiting for Nathaniel.

At the office, Gregory handed her a document. "Here’s the signed contract with Summit Realty. Want to review it?"

Evelyn shook her head. "You handle it."

Gregory set it down, then took a seat across from her. His gaze was steady. "In a few days, we’ll meet with Summit Realty’s head at Martin Group to present our designs. We’ll be collaborating closely with them for the next six months—which means running into Nathaniel. What’s your plan?"

Evelyn hesitated. "Plan?"

"About the divorce."

"Edward is still in a coma. The divorce has to wait. As for the project, we worked hard for this. We have to see it through. The profits will benefit the company long after I’m gone."

No matter what, she wouldn’t leave her team without a future.

That was her principle.

Gregory’s expression was unreadable, his scholarly features shadowed with something deeper.

Finally, he nodded. "Alright. I’ll support whatever you decide."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. She knew what he wasn’t saying. "Gregory… you don’t have to keep sacrificing for me. I—"

"Evelyn," he interrupted gently, "some choices aren’t sacrifices. They’re just what makes us happy."

He had told her this before—that she shouldn’t feel guilty. This was his choice.

She didn’t argue further. Their eyes met, and for a brief moment, they shared a quiet understanding.

Evelyn worked late, not returning to Pineview Villa until nearly seven.

As she pushed open the gates, something felt off.

Then she saw them—ladies’ flats by the entrance.

Her stomach twisted. A terrible suspicion formed, but she clung to one last shred of hope.

Stepping inside, her gaze landed on the living room sofa—where Isabella sat, right beside Nathaniel.

Evelyn’s chest tightened.

It hurt.

But worse than the pain was the numbness settling over her.

Alfred descended the stairs just then, spotting her. "Ah, Evelyn, you’re back."

She murmured a response, and both Nathaniel and Isabella turned to look at her.

Evelyn met their gazes coolly. This is still my home. If anyone should feel uncomfortable, it’s not me.

She walked forward.

Alfred followed. "Nathaniel, the guest room is ready. If Ms. Davis needs anything else, just let me know."

"Thank you," Nathaniel replied softly.

Alfred retreated to the kitchen.

From his words, Evelyn pieced it together. She turned to Nathaniel, her voice icy. "She’s staying here?"

Nathaniel didn’t flinch. "Isabella was discharged today. She hasn’t found a place yet, so she’ll be staying with us for a while."

Isabella quickly added, "Evelyn, I hope this isn’t an inconvenience. You don’t mind, do you?"

Evelyn ignored her, keeping her eyes locked on Nathaniel.

"You’re telling me she’s moving into our home?"

Her voice was steel.
###Chapter 32

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew over the blueprints as she made last-minute adjustments to the resort project. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the crisp paper smell—a familiar comfort in her chaotic world.

Gabrielle burst in, her heels clicking urgently against the hardwood. "Evelyn, Mr. Wilson is on line one. He sounds... agitated."

Evelyn's stomach knotted. Gregory only used that tone when something was catastrophically wrong. She snatched the receiver. "Gregory? What's happened?"

"Turn on the news. Now." His voice was razor-sharp.

The flat-screen TV flickered to life, revealing a breaking news banner: Martin Group Heir Nathaniel Martin Spotted with Ex-Lover Isabella Davis at Exclusive Malibu Retreat. The footage showed Nathaniel helping Isabella from a yacht, his hand lingering at the small of her back.

Evelyn's coffee cup slipped from her fingers, shattering against the floor. The dark liquid spread like a stain across her carefully constructed reality.

Meanwhile, across town, Nathaniel paced his penthouse like a caged panther. Samuel stood rigid by the door, clutching a manila envelope. "Sir, the paparazzi photos—"

"Were supposed to be contained." Nathaniel's phone buzzed incessantly—twelve missed calls from Edward Martin, each more furious than the last. He raked a hand through his hair. "Where's Vanessa? She swore Isabella understood the terms of their arrangement."

Samuel hesitated. "Ms. Davis's agent claims they had no knowledge of the photographer. But our security team found this." He produced a grainy surveillance still showing Vanessa handing an envelope to a tabloid reporter.

The intercom crackled. "Mr. Martin? Your grandfather's limo just pulled up downstairs."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. The old man never made house calls unless delivering ultimatums. As the elevator descended, his mind raced through damage control scenarios—each more disastrous than the last. He'd promised Evelyn no more scandals. After the miscarriage, after everything...

The elevator doors opened to reveal Edward Martin's steely gaze. "We," he declared, tapping his cane against the marble, "have a problem."

Upstairs, Evelyn stared at her silent phone. Nathaniel hadn't called. Not when the story broke. Not in the three agonizing hours since. Caroline's texts piled up—Have you seen this?, Call me!, Evelyn please answer—but she couldn't bring herself to respond.

Her office door creaked open. Gregory entered, his usually impeccable tie loosened. "The board's emergency meeting starts in twenty minutes. They're voting on whether to suspend our contract with Martin Group." He paused. "Evelyn... are you okay?"

She turned toward the window, where the midday sun now glared mercilessly. Somewhere beyond that skyline, her husband was with another woman. Again. "No," she whispered. "But I will be."

The phone rang. Unknown caller. Evelyn almost didn't answer—until she heard the breathy, unmistakable voice. "Evelyn, darling. We need to talk." Isabella's laugh tinkled like broken glass. "About our shared... interests."

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable, his chiseled features casting an unfamiliar shadow over Evelyn.

"She's only staying temporarily until she finds a suitable place," he explained calmly.

Evelyn's response was sharp. "Nathaniel, that excuse might fool me, but I refuse to believe a man of your resources can't secure proper accommodations for her. Or is Ms. Davis so delicate that only our home will suffice?"

"Evelyn." His voice carried a note of disappointment. "Isabella was hospitalized today. Even if arrangements were made, nowhere else would be as comfortable for her right now. Can't you show a little generosity instead of being so petty?"

"Me? Petty?" A bitter laugh escaped her lips. Words could be so cruel—sharp enough to shatter a person's spirit.

She inhaled deeply, fighting back the sting of tears.

"If this place suits her so well, then I'll leave. Sooner or later, my space needs to be cleared for her anyway."

Her tone was icy as she turned toward the stairs to pack her things.

Isabella quickly intervened, her voice soft. "Evelyn, please don't be upset with Nathaniel. I never meant to intrude. I had nowhere else to go, and because of my situation, he was worried for my safety. I promise, I'll move out as soon as I can."

"What exactly are you implying, Ms. Davis? That I should welcome you with open arms like Nathaniel does?" Evelyn's words dripped with sarcasm.

"That's not what I meant," Isabella murmured, her expression wounded.

Evelyn scoffed. "Then enlighten me. Should I pack up and leave right now to make you happy? Teach me, Ms. Davis—how exactly should I proceed?"

She didn’t know Isabella’s true nature, but one thing was clear: even if their marriage was ending, no one had the right to barge in before it was finalized.

We’re both women. Couldn’t she at least leave me with a shred of dignity?

Isabella remained silent, her pitiful gaze speaking volumes.

Nathaniel’s brows furrowed, his voice firm. "Evelyn, I never intended for Isabella to stay indefinitely. Even if we divorce, Pineview Villa will remain yours. Must you keep pushing like this?"

She stared at him, stunned.

After a year of marriage, how is there not an ounce of kindness left in him? Only relentless hurt?

No matter what, it was always her being unreasonable, her refusing to cooperate.

Realizing the futility, she fell silent.

See it clearly now? He loves only Isabella. He would move mountains for her. Stop clinging to false hope—it’s pointless. The only one getting hurt is you.

This is where my love ends.

Better to cut ties cleanly than cling to a marriage—and a man—who no longer wanted her. At least this way, he could remain the man she once loved in her memories.

Dinner, usually shared between two, now included a third—an unwelcome presence.

Evelyn felt like the intruder. She ate in silence, forcing herself to swallow each bite for the sake of the child growing inside her.

Isabella’s voice was sweet as she urged, "Nathaniel, try this. It’s just like how you used to love it."

She pushed a dish toward him—something Evelyn had done countless times before, only to be met with indifference.

Yet now, he ate it without hesitation.

So it was never about the dish. It was about the person serving it.

Evelyn let out a quiet, humorless laugh, her heart sinking further.

That night passed in a haze. She wasn’t sure if she slept or simply lay awake, drowning in thoughts.

Morning came with the shrill ring of her phone.

Charlotte’s name flashed on the screen.

Evelyn answered quickly. "Charlotte?"

"Evelyn! Your grandfather is awake and asking for you. Can you come to the hospital now?" Excitement laced her friend’s voice.

She bolted upright, ignoring Nathaniel still asleep beside her. "Of course. I’ll be there soon. Take care of him until I arrive."

"Will do."

Hanging up, Evelyn freshened up swiftly and rushed out.

Pineview Villa was quiet in the early hours, the morning air crisp.

At the hospital, she overheard Edward’s gruff voice from the ward. "These past days have been unbearable. If not for trying to keep Evelyn, I wouldn’t have faked illness and ended up here."

Richard’s reply was quick. "Father, it’s my fault for not handling Nathaniel properly."

"Enough. That boy has lost his mind. If he lets a woman like Evelyn slip away, he’ll regret it for life," Edward huffed.

Victoria chimed in, "Father, don’t upset yourself. We’ll talk sense into Nathaniel. Rest now—Evelyn will be here soon."

Standing outside, Evelyn smiled wryly.

She wasn’t angry—just resigned. Edward, Richard, and Victoria were fighting for her, but her fate with Nathaniel was already sealed.

Taking a steadying breath, she knocked and entered.

The three straightened at her arrival, but she pretended not to notice. Seeing Edward looking healthy eased her worry.

He beckoned her over. "Evelyn, were you worried about me?"

She nodded. "Of course, Grandfather. Please take care of yourself—we all worry."

"As long as you and Nathaniel are well, I’ll be fine," he said with a smile.

Evelyn stayed quiet, watching him closely.

Sensing her gaze, Edward changed the subject. "You came so early—you must not have eaten. Go with Victoria and grab something."

"I’m not hungry. I’d rather stay with you," she replied.

"Evelyn, talk with your grandfather. Richard and I will fetch you something," Victoria suggested.

"Thank you," Evelyn said softly.

Victoria smiled. "No need for formalities. We’re family."

As they left, Evelyn turned to Edward, her expression serious. "Grandfather, were you lying to me?"

He avoided her eyes. "Evelyn, my hearing isn’t what it used to be. Oh—my head feels dizzy all of a sudden…"

He turned away like a child caught in a fib, making her chuckle despite herself.

It was strange—she had always connected deeply with Edward. Since her own grandfather passed, he had treated her like his own, always putting her first.

The thought weighed on her heart.

"Grandfather," she said gently, "please don’t do this again. I just want you healthy."

Edward softened. Patting her hand, he promised, "Alright, I was wrong. Forgive me?"

They shared a smile, letting it go.

But Edward added sternly, "Keep this between us. Don’t tell that rascal Nathaniel."

She agreed, knowing he wanted to teach Nathaniel a lesson.

Then he asked, "Has he been giving you trouble lately?"

###Chapter 33

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew over the blueprints, making precise adjustments with her mechanical pencil. The scent of freshly brewed coffee from Gabrielle's desk mingled with the crisp paper smell.

A sharp knock interrupted her concentration. "Come in," she called without looking up.

The door swung open to reveal Nathaniel, his tailored navy suit accentuating his broad shoulders. His usually composed expression held an uncharacteristic tension. "We need to talk," he said, his deep voice unusually tight.

Evelyn's pencil stilled. She recognized that tone—it meant trouble. "About what?" She swiveled her chair to face him fully.

Nathaniel closed the door with deliberate slowness before speaking. "Isabella's back in town." His jaw clenched as he delivered the news. "She contacted me this morning."

The air left Evelyn's lungs. Isabella Davis—Nathaniel's first love, the woman who'd shattered his heart before vanishing three years ago. The same woman whose shadow still lingered between them during their most vulnerable moments.

"She wants to meet," Nathaniel continued, running a hand through his dark hair. "Claims it's urgent business related to the Martin Group."

Evelyn's fingers curled around the edge of her desk. "And you're telling me this because...?"

"Because I want you there with me." His stormy gray eyes locked onto hers. "Whatever she wants, we face it together."

The sincerity in his voice thawed some of Evelyn's rising panic. She exhaled slowly. "When?"

"Tonight. Seven o'clock at The Sapphire Room." Nathaniel stepped closer, his cologne—woodsy with a hint of citrus—wrapping around her. "I know how this looks, but I swear—"

Evelyn held up a hand. "Don't." She stood, closing the distance between them. "I trust you." The words came easier than she expected. "But I don't trust her."

Nathaniel's shoulders relaxed slightly. He cupped her face, his thumb brushing her cheekbone. "Neither do I. That's why we need to be careful."

A buzzing interrupted them. Nathaniel pulled his phone from his pocket, his expression darkening as he read the screen. "It's her again." He showed Evelyn the message: Can't wait to see you, Nate. We have so much to discuss—just like old times.

Evelyn's stomach twisted at the familiar nickname. She forced a neutral expression. "We'll handle this." She squeezed his arm. "Together."

As Nathaniel left to prepare for their evening confrontation, Evelyn sank back into her chair. Her gaze fell on the framed photo on her desk—their wedding day, Nathaniel's arms wrapped around her waist as they laughed under a shower of rose petals. The memory should have comforted her, but instead, a cold dread settled in her bones.

Isabella's return wasn't coincidence. And whatever game she was playing, Evelyn knew one thing for certain—the rules had just changed.

Evelyn hesitated, her gaze dropping to the floor as her thoughts involuntarily drifted to Isabella still residing at Pineview Villa.

Instead of confiding in Nathaniel, she simply shook her head and offered a faint smile. "No."

She didn’t want to burden Edward. Even though this hospital stay was part of their plan to deal with Nathaniel, she would never risk Edward’s health.

"If he dares to trouble you, just tell me. I’ll handle him," Edward declared firmly, his eyes brimming with the protective warmth of a grandfather.

"Alright, I know you’ve always got my back, Grandpa," Evelyn replied softly, patting his leg.

But the combination of skipping breakfast and the sharp scent of disinfectant in the ward suddenly made her stomach churn. Without warning, she bolted to the bathroom and retched violently.

After emptying her stomach, she splashed cold water on her face before returning to Edward’s side.

His sharp eyes studied her. "Evelyn, what’s wrong with you?"

She forced a calm smile. "It’s nothing, Grandpa. Probably just a stomach bug. Don’t worry."

Edward’s gaze didn’t waver. "Evelyn, are you keeping something from me?"

Her breath hitched.

Lying had never been her forte, especially not to Edward, who had always loved her unconditionally.

Biting her lip, she feigned nonchalance. "Grandpa, what are you talking about? Why would I hide anything from you?"

"Evelyn, I may not have spent every day with you, but I know you. Whatever it is, you can tell me. I’ll always stand by you."

Her fingers twisted in her lap. "I’m fine, really. Please don’t worry."

Silence stretched between them before Edward finally sighed. "Since you’re already here, let the doctor examine you. For my peace of mind."

He reached for his phone, but Evelyn caught his wrist, her expression conflicted. "Grandpa, I don’t need a doctor. Please… just drop it."

"Evelyn," his voice softened, "don’t you trust me?"

Her throat tightened. After a long pause, she exhaled shakily. "Grandpa… I’m pregnant."

The air in the room turned still.

She continued, her voice steady but quiet. "I found out after Nathaniel and I decided to divorce. I didn’t mean to keep it from you."

"Does he know?" Edward’s expression darkened.

"No. And I don’t plan to tell him." She met his gaze squarely. "Grandpa, promise me you won’t tell him either. I won’t use a child to salvage a broken marriage. That wouldn’t be fair—not to me, not to Nathaniel, and certainly not to this baby."

Edward remained silent, his jaw tight.

Evelyn’s fingers trembled. "I told you because I trust you. This child will be born, but I refuse to let them be a bargaining chip. I know you wouldn’t want that either."

A heavy sigh escaped Edward. "Evelyn, did Nathaniel do something to hurt you? Is that why you’re so determined to leave?"

She shook her head. "No, Grandpa. Please don’t think that."

"I’m old, not blind," Edward muttered. "If he lets you go, he’ll regret it. Isabella is no saint—nothing like you. If she had half your integrity, I wouldn’t have opposed their relationship in the first place." His voice turned gruff. "But mark my words, losing you will be his greatest mistake."

He reached for her hand. "I won’t tell a soul. But promise me you’ll come to me if you need anything. As long as I’m breathing, no one will mistreat you."

Tears welled in Evelyn’s eyes as she nodded. "Thank you, Grandpa. Truly."

Just then, the door swung open. Victoria and Richard returned with breakfast—followed by Nathaniel.

All three froze at the sight of Evelyn’s tear-streaked face.

Victoria rushed forward. "What happened?"

Evelyn quickly wiped her cheeks. "Nothing. Just reminiscing with Grandpa."

She deftly changed the subject, but Nathaniel’s piercing stare lingered on her.

What was she crying about?

Before he could dwell on it, Victoria called Evelyn over. "Come eat, dear."

As Evelyn passed Nathaniel, their eyes met briefly.

Even under the same roof, we arrived separately. What a terrible wife I’ve been.

Seated at the small table, Evelyn picked at her food while Edward pointedly ignored Nathaniel, staring out the window. Richard cleared his throat, nudging Nathaniel forward.

"How are you feeling, Grandpa?" Nathaniel asked.

Edward scoffed. "Hmph."

"Grandpa, don’t be angry."

"If you don’t want me angry, leave. Out of sight, out of mind," Edward snapped.

No one spoke up for Nathaniel—not even Evelyn, who usually would. But Victoria’s warning glance kept her silent. Let him face the consequences.

After breakfast, Edward waved them off. "Go on. Since he’s so eager to play the devoted grandson, let him stay."

Evelyn shot Edward a grateful look—Thank you for keeping my secret.

As she left with Richard and Victoria, she excused herself. "You go ahead. I need to visit a friend."

"Alright, take care," Victoria said, linking arms with Richard.

Once they were gone, Evelyn turned toward the obstetrics wing.

Back in the room, Nathaniel stood awkwardly under Edward’s glare.

"Sit," Edward barked.

Nathaniel hesitated. "Grandpa, just say what you need to."

"Still disobeying me? Fine. Push me into another heart attack—see if I care."

Nathaniel exhaled and sat.

Edward’s voice turned icy. "I won’t waste breath begging you to treat Evelyn well. If she wants a divorce, I won’t stop her. But remember—this isn’t for you. It’s for her."

His glare sharpened. "However, I have one condition."

Nathaniel tensed. Instead of relief, unease coiled in his gut. "What condition?"

Edward leaned forward. "You know plenty of eligible men, don’t you? Pick one—someone decent, kind, who’ll cherish her. Wealth doesn’t matter. The only requirement?" His lips curled. "He must be better than you."

Nathaniel’s eyes widened. "You want me to set her up with someone?"

###Chapter 34

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, blinking against the light as she stretched beneath the silk sheets. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady and calm. She studied his profile—the strong jawline, the dark lashes resting against his cheeks—and felt a familiar warmth spread through her chest.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand, breaking the peaceful silence. She reached for it, careful not to disturb Nathaniel. A message from Gregory flashed on the screen:

"Evelyn, we need to talk. The Summit Realty deal is getting complicated. Call me ASAP."

Frowning, she slipped out of bed and padded toward the balcony, the cool morning air brushing against her skin. She dialed Gregory’s number, her mind already racing with possibilities.

He answered on the first ring. "You’re awake."

"Barely," she murmured, rubbing her temple. "What’s going on?"

"Sebastian Wilson is making moves behind the scenes. He’s trying to cut us out of the project."

Evelyn’s grip tightened on the phone. "He can’t do that. We signed the contract."

Gregory sighed. "He’s claiming breach of terms. Says we missed a deadline."

"That’s impossible. I reviewed everything last week."

"Then he’s lying," Gregory said flatly. "But he’s got Jonathan Blake backing him up, and they’re pushing hard."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "I’ll handle it. Set up a meeting with Sebastian today."

"You think that’s a good idea?"

"I don’t have a choice. If he’s playing dirty, I need to know why."

Behind her, the bedroom door creaked open. Nathaniel stepped onto the balcony, his shirt half-buttoned, his hair still tousled from sleep. "Everything okay?" he asked, his voice rough with sleepiness.

Evelyn forced a smile. "Just work stuff."

He studied her for a moment, then nodded. "I’ll make coffee."

As he disappeared back inside, Gregory’s voice crackled through the phone. "You sure you don’t want me to handle this?"

"No," Evelyn said firmly. "This is my fight."

She ended the call and leaned against the railing, her thoughts churning. The Summit Realty deal was supposed to be her big break—proof that she could stand on her own in the industry. Now, Sebastian was threatening to take it all away.

But she wouldn’t let him.

Not without a fight.

Nathaniel watched Evelyn from the kitchen as she paced the living room, her phone pressed to her ear. Her expression was tense, her fingers tapping restlessly against her thigh. He poured two cups of coffee and carried them over, setting one on the table in front of her.

She barely glanced at it.

"Talk to me," he said quietly.

She hesitated, then lowered the phone. "It’s Summit Realty. Sebastian’s trying to back out of our contract."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Why?"

"He’s claiming we breached terms, but it’s bullshit. Gregory and I checked every detail."

Nathaniel leaned forward. "Let me help."

She shook her head. "I need to handle this myself."

"Evelyn—"

"I need to," she repeated, her voice firm.

He studied her for a long moment, then nodded. "Okay. But if it gets messy, I’m stepping in."

She gave him a small, grateful smile. "Deal."

Her phone buzzed again—a message from Gregory.

"Meeting set. Noon at their office."

Evelyn took a deep breath.

Showtime.

Nathaniel scoffed, "Excuse me? You want to divorce her, and I'm not allowed to arrange her future?"

Edward Martin's words cut like ice. "Of course I know you're still married. That's exactly why I want you to find her a suitable match before the divorce. Let the world see Evelyn isn't some desperate woman clinging to you."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Does Evelyn know about this?"

"Whether she does or not is irrelevant. Evelyn respects me. She'll listen."

A bitter laugh escaped Nathaniel. "Tell me, Grandfather—am I actually your blood?"

Edward's glare could have frozen hell. "If you weren't, I'd have broken both your legs by now."

Outside these walls, Nathaniel Martin was untouchable—a king whose word shaped empires. Here? He was just a grandson being ordered to play matchmaker for his own wife.

Gritting his teeth, he surrendered. "Fine. I'll handle it."

"See that you do it properly. This isn't some trivial matter. I expect results."

Nathaniel gave a stiff nod, his mind conjuring images of Evelyn smiling at another man—introducing him to Edward as her new love. His fingers curled into fists.

Dismissed, Nathaniel left the hospital in a black mood that clung to him like a storm cloud. His assistant, Samuel, tread carefully, avoiding any missteps that might draw his ire.

——

Across town, Evelyn found her cousin Caroline Sullivan at the hospital—the first person she'd confided in about her pregnancy.

"You're not imposing," Caroline chided, handing her water. "Family doesn't keep score." Checking her watch, she added, "Come on, my friend's on duty. She's the best OB-GYN here—discreet and thorough."

The ultrasound confirmed what Evelyn prayed for: a healthy heartbeat. "Just be cautious these first three months," the doctor advised. "After that, you can resume normal activities."

Relief washed over Evelyn. "Thank you."

Later, over coffee, Caroline studied her. "You're really not telling him?"

Evelyn shook her head. "The divorce makes it irrelevant. And please—don't mention it to the family yet."

Since her last visit to Martin Manor, when she'd hinted at ending the marriage, Margaret Mitchell had gone radio silent. Calls went unanswered.

Caroline, who knew the Mitchell dynamics better than anyone, squeezed her hand. "Aunt Margaret still giving you the cold shoulder?"

Evelyn deflected. "How's work been?"

Recognizing the evasion, Caroline let it go.

——

Leaving the hospital, Evelyn tried Margaret again. A maid answered, tone dripping with disinterest.

"Mrs. Mitchell isn't home."

"My father?"

"Also out." A pause, then dismissal. "Unless it's urgent, I have duties."

The line went dead. Upstairs, Sophia Mitchell smirked at the maid's report. "Good. No need to upset Mother further."

——

That evening, Nathaniel didn't return to Pineview Villa. Instead, he summoned Thomas and others to the Velvet Lounge.

Between drinks, Thomas finally asked, "What's eating you?"

Nathaniel swirled his whiskey. "Grandfather wants me to set Evelyn up with someone before our divorce. Tell me—whose grandson am I, really?"

The group blinked.

Thomas, ever the provocateur, grinned. "Introduce her to me. My parents are hounding me to marry. No feelings now, but who knows?"

Nathaniel's glass hit the table with a crack. "Say that again," he said softly, eyes glacial, "and you'll need reconstructive surgery."

He left without another word.

——

Isabella called as Nathaniel sped toward Pineview. "Aren't you coming home?"

"What do you want?"

Her voice turned saccharine. "Just concerned. Evelyn just got back—must've had a date."

Nathaniel's grip on the wheel tightened. "Isabella, the doctor said you need rest. Go to bed." He hung up mid-protest.

——

Inside the villa, Isabella's frustration boiled over. It's barely 9:30! Since when does he care about my sleep?

Spotting Evelyn sketching at the dining table, she marched over. "Do you have a problem with me living here?"

Evelyn didn't glance up. "What an imagination. Ever considered screenwriting?"

Isabella's smile turned venomous. "Because of you, Nathaniel stays out all night. Evelyn—who do you think you are?"

###Chapter 35

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

She sighed, rolling onto her back. The silence of the villa pressed in on her, heavy and suffocating. Alfred had left her breakfast tray on the nightstand, but the thought of food turned her stomach.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Gregory.

"Meeting with Summit Realty at 10. Sebastian is pushing for revisions. Can you make it?"

Evelyn groaned. Sebastian Wilson had been a thorn in her side since the project began. His constant nitpicking was exhausting.

"I’ll be there," she replied, forcing herself out of bed.

The shower did little to clear her head. As she dressed, her gaze lingered on the framed photo on the dresser—her and Nathaniel on their honeymoon, his arms wrapped around her waist, both of them laughing. When had they last laughed like that?

The drive to the office was a blur. Gabrielle greeted her with a stack of files and a frazzled expression.

"Sebastian’s already here," she whispered. "And he’s brought Jonathan Blake with him."

Evelyn clenched her jaw. Jonathan was worse than Sebastian—smug, condescending, always looking for flaws.

The conference room was tense. Sebastian leaned back in his chair, fingers steepled, a smirk playing on his lips.

"Ah, Evelyn. So glad you could join us."

She forced a smile. "Let’s get started."

Two hours later, she was ready to scream. Sebastian had shot down every proposal, every adjustment.

"Your designs lack vision," he said dismissively.

Gregory shot her a warning look, but Evelyn had had enough.

"Then perhaps you should find another architect," she snapped.

The room fell silent. Sebastian’s smirk widened.

"Careful, Evelyn. You’re not irreplaceable."

Her phone buzzed again. A message from Nathaniel.

"Dinner tonight. Just us. 8 PM."

Her heart skipped. It had been weeks since they’d had a proper meal together.

She exhaled, refocusing on Sebastian. "I’ll make the revisions. But my vision stays."

His eyes gleamed. "We’ll see."

As the meeting adjourned, Gregory pulled her aside. "You okay?"

"No," she admitted. "But I will be."

Because tonight, she’d have Nathaniel back—even if just for a few hours. And right now, that was all she needed.

Evelyn was rendered utterly speechless.

Is Isabella deliberately provoking me because Nathaniel isn't home?

She scoffed inwardly.

Wasn't she all sweetness and light before? Why the sudden change now that Nathaniel's away?

Does she really think I'll just let her walk all over me?

Evelyn met Isabella's gaze coolly. "Isabella, so it's my fault he's coming home late? Perhaps you should reflect on yourself. Maybe he simply doesn’t want to see you. After all, he used to return on time before you moved in."

Of course, this was merely Evelyn retaliating.

In truth, Nathaniel had never been punctual before. But Evelyn had never dared interfere in his affairs.

Just having him return at all had always been enough for her.

Looking back, she realized how easily pleased she had been.

And now, even that small comfort was slipping away.

After delivering her retort, Evelyn ignored Isabella, focusing solely on her laptop screen.

Time blurred until, abruptly, Isabella burst into tears. "Evelyn, I'm sorry. I know I was wrong. I shouldn’t have come here and disrupted your life with Nathaniel. You’re right to ask me to leave. I’ll pack my things now."

Evelyn blinked, bewildered.

What on earth is this woman playing at?

Before she could react, a deep voice cut through the tension. "What's going on here?"

Understanding dawned.

Evelyn’s lips curved slightly, but she said nothing, merely flicking a glance at Nathaniel before returning to her work.

Isabella immediately rushed to his side, her voice trembling. "It's nothing. Evelyn is right. It's only natural she’d want me gone. You two are still married, after all. I’m just an outsider. Nathaniel, I’ll leave tonight."

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed. "Evelyn, did you tell Isabella to leave?"

Hearing her name on his lips, Evelyn finally looked up.

Her expression was blank, her tone flat. "Does it matter if I did?"

"Evelyn, what do you mean by that?"

His face darkened, displeasure flickering in his gaze.

She laughed humorlessly. "Whether it was me or not, you’ve already decided to believe her. So why bother asking?"

"Evelyn, you did say it. You can dislike me, you can demand I leave, but don’t twist the truth."

Isabella stood with her head bowed, tears streaming down her cheeks, the picture of misery.

Nathaniel’s voice softened as he addressed her. "Isabella, no one is forcing you out."

She looked up at him, eyes glistening. "Nathaniel, thank you for believing me."

"Go upstairs and rest."

"Alright. You should rest soon too."

As Isabella ascended the stairs, a faint smile touched her lips.

Once she was gone, Nathaniel approached Evelyn, who continued ignoring him.

Frustrated, he snapped her laptop shut. "Evelyn, I’ve told you—Isabella staying here is temporary. Once arrangements are made, she’ll leave. Why must you push her?"

Evelyn couldn’t believe her ears.

He still thinks it was me?

She exhaled sharply. "Nathaniel, we’ve been married a year. You may not know me well, but I own my actions."

She grabbed her laptop and stood, but he caught her wrist. "Fine. Suppose I believe you didn’t say it. But did you know Grandfather wants me to arrange a match for you before our divorce?"

Evelyn froze.

She ignored his dismissive tone, zeroing in on the latter half of his words.

Her brows knitted. "You said Grandfather wants you to set me up with someone?"

"You didn’t know?"

"Should I have?"

A bitter resignation settled over her.

What is he implying now? That I went behind his back to Grandfather?

"Nathaniel, it’s just Grandfather’s concern for me. You needn’t trouble yourself. I haven’t asked for this, so you can pretend you never mentioned it."

Grandfather probably knows about the baby—worried I’ll raise the child alone. But I won’t jump into another relationship before I’ve even let go of Nathaniel.

Still, his intentions are good. I can’t fault him for that.

Nathaniel studied her, searching for truth in her words.

"Is the reason you refuse my help because you’re still hung up on your ex—or because there’s someone else already?"

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

He thinks I don’t need his help because I’m pining for a fabricated ex—or because I’ve set my sights on another?

Nathaniel, oh Nathaniel. You’ve spun so many theories, but have you ever considered the one I love is you*?*

She pressed her lips together, refusing to answer, meeting his gaze steadily. "Think what you want. I don’t need your matchmaking. Save that time for your precious Ms. Davis."

"Evelyn, must we argue every time we speak?"

"I’m not the one picking fights."

"Then why drag Isabella into this? I’ve told you—this is between us. It has nothing to do with her."

Evelyn remained composed. "Fine. I won’t mention her again."

He always insists it’s just between us, as if Isabella isn’t the reason we’re divorcing.

His bias is staggering.

So afraid I’ll grow to resent her.

Though the conversation ended, a chill settled in Evelyn’s heart.

That night, they shared the same bed—yet miles apart. No words, no touches.

The dynamic had shifted. Where Evelyn had once been the one reaching out, now there was only silence.

And Nathaniel failed to notice.

The next morning, breakfast for two had become three.

Evelyn ate quietly, relieved her nausea didn’t act up. Otherwise, she’d have needed an excuse.

She left without a word.

In this trio, one person was always superfluous.

And Evelyn knew exactly who that was.

Once she was gone, Isabella turned to Nathaniel. "Nathaniel, Evelyn seems upset."

He didn’t respond, Evelyn’s silent departure replaying in his mind. His voice was calm. "Isn’t Vanessa preparing your comeback? Focus on that. Other matters don’t concern you."

Isabella hesitated. "Nathaniel, are you angry about last night?"

###Chapter 36

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She traced the faint scar on his shoulder—a remnant from the accident that had nearly taken him from her. The memory sent a shiver down her spine.

Downstairs, the scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the buttery aroma of croissants. Alfred, ever efficient, had already set the table. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted with a slight bow. "Mr. Martin requested I prepare your favorite."

Evelyn smiled. "Thank you, Alfred. Where is he?"

"Still in bed, madam. He had a late-night call with Mr. Yates regarding the merger."

She sighed. The merger. It had been consuming Nathaniel’s every waking moment. The tension between Martin Group and Summit Realty was palpable, and she knew Sebastian Wilson was playing dirty.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Gregory. "Emergency meeting at the office. Wilson just undercut our bid for the waterfront project."

Evelyn’s grip tightened around her phone. This wasn’t just business; it was personal. Sebastian had been circling her projects like a vulture, and she was done playing nice.

She dressed quickly, opting for a sharp navy blazer and heels—armor for the battle ahead. As she fastened her watch, Nathaniel appeared in the doorway, his tie half-knotted. "You’re leaving already?"

"Gregory needs me. Wilson’s making moves."

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched. "I’ll handle him."

"No." Evelyn met his gaze. "This is my fight. He’s targeting my firm to get to you."

A knock interrupted them. Samuel Yates stood awkwardly in the hall. "Sir, your grandfather’s on the line. He’s insisting."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "Tell him I’ll call back."

Evelyn squeezed his arm. "Go. I’ve got this."

The office was in chaos when she arrived. Gabrielle rushed over, her tablet clutched to her chest. "Wilson’s team leaked false specs to the client. They’re questioning our credibility."

Evelyn’s blood boiled. "Get me the original blueprints and the contract. And find out who’s feeding him information."

Gregory emerged from his office, his usually composed demeanor frayed. "He’s got someone on the inside, Evelyn. There’s no other way he’d know our numbers."

She scrolled through her contacts and paused at Charlotte Bennett. Her best friend had connections in Summit’s HR department. It was a long shot, but worth a try.

Charlotte answered on the second ring. "You’re calling about Wilson, aren’t you?"

Evelyn smirked. "Always one step ahead."

"Meet me at The Velvet Bean in twenty. I’ve got something you’ll want to see."

The café was tucked away in a quiet corner of downtown. Charlotte slid a manila envelope across the table. "Jonathan Blake’s expense reports. Notice anything odd?"

Evelyn flipped through the pages. "These charges... they’re all at The Underground."

"Exactly. And guess who owns that club?"

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. "Donovan Sinclair."

Charlotte nodded. "Wilson’s been funneling money through him. If you can prove it—"

"—We can bury them." Evelyn’s phone buzzed again. Nathaniel. "Edward’s called a family meeting. It’s about the merger. I need you here."

She pocketed the envelope. "Duty calls."

Charlotte winked. "Go get ’em, tiger."

As Evelyn stepped into the sunlight, her resolve hardened. Sebastian Wilson had no idea who he was messing with.

And she was done holding back.

He didn’t even glance at Isabella, his voice cool and detached. "No."

"But you don’t seem happy," Isabella murmured, her fingers twisting nervously in her lap.

Nathaniel’s piercing gaze locked onto her, icy and unyielding, enough to make anyone shrink back.

Isabella felt a shiver of fear, her eyes flickering with hesitation as she met his stare.

Yet Nathaniel merely added, calm and controlled, "I’m leaving for Dattlech this afternoon. I’ll be back in two days. If you need anything, contact Olivia. She’ll handle it. And while I’m gone, stay away from Evelyn. Understood?"

Olivia Clarke was Nathaniel’s assistant—sharp, efficient, and utterly loyal.

Isabella hesitated.

But she nodded quickly. "Fine. I understand."

Still, she couldn’t shake the suspicion that his last words held a deeper warning. Did Evelyn say something to him last night?

She bit her lip, too afraid to ask.

Nathaniel hadn’t told Evelyn about his trip. She only found out from Isabella when she returned to Pineview Villa that evening.

Evelyn’s reaction confirmed Isabella’s suspicion—she hadn’t known. So, Isabella promptly dismissed Nathaniel’s instructions from her mind. With a smug smile, she said, "Evelyn, Nathaniel treats me like his wife now. He tells me his schedule, not you. If I were you, I’d file for divorce immediately."

Evelyn merely gave her a cold look, refusing to engage.

But Isabella seized the moment. "Evelyn, when are you and Nathaniel divorcing? His grandfather is awake now, isn’t he? Or do you plan to cling to him forever?"

"If you’re so curious, ask Nathaniel yourself. Our divorce is between us. Ms. Davis, why do you care?" Evelyn replied, her voice flat.

After all, Nathaniel had made it clear—their business didn’t involve Isabella.

Frustration flared in Isabella’s eyes. "Nathaniel doesn’t love you. He only married you because of Sir Edward’s pressure. Without that, do you honestly think he’d have chosen you? Everything you have now—it should’ve been mine. You’re just a placeholder."

"And yet, here we are. Married. If you want me to divorce him so badly, behave yourself. Otherwise, I might just refuse. And Sir Edward? He’ll side with me. Even if Nathaniel disagrees, he won’t defy his grandfather," Evelyn countered smoothly.

"You’re shameless."

"Still not as shameless as you."

"You—!"

Isabella was too furious to speak. Evelyn turned and walked upstairs without another word.

Watching her retreat, Isabella’s chest burned with resentment. But she quickly composed herself, her mind already spinning new schemes.

Upstairs, Evelyn shut the bedroom door and finally let her mask slip.

Isabella isn’t entirely wrong, she thought bitterly. I am the one clinging now.

If Sir Edward hadn’t forced their marriage, Nathaniel would’ve married Isabella long ago.

They might even have had a child by now.

So yes. I’m the unwanted third wheel.

The thought crushed her.

She had loved Nathaniel for ten years—fallen for him at first sight, dreamed of a lifetime together. But this past year had been enough.

The next two days passed without incident.

Evelyn buried herself in work, finalizing her sketches. Isabella, meanwhile, busied herself with preparations for her comeback.

Since Nathaniel hadn’t even bothered to tell Evelyn about his trip, the message was clear: We don’t communicate.

So Evelyn didn’t reach out.

And the days slipped by, uneventful.

On the third morning, Sir Edward was discharged.

Uncertain when Nathaniel would return, Evelyn arrived early to handle the discharge, alongside Richard and Victoria.

After Sir Edward’s final check-up, the doctor noted slightly elevated blood pressure and sugar levels—but otherwise, he was stable.

Evelyn personally handled all the paperwork, her devotion evident. Victoria smiled warmly. "Evelyn, take a break. Let the staff handle this. Come sit with your grandfather."

Evelyn finally relented. "Just doing what I can."

"You’re kind, thoughtful, and so devoted."

"Victoria, you’re embarrassing me."

Laughter filled the room.

Evelyn settled onto the sofa, and Sir Edward studied her fondly. "Evelyn, come back to Martin Manor with us. We’ll have dinner tonight—no arguments. Consider it a favor to me."

His hopeful expression was impossible to refuse.

Richard and Victoria chimed in. "Yes, let’s all have dinner together."

Evelyn nodded. "Alright. Otherwise, you’ll sulk, and I’ll never hear the end of it."

"Listen to her! Now she’s teasing me!" Sir Edward’s mock outrage sent Richard and Victoria into another fit of laughter.

The mood was light, joyful.

Once everything was packed, the driver and housekeeper carried the belongings out. Evelyn took Sir Edward’s arm as they left the ward.

"Grandfather, take care of yourself when you’re home. No sneaking sweets, understood?"

"I’ll behave—but only if you visit often to check on me. Otherwise, who’s to say I won’t indulge behind your back?" he teased.

It was his way of asking her to visit more. She smiled, squeezing his hand in silent promise.

As they stepped out of the hospital, the group was in high spirits, smiles all around.

But just as they neared the entrance, Evelyn froze at a familiar voice.

Sir Edward noticed first, following her gaze. His expression darkened instantly.

He slammed his cane against the ground. Richard immediately tensed. "Father? Are you unwell?"

Evelyn snapped out of her daze. "Grandfather?"

Seeing her still so concerned for him, despite everything, touched Sir Edward deeply.

His voice was icy. "Didn’t you all say the boy was away on business? Then why is he here—with her?"

Richard and Victoria turned, spotting Nathaniel with Isabella.

Sir Edward looked at Evelyn. "Did you know he was back?"

Evelyn bit her lip, unsure how to answer. Seeing her hesitation, Sir Edward understood. His voice softened with sympathy. "Oh, child. You’ve been wronged. That ungrateful—"

Evelyn shook her head. "Grandfather, I’m fine. Please don’t upset yourself."

"I am fine. Perfectly fine," he muttered, though his grip on his cane was white-knuckled.

The commotion caught Nathaniel’s attention. His eyes locked onto them—and he strode over without hesitation.

###Chapter 37

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting golden patterns across our bedroom floor. I stretched beneath the silken sheets, savoring the rare moment of tranquility before the storm I knew was coming. Nathaniel's side of the bed was already cold—he'd left for his early meeting without waking me. Again.

My phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. Gabrielle's name flashed across the screen with three missed calls. Something was wrong.

"Evelyn, thank God!" Gabrielle's voice crackled with urgency when I answered. "The Summit Realty deal—it's falling apart. Sebastian Wilson just pulled out, and Jonathan Blake is demanding revisions to the blueprints by noon."

I sat bolt upright, the sheets pooling around my waist. "What? We signed contracts last week!" My fingers tightened around the phone. This wasn't just another project—this was our firm's chance to prove we could handle high-profile clients without Nathaniel's influence.

The marble floors were icy beneath my bare feet as I paced. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, I watched Alfred direct the gardeners below, his movements precise as always. The familiar sight grounded me.

"I've already called Daniel Carter," Gabrielle continued. "He's pulling the original team together at the office. But Evelyn..." Her hesitation made my stomach twist. "There's more. Isabella Davis was spotted having breakfast with Sebastian yesterday at The Grand."

The name hit me like a physical blow. Isabella—Nathaniel's first love, the woman whose shadow I'd never quite escaped. My reflection in the vanity mirror showed dark circles I couldn't blame entirely on lost sleep.

A soft knock interrupted us. "Madam," Alfred's voice carried through the door. "Your mother is on the line. She says it's urgent."

I ended the call with Gabrielle, my mind racing. Two crises before 8 AM. Perfect.

"Margaret?" I answered, bracing myself.

"Evelyn, darling." Her tone was all wrong—too bright, too forced. "Your father and I need to see you today. At the estate. It's about your grandmother Beatrice."

The world tilted slightly. Beatrice had been the bedrock of our family since Grandfather Charles passed. If something happened to her...

"I'll be there by noon," I promised, already calculating how to rearrange my collapsing schedule.

As I dressed, my gaze caught on the framed photo from our wedding—Nathaniel's arms around me, both of us laughing like we hadn't a care in the world. That seemed like another lifetime now.

The intercom buzzed. "Madam," Alfred announced, "Mr. Martin is on his way up. He says it's important."

My pulse stuttered. Nathaniel never came home during work hours. Whatever brought him back now couldn't be good.

The elevator doors slid open to reveal my husband, his usually impeccable tie loosened, a file clutched in his white-knuckled grip. His stormy eyes met mine, and in that moment, I knew.

Our carefully constructed world was about to shatter.

Evelyn thought bitterly, He must have just returned from his trip, yet here he is—rushing straight to the hospital with Isabella. How utterly devoted.

Nathaniel met Edward's gaze. "Grandfather—"

"Do I still hold that title in your eyes? Or are you simply counting the days until I'm gone?" Edward interrupted sharply.

"Grandfather, I would never think that way. Please don't say such things," Nathaniel protested.

Edward ignored him.

Richard stepped in. "Father, your health comes first. Don't waste your energy on him." He shot Nathaniel a cold look. "You claimed you were on a business trip. Care to explain this?"

"I just got back. Isabella wasn’t feeling well, so I took her to the doctor. I assumed with you, Mother, and Evelyn here, I could visit Grandfather at the manor tonight."

"I don’t need your visits. In fact, I might live longer without them," Edward scoffed.

Nathaniel clenched his jaw, swallowing his words. Normally, Evelyn would have smoothed things over, but today, she remained silent.

She had no words left.

She hadn’t even known about his trip until someone else mentioned it. And now, his sudden reappearance with Isabella only deepened the sting.

Edward took her silence as proof of Nathaniel’s neglect.

"See? You’ve hurt her so deeply she won’t even speak up for you anymore. Nathaniel, did we raise you to treat your wife this way?"

Isabella stepped forward, offering a gentle smile.

No one acknowledged her.

She bit her lip. "Mr. Martin, congratulations on your discharge. Are you feeling better?"

Edward snorted. "What? Disappointed I’m not bedridden?"

Isabella paled. "I didn’t mean—"

"Enough. Save your theatrics. I may be old, but I’m not blind. Unlike some."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. Edward’s tone, usually warm with her, was razor-sharp now.

And strangely, it felt good to watch Isabella flounder.

The tension thickened until Isabella whispered, "Mr. Martin, I’m sorry for upsetting you."

"Then stay away. You’re giving me a headache."

Isabella glanced at Nathaniel, pleading silently. He said nothing.

Defeated, she retreated.

Finally, Nathaniel spoke. "Grandfather, it’s crowded here. Let the driver take you back to the manor first."

"Now you’re dictating my schedule?"

"That’s not what I meant."

"Save it. Be at dinner tonight, or consider yourself no longer part of this family."

Edward turned to Evelyn, his expression softening. "Come, Evelyn. Let’s not let certain people ruin our day."

Evelyn nodded, guiding him out.

Richard glared at Nathaniel but held his tongue. Victoria hissed, "Fix this mess—or I will."

Then she left.

Nathaniel stood frozen, watching them go. Isabella touched his arm. "Nathaniel, your grandfather is angry. Shouldn’t you go after him?"

He turned to her. "No. You said you weren’t feeling well. Let’s see the doctor."

She nodded, but her smile didn’t reach her eyes.

She had timed this perfectly—calling him the moment he returned, claiming headaches, fragments of that night resurfacing.

And he’d come.

But now, she wondered: Was he staying out of guilt? Obligation?

She studied his profile, but his thoughts remained unreadable.

By seven, the manor was alive with laughter.

Edward, in high spirits, presided over the lavish dinner spread.

Nathaniel entered the hall. "Grandfather. Mother. Father."

Silence.

Edward beckoned Evelyn. "Sit beside me, dear. Eat well."

"Thank you, Grandfather. You too."

Edward beamed.

Nathaniel observed them, his expression unreadable.

Midway through the meal, Edward set down his fork.

"I’ve decided. If divorce is what you both want, I won’t stand in the way. Life’s too short for forced unions. You have my blessing."

The table stilled.

Evelyn’s grip on her spoon tightened. She’d wanted this—so why did it feel like a knife to the chest?

Victoria gasped. "Father! You always supported their marriage. Why change your mind now?"

"I won’t let Evelyn suffer humiliation. He flaunts that woman publicly. Enough is enough."

Richard stayed silent, tacitly agreeing.

Nathaniel, too, said nothing.

Edward locked eyes with him. "Well? Happy now? When will you finalize the divorce?"
###Chapter 38

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew over the blueprints, making precise adjustments with her mechanical pencil. The scent of freshly brewed coffee from Gabrielle's desk mingled with the crisp paper smell.

A sharp knock interrupted her concentration. "Come in," she called without looking up.

The door swung open to reveal Nathaniel, his tailored navy suit accentuating his broad shoulders. His usual composed expression was replaced by something unreadable. "We need to talk," he said, his voice low.

Evelyn's pencil stilled. She recognized that tone—the one he used before dropping life-altering news. "About?"

"Edward just called an emergency board meeting." Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "He's pushing for immediate approval of the waterfront project."

Her stomach dropped. "But we haven't finalized the environmental impact reports—"

"I know." He ran a hand through his dark hair, a rare sign of agitation. "That's not all. Isabella's back in town."

The pencil snapped between Evelyn's fingers. A jagged piece clattered onto the blueprint, leaving an ink smudge across her carefully drawn elevations. She didn't need to ask why this mattered. Everyone in their circle knew Isabella Davis was Nathaniel's first love—the woman who'd left him at the altar five years ago.

Gabrielle appeared in the doorway, her tablet clutched to her chest. "Mr. Martin? Your grandfather's on line one. He says it's urgent."

Nathaniel's phone buzzed simultaneously. He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening further. "Tell him I'll call back."

As Gabrielle retreated, Evelyn stood, brushing graphite dust from her slacks. "You should take that. Edward doesn't call unless—"

"I know what this is about." Nathaniel stepped closer, his cologne—sandalwood with a hint of bergamot—wrapping around her. "The board wants to replace you as lead architect."

The words hit like a physical blow. "On whose authority?"

"Officially? Project efficiency concerns." His gaze locked onto hers. "Unofficially? Someone's been feeding them misinformation about delays."

Evelyn's mind raced. She'd worked eighty-hour weeks on this development. Every deadline had been met. "Isabella," she breathed.

Nathaniel didn't confirm, but the muscle twitching in his jaw spoke volumes. "Meet me at Martin Tower in an hour. Wear the navy Chanel."

As he strode out, Evelyn's phone lit up with a notification from Charlotte: Just saw Isabella at The Plaza. She's meeting with Sebastian Wilson. Thought you should know.

Her blood ran cold. Sebastian Wilson—Summit Realty's CEO and Edward Martin's longtime rival. If Isabella was cozying up to him while sabotaging Evelyn's position...

The intercom buzzed. "Ms. Mitchell?" Gabrielle's voice wavered. "Vanessa Rue is on line two. She says it's regarding a... personal matter between you and Ms. Davis?"

Evelyn's fingers hovered over the receiver. Vanessa was Isabella's bulldog of a publicist. Whatever this was, it wouldn't be good. She took a steadying breath and pressed the button. "Evelyn Mitchell speaking."

"Darling," purred Vanessa's smoky voice. "Isabella's hosting a charity gala tonight at the Met. She insists you and Nathaniel attend. Consider it... a peace offering."

A trap, more like. Evelyn eyed the broken pencil on her desk. "We'll see if our schedule permits."

Vanessa's laugh grated like nails on slate. "Oh, you'll want to clear your calendar. Isabella's making a special announcement about her new partnership with Summit Realty. Something about... repurposing historic buildings?" The line went dead.

Evelyn's stomach twisted. The waterfront project included three landmarked structures she'd fought to preserve. If Isabella and Sebastian teamed up...

Her office door burst open again. This time, Gregory stormed in, his usually impeccable tie loosened. "Turn on CNBC. Now."

The flat-screen on her wall flickered to life. A blonde anchor smiled brightly. "...exclusive report that Martin Group may abandon its signature waterfront development amid rising costs. Sources say Summit Realty is poised to take over the project with a new design team led by former Martin associate Isabella Davis—"

Evelyn's vision tunneled. This wasn't just professional sabotage. ^P

Nathaniel's brow furrowed slightly, his tone laced with displeasure. "Grandfather, did you agree out of anger, or do you truly respect our decision?"

Edward's expression remained icy. "What difference does it make?"

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "If Evelyn and I divorced without consulting you, there’s nothing you could do to stop us. But I came to you because I hoped for your understanding—not your resentment."

"Oh, listen to my grandson, lecturing me now. How impressive..."

Edward coughed violently, and Evelyn, being the closest, immediately stood and moved to his side. She rubbed his back gently before pouring him a glass of water. "Grandfather, please don’t upset yourself. Your health is what matters most."

"Evelyn, I regret ever pushing you into this marriage."

She shook her head, offering a small smile. "Don’t say that. I’ll always be grateful to you. As for the divorce… perhaps it’s for the best. People change, and so do their paths, right?"

In her heart, she knew—without Edward, she never would have had this year with Nathaniel. And for that, she was thankful.

Her words seemed to soften Edward’s resolve.

But then he spoke again, his voice firm. "You may divorce, but on one condition."

"Name it," Nathaniel and Evelyn said in unison.

"You’ve been married a year and barely spent time here at Martin Manor. For the next two days, you will stay here—together. No leaving. No excuses."

Evelyn blinked in surprise.

Nathaniel went still.

Their eyes met briefly.

Edward added, "Of course, I can’t force you if you refuse."

His words were directed solely at Nathaniel.

Victoria chimed in, her tone gentle but insistent. "Nathaniel, your grandfather isn’t well. Must you always provoke him?"

Richard nodded in agreement. "If this is what he asks, you will honor it."

With no room left to argue, Nathaniel and Evelyn acquiesced.

Edward, ever decisive, wasted no time. "Good. Then you’ll start tonight."

He summoned the staff immediately, instructing them to prepare the master suite with fresh linens and sleepwear.

Though unexpected, the arrangement didn’t faze Evelyn or Nathaniel much. They already lived together at Pineview Villa—this was just a change of scenery.

After dinner, they lingered with Edward in the sitting room. Nathaniel’s cooperation seemed to placate the old man, who finally eased his sharp remarks.

By ten, Edward shooed them away. "Go upstairs and rest. If you need anything, ring for it."

Evelyn nodded, following Nathaniel under Edward’s watchful gaze.

The moment they were out of earshot, Edward turned to Victoria. "We must mend things between them. Find a way to stop this divorce."

Victoria’s lips curved knowingly.

Later, in their private quarters, she murmured to Richard, "Did Edward just imply we should… help Evelyn conceive in two days?"

The room they were given had once been Nathaniel’s. Though Evelyn had stayed at Martin Manor before, she’d never slept in his space.

The staff had laid out fresh clothes and toiletries. An awkward silence stretched between them before Nathaniel finally spoke. "You can shower first."

Evelyn didn’t argue. She simply nodded and disappeared into the bathroom.

As the door clicked shut, Nathaniel’s gaze lingered. The usual warmth in her eyes had dimmed, replaced by something distant. It unsettled him.

While she showered, his phone buzzed. Isabella’s name flashed on the screen.

"Nathaniel, it’s late. Aren’t you and Evelyn coming home?"

His reply was clipped. "We’re staying here the next two days. If you need anything, contact Olivia."

"What? Two days?"

"Yes."

"Are you… traveling somewhere?"

Her voice trembled slightly, though she tried to mask it.

Nathaniel sighed. "No. It’s my grandfather’s condition for the divorce. He wants us here."

"So in two days, you’ll be free?"

"That’s the plan."

Isabella’s joy was palpable. "Nathaniel, does this mean we can finally be together properly?"

He said nothing.

She barreled on, breathless. "I’ve waited so long for this. Every second was worth it. I’d die for you—"

"Isabella, enough. It’s late. Get some rest."

"Of course. Goodnight, Nathaniel."

He ended the call and tossed his phone aside, striding to the balcony. The night air did little to soothe the restless irritation coiling in his chest.

He had wanted the divorce.

So why did the thought of signing those papers suddenly feel like a mistake?

Once it was done, Evelyn would vanish from his life. The Martins might still treat her kindly, but she’d no longer be his. She’d move on—date, marry, have children with someone else.

The thought sent a sharp, unfamiliar anger through him.

Nathaniel scowled. What the hell was wrong with him?

Evelyn emerged from the bathroom to find him on the balcony, his silhouette stark against the moonlight. The loneliness in his posture made her hesitate.

Perhaps he couldn’t stand being near her.

She averted her eyes. "Your turn to shower."

Nathaniel turned, his gaze piercing as he closed the distance between them. "Evelyn, what will you do after the divorce?"

The question caught her off guard. She met his eyes, searching. "I haven’t decided yet. I’ll figure it out when the time comes."

"You haven’t thought about it at all?"

"No."

His jaw tightened. "Will you be with Gregory?"

Evelyn frowned. "I don’t know. The future’s unpredictable."

"Or you just won’t tell me."

She sighed, exhausted. "Nathaniel, neither of us are fortune-tellers."

She moved toward the bed, pulling back the covers, but Nathaniel caught her wrist. His voice was low, urgent. "Do you want this divorce?"

Evelyn froze, staring at him in disbelief.

Then she laughed—soft, bitter. "What, if I said no, would you actually call it off?"
###Chapter 39

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of our penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. I stretched lazily, my fingers brushing against Nathaniel's bare chest. He stirred, his arm tightening around my waist possessively.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he murmured, his voice still thick with sleep. His lips found the sensitive spot behind my ear, sending shivers down my spine.

I turned to face him, tracing the sharp line of his jaw. "Someone's in a good mood today."

Before he could respond, his phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. With a frustrated groan, he reached for it. His expression darkened as he read the message.

"What is it?" I asked, sitting up.

"Edward wants to see us immediately," he said, referring to his grandfather. "Something about the merger."

I frowned. The Martin-Whitmore merger had been smooth sailing so far. "Did something go wrong?"

Nathaniel was already out of bed, pulling on his dress shirt with quick, efficient movements. "I don't know, but we'll find out soon enough."

An hour later, we were seated in Edward Martin's imposing office. The old man's piercing gaze moved between us as he tapped his fingers against the polished mahogany desk.

"I've received some... concerning information," Edward began, his voice like gravel. "It appears Isabella Davis has been making inquiries about our family."

My breath caught. Isabella—Nathaniel's ex and the woman who'd tried to sabotage our relationship multiple times.

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. "What kind of inquiries?"

"Financial records. Property holdings." Edward's eyes narrowed. "She's digging where she doesn't belong."

I exchanged a glance with Nathaniel. This couldn't be good.

"More importantly," Edward continued, "she's been seen meeting with Sebastian Wilson."

My blood ran cold. Sebastian Wilson—the ruthless CEO of Summit Realty and our biggest competitor in the commercial property market.

"Why would she—" I started, but Nathaniel cut me off.

"She's planning something," he said grimly. "And whatever it is, we need to be prepared."

Edward nodded. "I've already instructed Winston to increase security at all our properties. Nathaniel, I want you to—"

The office door burst open, and Samuel Yates rushed in, his usually composed face pale. "Sir, you need to see this."

He handed Nathaniel a tablet. As Nathaniel scrolled through the document, his expression turned thunderous.

"What is it?" I asked, my stomach twisting with dread.

Nathaniel turned the screen toward me. It was a leaked internal memo from Martin Group—detailing our entire strategy for the Whitmore merger. And at the bottom of the document, clear as day, was my electronic signature.

My heart stopped. "That's impossible. I never—"

But the evidence was right there in black and white. Someone had framed me.

Edward's voice was icy. "This was sent to every major news outlet thirty minutes ago. Our stock is already plummeting."

Nathaniel's phone rang. He answered tersely, then hung up. "The board is calling an emergency meeting."

As we stood to leave, Edward's gaze locked onto mine. "Evelyn, I suggest you prepare a very good explanation."

The unspoken accusation hung heavy in the air. Even Nathaniel hesitated before following me out, his trust in me clearly shaken.

By the time we reached the boardroom, my mind was racing. Someone had set me up—but who? Isabella? Sebastian? Or someone else entirely?

The board members' hostile stares burned into me as I took my seat. The chairman cleared his throat. "Mrs. Martin, perhaps you'd like to explain how our most confidential documents ended up in the hands of our competitors?"

I opened my mouth to defend myself, but Nathaniel spoke first. "Before we jump to conclusions, I think we should—"

The door slammed open again. This time, it was Vanessa, Isabella's agent, looking positively gleeful. "Sorry to interrupt," she purred, "but I think you'll want to see this."

She held up her phone, playing a video. The grainy footage showed someone who looked exactly like me sneaking into Nathaniel's office late at night, accessing his computer.

Gasps filled the room. My stomach dropped to the floor.

Because that wasn't me in the video.

But it sure as hell looked like me.

Vanessa smirked. "Isabella will be holding a press conference in one hour to discuss this... unfortunate breach of trust."

As she strutted out, the board members erupted into angry shouts. Nathaniel's face was unreadable as he turned to me.

"Evelyn," he said quietly, "tell me that isn't you in that video."

I reached for his hand, but he pulled away. The rejection stung more than any accusation.

"I swear to you, Nathaniel, that's not me. Someone is setting me up."

The chairman banged his gavel. "Until this matter is resolved, Mrs. Martin, you are suspended from all Martin Group activities effective immediately."

As security approached to escort me out, Nathaniel didn't move to stop them. His silence cut deeper than any words.

The last thing I saw before the doors closed was Isabella's smug face on the television screen, preparing to destroy everything I'd worked for.

And Nathaniel... just letting it happen.

Nathaniel froze momentarily, caught off guard by Evelyn's question. Before he could respond, she had already withdrawn her hand.

"I'm exhausted," she murmured, turning away. "You should shower."

Her tone carried clear resistance as she settled into the pillows. Nathaniel studied her for a long moment before heading to the bathroom, though her words echoed in his mind.

What would he do if Evelyn asked to stay married?

The answer came swiftly - he'd refuse. His promise to Isabella left no room for hesitation.

That night, an uneasy truce settled between them, each haunted by private thoughts.

Evelyn awoke before dawn, Nathaniel's arm anchoring her to the bed. With only two days left of this arrangement, she savored the warmth of his embrace, remaining still until a knock interrupted them.

"Mr. and Mrs. Martin," came the servant's voice. "Sir Edward requests your presence for breakfast."

Before Evelyn could respond, Nathaniel answered, "We'll be down shortly."

He turned to Evelyn, assuming she still slept, and whispered, "Time to wake up, darling."

When she turned instinctively, their noses brushed, locking them in an unexpected moment. Nathaniel's gaze traced her delicate features - the fluttering lashes, flawless complexion so unlike the heavily made-up women he knew. There was an arresting purity to her beauty.

Evelyn found herself equally captivated by his sleep-tousled hair and the tantalizing glimpse of chest visible through his skewed pajamas. The prolonged eye contact grew unnerving.

A sudden realization struck - morning arousal. She turned abruptly to rise, but Nathaniel caught her wrist.

"Running away?" His morning voice was rough yet amused.

"Your grandfather's waiting," she deflected, pulse racing. "Let me go."

"He'd be happier if we stayed in bed longer. Don't you know why?" His teasing tone sent shivers down her spine.

When her hand accidentally grazed his bare chest, Nathaniel trapped it against his skin. "Why won't you look at me, Evelyn?"

Her lips parted slightly as she fought the intoxicating effect of his proximity. "I wasn't avoiding you."

"Prove it." His challenge hung between them.

"Release me first."

"You'll bolt the second I do."

"I promise I won't."

The warmth of his breath on her neck sent tremors through her body. When Nathaniel refused to relent, Evelyn turned reluctantly - only to nearly brush her lips against his.

Nathaniel's eyes darkened. "Was that intentional?"

"Of course not!"

"Liar." Before she could protest further, his mouth claimed hers.

Evelyn froze, only regaining her senses when he pulled back. She scrambled from bed, fleeing to the bathroom where she splashed cold water on her burning cheeks.

"What are we doing?" she berated herself. "We're getting divorced. This can't happen."

Several minutes later, she emerged to find Nathaniel gone - a relief that spared them both awkwardness.

Downstairs, Edward had finished breakfast alone. Victoria was golfing with friends while Richard had left on business. The morning passed quietly with chess games and observation.

At lunch preparation, Evelyn joined Victoria in the kitchen. But cooking odors overwhelmed her, turning her pale. Victoria noticed immediately. "You should rest, dear. We have help here."

"Thank you," Evelyn managed before escaping to fresher air.

In the living room, she discreetly photographed Nathaniel engrossed in chess with his father and grandfather. The image of his focused expression would become another bittersweet memory.

Lunch featured Victoria's specialties: mushroom bisque, filet mignon, lobster thermidor, and delicate pastries. Yet each rich aroma churned Evelyn's stomach.

When Victoria encouraged seconds, Evelyn bolted for the bathroom.

Nathaniel's expression darkened with concern. Edward remained calm. "Her stomach's been sensitive. These rich dishes might be too much."

"Check on her," Edward instructed.

Nathaniel found Evelyn wiping her mouth, pale but composed. "You should have told me you were unwell," he murmured.

"It's nothing," she insisted.

His frown deepened. Back at the table, he announced, "The family doctor needs to examine you. This has gone on too long."

Evelyn's gaze flicked to Edward before protesting, "I've already been checked. It's just a stomach bug."

"Then where's your medicine?" Nathaniel countered, already summoning Dr. Harrison.

Victoria beamed at her son's concern. "How wonderful to see you looking after your wife."

Nathaniel ignored the comment while Evelyn masked her growing panic. As the doctor arrived, her secret hung precariously in the balance.
###Chapter 40

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew over the blueprints, making precise adjustments with her mechanical pencil. The scent of freshly brewed coffee from Gabrielle's desk mingled with the faint aroma of ink and paper.

A sharp knock interrupted her concentration. "Come in," she called without looking up.

The door swung open to reveal Nathaniel, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders. His usually composed expression held an uncharacteristic tension. "We need to talk," he said, his voice low.

Evelyn's pencil stilled. She recognized that tone—the one he used when discussing matters of the heart. "About what?" She kept her voice steady, though her pulse quickened.

Nathaniel stepped closer, his polished shoes silent on the hardwood. "Isabella called me last night."

The pencil slipped from Evelyn's fingers, rolling across the blueprint. She watched it fall to the floor with a soft clatter before meeting his gaze. "And?"

"She's coming back to the city." His jaw tightened. "Permanently."

Evelyn's breath hitched. Isabella Davis—Nathaniel's first love, the woman who'd left him five years ago without explanation. The ghost that still lingered between them during quiet moments. She forced a neutral expression. "When?"

"Next week." Nathaniel ran a hand through his dark hair, a rare sign of agitation. "She wants to meet."

The air between them grew heavy. Evelyn turned back to her blueprints, pretending to study lines that suddenly blurred before her eyes. "You should go," she said carefully. "Closure might be good for you both."

Nathaniel's hand covered hers, warm and firm. "I want you to come with me."

Her head snapped up. "What?"

His thumb traced circles on her knuckles. "I have nothing to hide from you, Evelyn. Not anymore."

The sincerity in his gray eyes made her chest ache. She wanted to believe him—desperately. But the memory of their early days, when Isabella's name would make him distant for hours, crept into her mind like fog.

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed violently. Gregory's name flashed on the screen with three urgent exclamation points. She reached for it with her free hand. "I have to take this."

Nathaniel nodded, releasing her. "Dinner at eight? I'll make reservations."

She managed a small smile. "I'll be there."

As he left, Evelyn exhaled sharply and answered the call. "Gregory, what's—"

"Turn on Channel 7 right now!" Gregory's voice crackled with excitement. "You're not going to believe this!"

Frowning, Evelyn grabbed the remote from her drawer and clicked on the wall-mounted TV. The screen showed a press conference at City Hall. The mayor stood beside a beaming Isabella, who wore a chic cream pantsuit that accentuated her model-like figure.

"—thrilled to announce Ms. Davis as the new director of our Urban Renewal Project," the mayor was saying. "Her international experience will be invaluable as we—"

Evelyn's grip on the phone tightened. The Urban Renewal Project—the same project Martin Group had been negotiating to lead for months. The project Nathaniel had personally promised would be hers to design.

Gregory's voice cut through her spiraling thoughts. "Did you know about this?"

"No," Evelyn whispered. The blueprint beneath her hands—her proposed design for the project's centerpiece—suddenly felt meaningless. "No, I didn't."

As Isabella smiled for the cameras, Evelyn's phone buzzed again. An unknown number. She answered mechanically.

"Evelyn Mitchell?" A smooth female voice purred. "This is Vanessa, Isabella Davis's manager. We'd love to discuss collaborating with you on the mayor's new initiative. Are you free for coffee tomorrow?"

The coincidence was too perfect. Evelyn's fingers turned icy. "How did you get this number?"

A light laugh. "Oh, darling, everyone in this city talks. Ten a.m. at The Ruby? Isabella's treat."

The line went dead before Evelyn could respond. Outside her window, the sunny morning had darkened with rolling clouds. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rumbled.

As the family moved toward the grand foyer, Edward called out, "Evelyn, dear, could you assist me?"

"Of course, Grandfather." Evelyn hurried to his side.

Edward deliberately slowed his pace, waiting until the others had entered before whispering, "Don't fret, child."

"Grandfather, I still don't want Nathaniel to know about... my condition."

"Your secret is safe with me."

Edward gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze. Evelyn exhaled in relief.

Dr. Harrison, the family physician who'd served the Martins for decades, arrived for the routine check-up. After everyone settled in the parlor, Nathaniel spoke first. "Doctor, Evelyn's been having stomach issues lately - frequent nausea. We're concerned."

The doctor opened his mouth to respond when Edward interrupted. "Check my heart first, Harrison. My pulse feels irregular today."

Richard immediately tensed. "Father? Are you unwell?"

"Just precautionary," Edward waved him off. "Come examine me in my chambers." He winked subtly at Evelyn as Dr. Harrison followed with his medical bag.

Victoria frowned. "How odd. Father's never been secretive about his health."

Nathaniel's gaze lingered on Evelyn, who quickly explained, "Grandfather's been overexerting himself. The examination is wise."

"Quite right," Victoria agreed, summoning a maid. "Bring Miss Evelyn some fresh fruit. You've barely eaten, dear."

"Thank you," Evelyn murmured, avoiding Nathaniel's probing stare.

When Dr. Harrison returned ten minutes later, Richard pounced. "Well?"

"Perfect health," the doctor assured before turning to Evelyn. "Now, let's examine you."

After a thorough check-up, he concluded, "Simple gastric irritation. Avoid rich foods, maintain regular hours, and minimize stress." His instructions sounded suspiciously like...

Victoria chuckled. "Honestly, Harrison, if you hadn't specified stomach issues, I'd think Evelyn was pregnant!"

The room froze. Evelyn's fingers clenched the sofa fabric. She chanced a glance at Nathaniel - his piercing gaze locked onto her with unsettling intensity.

Dr. Harrison remained composed. "When the time comes for children, she'll need to be in optimal health. For now, focus on recovery." His meaningful look told Evelyn he'd kept her secret.

As the doctor departed, Victoria tactfully excused herself, leaving the couple alone.

Nathaniel closed the distance, sitting so close their knees almost touched. "Why couldn't you look at me earlier?" His voice was deceptively soft.

Evelyn kept her tone light. "Just preoccupied with health concerns. The diagnosis relieved me."

"Really?" His skepticism hung thick between them.

She forced a laugh. "What else could it be? You think I'm hiding a pregnancy?" The words tasted like ash.

Nathaniel studied her for a long moment before standing. "If you're unwell, inform me immediately. No secrets." The command held an unspoken threat.

Before Evelyn could respond, Winston appeared. "Master Nathaniel, your grandfather requests you - privately."

Nathaniel paused at the doorway, throwing over his shoulder, "Don't move. We're not finished."

In Edward's opulent bedroom, Nathaniel found his grandfather sitting regally by the fireplace. "You wanted to see me?"

Edward steepled his fingers. "I need absolute honesty. Do you truly wish to divorce Evelyn?"

Nathaniel stiffened. "I thought you'd accepted our decision."

"Answer the question." Edward's voice turned steely. "You were meant to marry Sophia initially. Do you know why Charles begged me to let you wed Evelyn instead?"
###Chapter 41

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She tapped her pencil absently against the blueprint, her mind elsewhere. The meeting with Sebastian Wilson loomed in an hour, and she couldn't shake the unease coiling in her stomach.

"Evelyn, you're spacing out again." Gabrielle placed a steaming cup of coffee beside her, snapping her back to reality.

"Thanks," Evelyn murmured, wrapping her fingers around the warm mug. "Just... thinking."

Gabrielle arched a brow. "About Nathaniel?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Among other things."

The truth was, ever since Isabella had resurfaced, Nathaniel had been distant. Not cold, just... preoccupied. And now, with Summit Realty's sudden interest in her firm's latest project, the timing couldn't be worse.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Gregory.

"Running late. Meet you at Summit in 20. Don't sign anything without me."

Evelyn frowned. Gregory was never late.

She grabbed her portfolio and headed out, the weight of the upcoming negotiation pressing on her shoulders. The elevator ride down felt interminable, each second stretching as her thoughts spiraled.

What if Summit Realty wasn't just interested in the project? What if they were after something—or someone—else entirely?

The lobby doors slid open, revealing the sleek, modern expanse of Summit's headquarters. A familiar figure leaned against the reception desk, his smirk sending a jolt through her.

Jonathan Blake.

"Evelyn Mitchell," he drawled, pushing off the desk. "Fancy seeing you here."

Her grip tightened on her portfolio. "Jonathan. I didn't realize you were handling this."

His grin widened. "Surprises keep life interesting, don't they?"

Before she could retort, the elevator dinged, and Gregory strode out, his usual calm demeanor replaced by visible tension.

"Sorry," he muttered, falling into step beside her. "Traffic was hell."

Evelyn shot him a sidelong glance. "You never take the car during meetings."

Gregory's jaw clenched. "Today's different."

Jonathan led them down a corridor lined with glass-walled offices, each step amplifying Evelyn's unease. When they reached the conference room, Sebastian Wilson stood by the window, his back to them, silhouetted against the skyline.

"Ah, Ms. Mitchell," he said without turning. "Right on time."

Evelyn forced her voice steady. "Mr. Wilson."

He finally faced them, his smile not quite reaching his eyes. "Let's talk business."

As the door clicked shut behind them, Evelyn couldn't shake the feeling that this meeting was about far more than a project.

And she was right.

Sebastian slid a folder across the table. "Before we discuss the proposal, there's something you should see."

Evelyn opened it—and froze.

Inside were photos. Of her. Of Nathaniel.

And Isabella.

Her breath hitched. "What is this?"

Sebastian's smile turned razor-sharp. "Insurance."

Gregory stiffened beside her. "You son of a—"

"Ah-ah." Sebastian held up a hand. "Play nice, or these go public. And trust me, Nathaniel won't survive the scandal."

Evelyn's pulse roared in her ears. This wasn't a negotiation.

It was a trap.

And she'd just walked right into it.

"Because Charles wished to entrust her to me, hoping I could bring her back and that the Martin family would stand as her foundation and support. Charles was already gravely ill at the time. Despite the help he gave me years ago, he never once asked for repayment. This is the first—and last—time."

"Evelyn is a remarkable woman. Above all, I feel indebted to Charles and to her. If you insist on divorce, I won’t stand in your way. But Nathaniel, as a Martin, you bear the responsibility for the debts our family owes. Without Charles, we might not even be having this conversation now."

Years ago, Charles had extended a lifeline to Edward—one that had arrived just in time. Without it, Edward might not have survived.

Though the two families had never been particularly close, their relationship had always remained cordial.

Edward’s words left Nathaniel silent. Then Edward added, "I’m not imposing moral obligations on you. You know full well the Martins owe the Mitchells. I promised Charles I would secure Evelyn’s happiness for life. When you divorce, I will publicly declare her my god-granddaughter and arrange a marriage for her under the Martin name. Additionally, I will transfer a portion of the company’s shares to her in my name as a wedding gift. I want you to be prepared for that."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened as Edward spoke. Though he had previously been tasked with finding Evelyn a suitable partner before finalizing the divorce, Edward’s stance had clearly shifted.

Nathaniel remained silent for a long moment.

Edward pressed, "Now that I’ve explained everything, what are your thoughts?"

"Grandfather, we’re not divorced yet. Isn’t it unfair to me that you’ve already planned so much?"

Edward chuckled, his eyes narrowing with a cold smirk. "And what you’ve done—is that fair to Evelyn? You’re still married, yet you allow Isabella to live in Pineview Villa. Nathaniel, do you call that fair?"

Nathaniel’s gaze darkened, his displeasure barely restrained. "Grandfather, I have my own plans."

"Fine. You’re grown now—I can’t control you anymore. So don’t speak to me about fairness. In two days, you can proceed with the divorce."

With that, Edward dismissed Nathaniel with a wave of his hand.

Leaning back in his chair, Edward closed his eyes, exhaustion weighing on him. Just then, Winston entered, approaching quietly before murmuring, "Why not tell Nathaniel the truth directly? It might stop him from going through with the divorce."

"Evelyn refuses to use the child to keep him. If he wants to leave her, let him. He’ll regret it one day."

Edward gave a derisive snort and fell silent. Some things could only be resolved with time. The final outcome wouldn’t be clear until the very end.

The tension between Evelyn and Nathaniel had eased during their two days at Martin Manor.

They were nearly inseparable, their interactions reminiscent of the days before the divorce loomed over them.

They did everything together—like any ordinary couple.

But Evelyn knew better. All of this was orchestrated by Edward.

Two days passed in the blink of an eye, bringing them to the brink of divorce.

That morning, Evelyn and Nathaniel had breakfast with Edward, Richard, and Victoria. No one mentioned the divorce—an unspoken agreement.

After the meal, Edward took the initiative. "You’ve stayed with me for two days. I won’t go back on my word. Set a time to finalize the paperwork."

Evelyn nodded. So did Nathaniel.

Richard and Victoria said nothing. Edward had made his decision.

Evelyn and Nathaniel didn’t linger. After a brief pause, they left Martin Manor together.

In the car, Nathaniel drove while Evelyn sat in the passenger seat.

She broke the silence. "When do you want to go through with it? How about now?"

Frowning, Nathaniel replied coolly, "Are you in a hurry?"

"What?"

"If not, can we postpone until tomorrow? I’ve been away from the office for two days. After I drop you off, I need to handle some urgent matters. Is that acceptable?" His tone was deceptively gentle.

Evelyn understood. Business wasn’t trivial, so she nodded. "Fine. Tomorrow morning, then."

"Agreed," Nathaniel said flatly. It was a perfunctory reply.

But Evelyn didn’t notice. Her mind was elsewhere. Once it’s done tomorrow, I’ll have to move out. I should start looking for a place. Nathaniel promised to leave Pineview Villa to me, but living alone in such a massive house… I don’t want that.

After dropping her off, Nathaniel headed straight to the office.

When Evelyn stepped inside Pineview Villa, Isabella approached with a faint smile—until she saw who it was. Her expression soured. "You? Where’s Nathaniel?"

She peered behind Evelyn, but no one else was there.

Ignoring her, Evelyn moved to walk past.

Isabella quickly blocked her path. "Evelyn, I’m talking to you. Where is Nathaniel?"

"Isabella, who are you to me? Why should I answer you?" Evelyn’s voice was icy.

Isabella stiffened, shooting Evelyn a glare that went ignored. Instead, Evelyn cast her a dismissive glance and continued upstairs.

Furious, Isabella stomped her foot, her hatred deepening. She shouted after Evelyn, "Don’t think spending two days at Martin Manor changes anything! Nathaniel told me he only went because his grandfather insisted. Now that you’ve satisfied Edward, hurry up and divorce him. Stop wasting his time!"

Evelyn paused, her eyes widening briefly in shock.

But she didn’t respond. She didn’t even turn around. She simply walked straight to the bedroom.

A bitter ache settled in her chest. She knew exactly how well Nathaniel treated Isabella—but she hadn’t expected him to share even this with her. He had assured Evelyn their divorce was a private matter, yet he’d confessed everything to Isabella.

Nathaniel, you really do have double standards.

With the divorce scheduled for the next morning, Evelyn postponed her work. Gregory didn’t press further, only saying, "Let me know if you need anything. Evelyn, we’re friends. Don’t treat me like a stranger, alright?"

His tone was almost pleading, making refusal impossible.

Evelyn agreed. "I’m finalizing the divorce with him tomorrow."

"Tomorrow? It’s decided?"

"Yes. Edward has given his consent."

"And you? Can you let him go?" Gregory asked softly. He knew better than anyone how deeply Evelyn loved Nathaniel. After all these years, it was ending—but was she truly ready?

Evelyn smiled faintly. "I’ve never had a say in our relationship. I don’t want to torment myself anymore."

It was an answer to Gregory—and a reminder to herself. Her resolve was absolute.

The day slipped away, unbearably swift.

Evening arrived. Nathaniel returned from work.

Dinner at Martin Manor had been warm these past two days. Now, with three at the table, the atmosphere was stifling. One of them was always an outsider.

Evelyn stayed silent throughout.

Isabella, however, spoke up calmly. "Nathaniel, Evelyn mentioned you’re finalizing the divorce tomorrow. Should we move out?"
###Chapter 42

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She traced the sharp line of his jaw with her fingertips, marveling at how peaceful he looked.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Mrs. Martin?" Alfred's voice came through the door. "Mr. Edward has requested your presence in the study."

Evelyn sighed, slipping out of bed. She dressed quickly, choosing a simple yet elegant navy dress. The house was quiet as she made her way downstairs, her heels clicking softly against the marble floor.

Edward Martin sat behind his mahogany desk, his expression unreadable. "Ah, Evelyn. Come in." He gestured to the chair opposite him. "We need to discuss the upcoming gala."

She sat, folding her hands in her lap. "Of course. What did you have in mind?"

Edward leaned forward, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "This isn't just any event. It's a statement. The Martins must appear united, especially after... recent events." His tone carried an unspoken weight.

Evelyn's stomach tightened. He was referring to Isabella's sudden reappearance. "I understand," she said carefully. "Nathaniel and I will ensure everything goes smoothly."

A faint smile touched Edward's lips. "Good. Because there's more." He slid a folder across the desk. "Take a look."

She opened it, her breath catching. Inside were blueprints—her designs for the new Martin corporate headquarters. "These were rejected weeks ago."

"Reconsidered," Edward corrected. "Your vision aligns with what we need. But there's a condition."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "Which is?"

"The project must be completed in six months. Any delays, and we revert to the original plans."

Six months was nearly impossible. Yet the opportunity to leave her mark on the Martin legacy was undeniable. She met Edward's gaze. "I'll make it happen."

As she left the study, her phone buzzed. A message from Gregory: Emergency meeting at the office. Now.

Evelyn hurried out, her mind racing. The gala, the project, Isabella's looming presence—it was all converging too quickly.

At the architecture firm, Gregory's face was grim. "We have a problem," he said, handing her a tablet.

The screen displayed a tabloid headline: Scandal Revisited: Nathaniel Martin's Secret Past with Isabella Davis. Accompanying it were old photos of Nathaniel and Isabella, intimate and damning.

Evelyn's hands trembled. "Who leaked these?"

"Anonymous source," Gregory said. "But the timing is suspicious."

She clenched her jaw. Isabella's doing, no doubt. The gala was in three days. If this scandal erupted now...

Her phone rang. Nathaniel's name flashed on the screen. She answered, bracing herself.

"Evelyn," his voice was strained. "We need to talk."

Nathaniel's brow furrowed slightly as his gaze instinctively sought Evelyn. His response to Isabella came in a low murmur, "Did Evelyn mention we're finalizing everything tomorrow?"

"That's what she told me when she returned this morning. Isn't that right, Evelyn?" Isabella turned with practiced sweetness toward Evelyn, her demeanor a stark contrast to their private encounters.

Evelyn met her glance briefly before looking away, offering no response. The silence stretched, leaving Isabella visibly uncomfortable.

She leaned closer to Nathaniel, whispering, "Since you and Evelyn are proceeding with the divorce, perhaps we should relocate. You mentioned gifting the villa to Evelyn in the settlement. Staying here afterward might... appear inappropriate."

Nathaniel's patience wore thin. "Is that what you want?" His question, though directed at Evelyn, carried an edge of frost.

Their eyes locked—his like winter frost, sharp enough to burn. Evelyn held his gaze steadily. "I won't be living here post-divorce. If you haven't found suitable arrangements yet, you're welcome to stay."

Nathaniel owned half the city's luxury properties. His claim about lacking appropriate housing for Isabella was transparently flimsy—a thinly veiled excuse to remain near her. But soon, none of it would concern Evelyn anymore. She refused to dwell on it further.

His displeasure simmered through dinner, an unspoken storm brewing beneath his controlled exterior. By nightfall, he retreated to his study while Evelyn withdrew to their bedroom. When he finally joined her hours later, sleep had already claimed her.

Dawn arrived without fanfare. At six sharp, Nathaniel emerged from the master suite, bypassing breakfast entirely. As he stepped toward his car, a voice halted him. "Nathaniel, leaving so early?"

He turned to find Isabella hurrying toward him, her sundress fluttering. "Just heading to the office," he replied. "You're up early."

Her smile was bright. "Since you're finalizing the divorce today... might I join you? For support?"

His jaw tightened. "At the courthouse?"

"If that's alright? I'd like to be there for you." Her hopeful expression didn't waver.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "Courthouse opens at nine. I have work first."

"Oh, I don't mind waiting at the office with you."

"Suit yourself." His terse agreement sent her scrambling into the passenger seat.

Evelyn woke at seven to an empty bed. Downstairs, Alfred informed her, "Mr. Martin departed earlier with Ms. Davis."

"I see." Her voice remained steady, but the words settled like stones in her stomach. Where would he take her at dawn? The unspoken question twisted inside her. Celebrating their newfound freedom already?

The ache was insidious—tiny, relentless teeth gnawing at her composure. After forcing down toast, she drove straight to the courthouse alone, assuming Nathaniel would meet her there after his... diversions.

Meanwhile, on the top floor of Martin Group's headquarters, Nathaniel sat immersed in documents while Isabella waited patiently across from him. An hour passed. Then two. The courthouse had been open for thirty minutes when she finally cleared her throat. "Nathaniel, shouldn't we leave soon?"

He checked his watch. "Give me a moment."

Isabella bit her lip. The paperwork will happen regardless, she reassured herself. No need to rush and risk irritating him.

Nathaniel's phone buzzed discreetly against the desk. A single message sent, then returned to its place. Fifteen minutes later, Samuel burst in urgently. "Emergency board meeting, sir. They're insisting on your immediate presence."

Nathaniel stood abruptly. "Now?"

"Yes. The entire morning's schedule may need postponement."

"Handle it." Turning to Isabella, his tone softened marginally. "I'll arrange a car for you. This can't be delayed."

Before she could protest, he was gone.

By 9:10 a.m., Evelyn had been waiting outside the courthouse for ninety minutes. Her third call to Nathaniel finally connected—to Samuel's voice. "Mrs. Martin? Mr. Martin's in a critical meeting. May I assist?"

"A meeting?" Her grip tightened on the phone. "On today of all days?"

"An unforeseen crisis. Shall I relay a message?"

"No." The word dropped like lead. Hanging up, Evelyn stared at her reflection in the courthouse windows. What meeting could possibly trump this?

Her phone vibrated with Gregory's caller ID. "Is it done?" he asked without preamble.

"Not even close. He's... preoccupied."

A pause. Then, quietly: "Evelyn... is he having second thoughts?"

The morning light filtered through the curtains of Pineview Villa, casting golden patterns across our bedroom. I stirred awake to find Nathaniel already dressed, his crisp white shirt accentuating his broad shoulders as he adjusted his cufflinks by the window.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he murmured without turning, as if sensing my gaze. That name still sent a thrill through me - Evelyn Martin. Architect. Wife. Soon-to-be mother.

I stretched beneath the silk sheets. "You're up early."

"Board meeting at nine." He finally turned, his stormy gray eyes softening as they landed on my barely-there baby bump. "How's our little architect today?"

Before I could answer, my phone buzzed violently on the nightstand. Gregory's name flashed across the screen with three missed calls. My stomach dropped. Gregory never called this early unless something was wrong.

Nathaniel's brow furrowed as I grabbed the phone. "Everything alright?"

"I don't know." My fingers trembled as I dialed voicemail. Gregory's frantic voice filled the room: "Evelyn, call me immediately. Summit Realty just pulled out of the waterfront project. Sebastian Wilson is claiming breach of contract."

The phone slipped from my fingers. This couldn't be happening. Not after six months of work. Not when my reputation was finally recovering from the scandal with Isabella.

Nathaniel was beside me in two strides, scooping up the phone. "Let me handle this."

"No." I swung my legs out of bed, suddenly nauseous. "This is my project. My responsibility."

His jaw tightened. "At least let me call Samuel to-"

"I need to see the contract first." I was already pulling on clothes, my mind racing. What could have possibly gone wrong? We'd been meticulous. I'd personally reviewed every clause with Gregory last week.

Downstairs, Alfred had coffee waiting. The normally comforting aroma turned my stomach. Nathaniel's phone rang as we reached the foyer.

"It's Richard," he said grimly. Of course it was. His father had opposed my firm handling Martin Group projects from the beginning. This would be all the ammunition he needed.

I kissed Nathaniel's cheek. "Go. I'll meet you at the office after I sort this out."

The drive to Mitchell & Wilson Architects passed in a blur. Gregory was pacing outside when I arrived, his usually impeccable suit wrinkled, tie askew.

"Thank God," he breathed, pulling me inside. "Jonathan Blake just sent over their termination notice. They're citing 'failure to meet design specifications' and 'unprofessional conduct.'"

"That's impossible!" I snatched the papers from his hands, scanning the legalese. My vision blurred at Section 4.2: "Designer engaged in conflicts of interest through undisclosed relationship with competing firm."

Ice water flooded my veins. There was only one person who would plant that idea.

Isabella.

The office phone rang shrilly. Gregory answered, then paled. "It's Cassandra Reed's agent. They're withdrawing from the model home showcase."

The walls seemed to close in. Cassandra was our celebrity draw for next month's grand opening. Without her...

My phone buzzed again. Unknown number. A text with a single image loaded slowly - a grainy photo of Nathaniel leaving a hotel with Isabella last night. The timestamp read 11:37pm.

My coffee cup shattered on the floor.

Gregory grabbed my shoulders. "Evelyn? Breathe."

But I couldn't. Because the accompanying message made everything clear: "Some designs should never be built. Walk away now, or everyone sees what your husband really does at night."

The world tilted. Was this why Nathaniel had been so insistent on handling things himself? Had he been lying about cutting ties with Isabella?

My hands found my stomach protectively. I'd survived scandals before. But this time, it wasn't just my career at stake. It was my marriage. My family.

And someone was determined to burn it all down.

###Chapter 43 
Evelyn froze momentarily before shaking her head vehemently. "That's absurd. Nathaniel wants nothing to do with me. He's desperate to marry Isabella—why would he stall our divorce?"

The very suggestion was laughable.

She wasn't naive enough to believe such nonsense.

Gregory hesitated, choosing his words carefully. "Perhaps I misread the situation. But if you're certain about divorcing, delaying serves no purpose. The sooner it's done, the cleaner the break."

"You're right."

Sensing her darkening mood, Gregory softened his tone. "Evelyn, I'm not interfering. I just don't want to see you hurt."

"I know," she replied. "Didn't we agree we're friends? Friends trust each other. I'd never doubt your intentions."

"My apologies for overstepping."

"Consider it forgotten."

Their shared laughter dissolved the tension. Shifting topics, Evelyn discussed work. "Once contracts are signed, we'll commence with Summit Realty. As the Martin Group's design partner, expect brutal revisions. Our current blueprints might get scrapped entirely."

"Understood. I've prepped the team. Will you lead this solo or involve other designers?"

"I'll handle it. You coordinate with other partners. We'll finalize details after the site visit."

"Got it," Gregory murmured.

Evelyn exhaled quietly before fabricating an excuse to hang up.

She'd pursued architecture to bridge the chasm between her and Nathaniel. The Martin Group's sprawling empire included premier architectural ventures—what better way to remain relevant in his world?

She'd clawed her way to the top, believing only excellence could make him notice. Yet now, as their marriage crumbled, he remained oblivious to her professional identity.

The irony tasted bitter.

She'd never volunteer the information now.

News of Edward Martin approving the divorce reached the Mitchell household by midmorning. Victoria Martin's call to Margaret was cordial yet firm. "Though Evelyn and Nathaniel part ways, our families' friendship remains. We must keep in touch."

Margaret's grip tightened on the receiver. "Naturally," she replied icily.

"Wonderful! We should arrange a mahjong night soon—it's been ages."

"Yes, let's."

Margaret claimed urgent matters and hung up.

The phone slammed onto marble. "That insolent girl! Does she think abandoning her family absolves her from basic decency?"

William paused his departure, scowling. "Had you paid attention to your daughter, you'd have known about this impending divorce. This negligence reflects poorly on you as a mother." His glare intensified. "Fix this. That divorce cannot happen."

As he stormed out, Margaret seethed. Her precarious position in William's affections—jeopardized by infertility—couldn't withstand Evelyn's recklessness. Years of carefully maintained appearances couldn't be undone now.

Sophia offered a consoling teacup. "Mother, if their marriage is unsustainable, perhaps divorce is merciful. Prolonging the inevitable helps no one."

"Never!" Margaret's eyes gleamed with calculation. "I won't allow it."

Watching her mother's scheming expression, Sophia felt unease coil in her stomach.

Nathaniel returned to Pineview Villa at dusk.

Hearing his car, Evelyn intercepted him at the entrance. "What happened today?"

"Morning board meeting. Afternoon obligations." His tone was clipped.

"Too busy for thirty minutes?"

His jaw tightened. "Are you implying I avoided this deliberately?"

"I asked a simple question," Evelyn countered quietly. His defensiveness puzzled her.

"Let's go first thing tomorrow. Surely your corporate empire can spare half an hour?"

His expression darkened. "Fine. Tomorrow."

He brushed past her without another glance.

Dinner passed in stifling silence. Even Isabella—usually chirpy—pushed food listlessly around her plate. Evelyn noted her swollen eyes discreetly.

Crying because the divorce didn't happen today?

The thought extinguished Evelyn's curiosity. She retreated to her room post-dinner.

Seizing the moment, Isabella whispered, "Nathaniel... are you having second thoughts? Today you—"

"Isabella." His voice carried warning. "The Martin Group's stability takes precedence over everything. Would you have me jeopardize it?"

She bit her lip. All day, she'd awaited his reassurance after storming out earlier. His continued indifference unnerved her.

"I just need to know—will you really divorce her?"

Nathaniel's gaze turned inscrutable. "Yes."

Relief flooded her features. "I'd give up everything for you, darling. We'll be so happy—"

His terse nod silenced her.

Her radiant smile suddenly grated on him.

This is what you wanted. Why hesitate now?

The contradiction gnawed at him. Watching Isabella's jubilant expression, an unfamiliar resentment surfaced.

Again, he waited until Evelyn slept before entering their bedroom. This inexplicable compulsion troubled him deeply.

Dawn found Evelyn dressed and ready, documents in hand.

Nathaniel descended to find her waiting, posture impeccable, lips painted a distracting crimson.

His mood soured instantly. "Eager to sever ties, Evelyn?"

The accusation hung between them as sunlight streamed through the windows, illuminating the chasm neither could bridge.
###Chapter 44

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers hovered over the blueprint of the new Martin Group project, but her mind was elsewhere—lingering on Nathaniel's unexpected text from last night.

"We need to talk."

Three words that had kept her awake until dawn.

A sharp knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in with a frazzled expression. "Mr. Wilson is here. He says it's urgent."

Before Evelyn could respond, Gregory strode in, his usually composed demeanor replaced by visible agitation. "Turn on the news," he demanded, tossing his tablet onto her desk.

The screen flashed with a headline that made her blood run cold: "Martin Group Heir Spotted with Former Flame Isabella Davis at Elite Gala—What Does This Mean for His Marriage?"

A paparazzi photo filled the screen—Nathaniel, devastatingly handsome in a tuxedo, standing too close to Isabella near the balcony of the Grand Metropole. Her crimson gown brushed against his leg, her fingers curled around his forearm in a gesture that screamed intimacy.

Evelyn's throat tightened.

Gregory swore under his breath. "This is bad timing. The Kensington project pitch is tomorrow, and the board’s already questioning your credibility as lead architect after the—"

"I know," she cut him off, voice steadier than she felt. She closed the tab with deliberate calm. "Cancel my afternoon meetings. I need to handle this."

Nathaniel's penthouse was eerily silent when she arrived. Alfred, their butler, greeted her with a troubled look. "Madam, Mr. Martin left instructions not to be disturbed—"

"Where is he?"

"The study, but—"

She was already moving.

The door swung open to reveal Nathaniel by the fireplace, whiskey in hand, his profile carved in shadows. He turned slowly, and the raw guilt in his eyes confirmed everything.

"You saw the news," he said flatly.

Evelyn crossed her arms, nails digging into her sleeves. "Explain."

A muscle ticked in his jaw. "It wasn’t what it looked like. Isabella ambushed me—said she had information about Grandfather’s will. Next thing I knew, photographers were everywhere."

"Convenient." Her laugh was brittle. "Just like her 'accidental' calls during our honeymoon?"

Nathaniel set his glass down with a sharp clink. "I didn’t invite her, Evelyn."

"But you didn’t walk away." The words hung between them, heavy as an executioner’s axe.

His silence was answer enough.

Her phone buzzed—a notification from Caroline: "Turn on Channel 7 NOW."

On the mounted TV screen, Isabella’s tearful face filled the frame. "...I never stopped loving him," she confessed to the reporter, dabbing at mascara-streaked cheeks. "Some bonds can’t be broken, no matter who tries to come between us..."

Nathaniel cursed, grabbing the remote to mute it, but the damage was done.

Evelyn backed toward the door, her chest burning. "I’ll be at my mother’s. Don’t follow me."

"Evelyn—"

She slammed the door before he could finish, her wedding ring catching the light as she hailed a cab—a golden band that suddenly felt like a shackle.

At Margaret’s brownstone, Evelyn collapsed onto the couch, her composure crumbling. Her mother handed her chamomile tea laced with honey—just like she’d done after childhood scrapes.

"Front-page drama aside," Margaret said gently, "what do you want?"

Evelyn stared into her cup. That was the problem—she wasn’t sure anymore.

Then her phone lit up with a call from an unknown number.

Isabella’s saccharine voice dripped through the speaker: "Let’s settle this like adults, darling. Meet me at the Regent Lounge—unless you’re scared?"

The line went dead.

Evelyn’s fingers clenched around her phone. Oh, this witch had crossed a line.

She stood abruptly, tea forgotten. "Mom, I need your pearl earrings."

Margaret raised an eyebrow. "The ones your grandmother gave me?"

"The very same." Evelyn’s smile was all sharp edges. "Time to remind certain people why they shouldn’t underestimate a Mitchell woman."

Hearing Nathaniel's voice, Evelyn instinctively lifted her gaze, meeting his icy, penetrating stare.

Displeasure was etched across his features. Evelyn frowned slightly. "I wasn't impatient. I just didn’t want to waste your time, so I got ready early and waited here."

Isn’t this better? she thought. Now he can be with Isabella openly without delay.

She didn’t understand why he was angry.

But she held back her questions, simply watching him in silence.

Nathaniel’s glare darkened, his irritation palpable. Just then, Isabella descended the stairs, her voice soft as she called, "Nathaniel."

"Yes?" He turned away from Evelyn, his tone shifting instantly.

Isabella continued, "Are you going to finalize the paperwork later?"

Evelyn ignored her, pretending not to hear. It wasn’t as if the question was directed at her anyway.

Nathaniel answered indifferently, "Yes."

Short. Clipped.

Evelyn assumed he was in a foul mood—after all, even his beloved Isabella was receiving this cold treatment.

Best to stay quiet.

Isabella brightened. "Nathaniel, shall we have dinner out tonight?"

He didn’t refuse. "If nothing comes up, I’ll have Samuel pick you up. Sound good?"

"Perfect." She smiled, nodding.

Evelyn suddenly felt like an intruder, awkward and out of place.

Thankfully, Alfred arrived to announce breakfast.

Half an hour later, after they finished eating, Nathaniel left first and got into the car. Evelyn gathered her documents and hurried after him.

They sat side by side in silence. Just as the car was about to move, Isabella approached again, leaning in through the open window.

"Nathaniel, Evelyn," she began, her voice sweet, "congratulations on your newfound freedom. Evelyn, I appreciate you taking care of Nathaniel for me this past year. Maybe we can be friends?"

Evelyn’s expression remained blank as she met Isabella’s gaze. "Ms. Davis, do you often befriend your fiancé’s ex-wife? I’m afraid I have no interest in being friends with my ex-husband’s future wife."

Isabella’s smile didn’t waver. "You’re overthinking it. You and Nathaniel never loved each other—it was just an arrangement for your families. After the divorce, we could even become close. Besides, Nathaniel will still look out for you. Once we’re married, I’ll consider it my duty too."

Evelyn’s lips thinned. "Sorry, but I’m no saint. Do as you please, Ms. Davis."

With that, she rolled up the window, cutting off Isabella’s voice mid-sentence.

She turned to Nathaniel. "Let’s go."

Nathaniel had stayed silent during the exchange. Now, as he started the car, he shot her a glance. "Isabella wasn’t trying to provoke you. Why the hostility?"

"I was just stating facts."

"What facts?"

Evelyn exhaled. "Nathaniel, after the divorce, I don’t think we—or Isabella and I—should stay in contact. It’s better if we become strangers. Cleaner for everyone."

Most importantly, she couldn’t bear to watch the man she loved with someone else.

A proper ex-wife shouldn’t linger in her ex-husband’s life.

Nathaniel didn’t respond. Just then, her phone rang.

Seeing the caller ID, her stomach twisted. She declined the call immediately.

Nathaniel noticed. "Not answering?"

"Not important."

She turned to the window.

It was Margaret. Evelyn knew exactly why she was calling.

And she had no intention of entertaining it.

But the phone rang again. Without hesitation, Evelyn powered it off.

Everything could wait until after the divorce was finalized.

Nathaniel’s voice cut through the silence. "Who was it?"

"My mother."

"Why ignore her?"

Evelyn kept her tone even. "She doesn’t want us to divorce. Answering won’t change anything."

Nathaniel’s gaze sharpened. "Your relationship with the Mitchells isn’t as perfect as it seems, is it?"

"More or less. Doesn’t matter."

She didn’t elaborate. In their year of marriage, he’d never once asked about her family. Now that they were ending things, it was irrelevant.

Nathaniel sensed her withdrawal. His jaw tightened before he spoke again. "Your parents oppose the divorce. How will you explain it to them?"

"I’m an adult. I make my own decisions. You don’t need to worry about it."

Her voice was calm, detached.

But to Nathaniel, it sounded like deliberate distance. His expression darkened, the air between them turning frigid.

Silence settled over them.

Soon, the car pulled up outside the courthouse.

One step through those doors, and everything between them would be erased.

Neither spoke. The quiet was so heavy Evelyn could hear her own heartbeat.

Finally, she broke it. "Nathaniel, let’s go in."

"Fine."

She reached for the door handle—

Then Nathaniel’s phone rang.

He answered tersely. "What?"

Evelyn couldn’t hear the other side, but Nathaniel’s posture stiffened. His frown deepened before he ended the call abruptly.

"Isabella’s unwell. I need to go to the hospital. Coming?"

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her papers. "Can’t we finish this first?"

"Evelyn," he snapped, "when Isabella is sick, it’s life-threatening. Compared to that, the divorce can wait."

Without waiting for her reply, he slammed the accelerator.

The car lurched forward. Evelyn, who’d already unbuckled, scrambled to fasten her seatbelt again.

From the corner of her eye, she saw Nathaniel’s stormy expression.

Of course, she thought bitterly. Postponing our divorce for her is nothing. After all, she’s more important.

She stayed silent the entire drive.

When they arrived, she didn’t move. "I’ll wait here."

"Suit yourself."

Nathaniel barely glanced at her before striding into the hospital, his urgency unmistakable.

The sight made her chest ache.

Minutes ticked by. Nathaniel didn’t return.

Evelyn sighed.

Must be serious.
###Chapter 45

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers hovered over the blueprints, but her mind was elsewhere—Nathaniel's unexpected call last night still echoed in her thoughts.

"Evelyn?" Gabrielle's voice broke her reverie. "Mr. Wilson is waiting in Conference Room B. He said it's urgent."

She straightened, smoothing her blazer. "Tell him I'll be right there."

Gregory Wilson stood by the window, his expression unreadable. "We have a problem," he said without preamble. "Summit Realty just pulled out of the Riverside project."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. "What? The contracts were signed last week!"

"Sebastian Wilson claims financing issues." Gregory's jaw tightened. "But I heard through the grapevine that Isabella Davis paid him a visit yesterday."

The name sent a chill down Evelyn's spine. Isabella—Nathaniel's ex, the woman who'd haunted their relationship from the start.

Her phone buzzed. A text from Nathaniel: We need to talk. Tonight. 8 PM at the penthouse.

The formal tone was unlike him. Evelyn's fingers trembled as she typed a reply, but Gabrielle burst in before she could send it.

"Breaking news!" Her assistant thrust a tablet forward. A gossip site displayed a grainy photo of Nathaniel leaving a luxury hotel with Isabella at 2 AM. The headline screamed: Martin Heir Rekindles Old Flame!

Evelyn's vision blurred. This couldn't be happening. Not after everything they'd—

"Evelyn?" Gregory gripped her shoulder. "Breathe. We'll handle this."

She numbly scrolled through the article. Quotes from "an insider" described Nathaniel's supposed regrets about their rushed marriage. The timestamp showed the photos were taken the same night he'd canceled their anniversary dinner, claiming a business emergency.

Her phone rang. Unknown number.

"Hello?" Evelyn barely recognized her own voice.

"Did you really think you could keep him?" Isabella's honeyed tones dripped venom. "Nathaniel always comes back to me. Always."

Click.

The world tilted. Evelyn gripped the table edge as Gregory swore under his breath.

"We're not done here," she whispered, fingers curling into fists. "Not by a long shot."

Somewhere in the building, an elevator pinged. Footsteps approached—fast. The door flew open to reveal Nathaniel, his usually impeccable tie loosened, eyes wild.

"Evelyn, it's not what it—"

She held up a silencing hand, the diamond wedding band catching the light. "Save it. I have a company to save." Turning to Gregory, she said coolly, "Call Jonathan Blake at Summit. Tell him we're invoking Clause 12B."

Nathaniel's face paled. "You can't—"

"Oh, I can." Evelyn met his gaze, her voice steady despite the hurricane inside. "And you're going to help me."

The clock on the wall ticked loudly in the sudden silence. Somewhere outside, a car horn blared. The game had changed.

And Evelyn Mitchell never lost.

The morning dragged on endlessly. By the time the courthouse staff had left for the day, Evelyn still sat in the car, waiting. Finally, Nathaniel arrived.

Samuel stepped forward. "Mrs. Martin, Mr. Martin needs to stay at the hospital with Ms. Davis. I’ll take you home."

"How is Isabella?"

"She’s stable. It was just a food allergy—her heart rate spiked, but the medication has it under control now."

"I see."

Samuel drove in silence. Evelyn clenched her fists, irritation simmering beneath her skin. If Isabella was fine, why couldn’t Nathaniel spare one hour to finalize their divorce?

Nothing ever took precedence over her.

When Evelyn returned to Pineview Villa, the staff looked uneasy. She turned to Alfred. "What caused Ms. Davis’s allergy?"

"Almonds. The chef overlooked it. But don’t worry, Evelyn."

She frowned. If Isabella is allergic to almonds, Nathaniel would’ve warned the staff. How did this happen?

Something felt off.

In the hospital, Isabella reclined against the pillows, an IV drip in her arm. The red splotches on her skin had faded, but her gaze remained fixed on Nathaniel, who sat nearby, typing on his laptop.

He’d stayed with her all day. The thought warmed her.

He still cares about me the most.

"Nathaniel," she murmured, "I’m fine now. If you have work, you should go."

"I’ll take you home after the IV." His voice was gentle.

"You’re too good to me." She smiled, the kind only a woman in love could.

His eyes met hers. "Your happiness matters."

Isabella hesitated. "Nathaniel… did you and Evelyn finish the paperwork?"

She’d wanted to ask earlier, but doctors and nurses had been in and out. Now, she held her breath, waiting for his confirmation.

Instead, silence stretched between them.

"Nathaniel?"

"It didn’t happen," he finally said.

Her pulse jumped. "Why not?"

"We were at the courthouse when Alfred called. You’d been hospitalized."

Her stomach twisted. Relief and frustration warred inside her. "I’m sorry. If I hadn’t—"

"It’s fine. The divorce can wait. Your health can’t."

She nodded, but unease settled in her chest.

If I hadn’t gotten sick… would he have gone through with it?

And then another thought: Alfred said the soup I ate was prepared under Nathaniel’s instructions. I barely had anything else. How did almonds end up in it?

The more she thought, the less she understood him.

At Martin Manor, Edward had already heard the news.

He said nothing, eyes closed as opera music played softly.

Victoria muttered, "Is Nathaniel bewitched by that woman? I need to meet her."

No one noticed the faint smirk on Edward’s lips.

That night, Nathaniel returned to their bedroom.

Evelyn was waiting. "Is Isabella alright?"

"A minor allergy. Nothing serious."

"Good." She took a breath. "Can we finalize the divorce tomorrow?"

His expression darkened. "I’m busy."

"Thirty minutes. That’s all it takes."

"No."

She stiffened. "The Martin Group won’t collapse if you step away for half an hour."

"Evelyn." His voice turned icy. "I have responsibilities. People depend on me. I won’t neglect them for personal matters."

Her nails dug into her palms. "Then when will you be free?"

"Not anytime soon."

Her chest tightened. "You had time to spend all morning with Isabella, but not thirty minutes for this?"

His gaze turned lethal. "You think you can compare yourself to her?"

The words struck like a slap.

Evelyn inhaled sharply. Of course. I mean nothing to him.

Nathaniel stepped closer. "Why the rush? Eager to run to Gregory?"

She lifted her chin. "Yes. So why delay?"

His jaw clenched. "You’re pushing your luck."

"You do as you please. Why can’t I?"

His hand shot out, gripping her chin. "You want to be with him?"

She didn’t flinch. "Why shouldn’t I? You’re marrying Isabella, aren’t you?"

A cold laugh escaped him. "You forget your place. In this marriage, I decide. Not you."

"We’re getting divorced. What does it matter?"

His grip tightened. "You’ll regret this."

She met his glare, unyielding.

Let him be angry. He doesn’t own me anymore.
###Chapter 46

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains as Evelyn stretched beneath the silk sheets. Nathaniel's side of the bed was already cold - he'd left for his early meeting without waking her again. She traced the empty space with her fingertips, the satin fabric cool against her skin.

Her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. Gabrielle's name flashed across the screen with three missed calls. Evelyn's stomach clenched as she reached for it.

"Evelyn, thank God!" Gabrielle's voice came through in a rushed whisper. "You need to get to the office now. Gregory's been trying to reach you for an hour. There's... there's been a situation with the Montclair project."

Evelyn was already out of bed, pulling on her robe. "What kind of situation?"

"The kind with police tape and news vans," Gabrielle said. "Someone leaked those structural reports to the press. The ones with the... discrepancies."

Ice flooded Evelyn's veins. She could hear the panic in her assistant's voice, could picture the chaos unfolding at Mitchell & Wilson Architects. The Montclair project was their biggest contract this year - Nathaniel had personally recommended them for it.

She dressed in record time, her fingers fumbling with the buttons on her blouse. The elevator ride down to the garage seemed to take hours. When her phone rang again, she expected it to be Gregory or Gabrielle. The name Isabella Davis flashing on the screen made her breath catch.

"Evelyn, darling," Isabella's smooth voice purred through the phone. "I do hope you're having a lovely morning. Though I suspect it's about to become... complicated."

Evelyn's grip tightened on the steering wheel as she pulled out of the garage. "What do you want, Isabella?"

"Just thought you should know," Isabella continued, her tone dripping with false concern, "those reports didn't leak themselves. And when Nathaniel finds out who really tampered with the structural calculations... well, let's just say it won't be me he blames this time."

The call disconnected before Evelyn could respond. The city streets blurred past as she pressed harder on the accelerator, her mind racing. She'd checked those calculations herself. Double-checked them. There couldn't be mistakes. Unless...

Her phone buzzed again - a text from an unknown number. The attached photo showed a document with her signature on altered figures. Except she'd never seen this version before. The signature looked real. The numbers were dangerously wrong.

And the timestamp showed the changes were made last night - while she'd been alone in the office working late.

Evelyn's blood ran cold. Someone had set her up. And with the police already at the site, she had maybe an hour to prove it before the scandal reached Nathaniel's ears. Before everything she'd built came crashing down.

Nathaniel's grip on Evelyn's chin tightened, his voice dripping with venom. "You claim you're just friends with Gregory. What's this then?"

"People change," Evelyn retorted, meeting his furious gaze without flinching.

His fingers dug deeper, the threat unspoken but clear. She didn't resist, her indifference only fueling his rage. With a rough shove, he threw her onto the bed, pinning her beneath him.

His breath was hot against her ear, his voice a dangerous whisper. "You're my wife, Evelyn. Yet you care more about another man. Do you think I won't make you regret this?"

Her hands instinctively cradled her abdomen, her body stiffening in refusal. The rejection sent a fresh wave of fury through him.

"Tell me the truth," he demanded, his icy stare boring into her.

Evelyn exhaled shakily. "I am telling you the truth."

"Truth?" Nathaniel scoffed. "So you're admitting you love him?"

She turned her face away.

"Answer me!"

"If that's what you want to believe, then fine. Assume whatever you like."

He didn’t let her finish. His mouth crashed onto hers, punishing and possessive. It wasn’t a kiss—it was a brand, a claim meant to hurt.

Evelyn fought, twisting beneath him, but her struggles only spurred him on. Within moments, her clothes were in disarray, her hair tangled. She shoved at his shoulders, her nails scraping skin, but he didn’t relent.

"Nathaniel, stop!" Her voice broke into a sob.

All she could think was the baby—still so fragile, still in danger. She couldn’t let this happen. Not now. Not like this.

But resistance was futile.

"I hate you," she choked out, her throat raw from screaming.

Outside, Mayby’s temperamental skies split open. Thunder roared, rain hammering the windows like an omen.

When it was over, Evelyn lay motionless, every inch of her body aching. A sharp, tearing pain pulsed low in her abdomen, growing worse by the second.

Gritting her teeth, she dragged herself to the bathroom. Under the scalding spray of the shower, she tried to wash away the violation.

Then she saw it.

Blood.

Bright, terrifying streaks running down her legs.

Her breath seized.

"Nathaniel!"

The door burst open. He caught her just as her knees gave out, her vision swimming. The last thing she heard was his frantic shout for the car.

The hospital lights were blinding.

Evelyn surfaced from unconsciousness to the sterile scent of antiseptic. Her hand flew to her stomach before her eyes were fully open.

"Don’t move," Nathaniel ordered, pressing her back down.

"I need the doctor," she insisted, her voice thin with panic.

"You’re fine. Just rest."

"No—get the doctor now!"

His jaw clenched, but he relented.

When the physician arrived, Evelyn searched his face desperately. "Am I...?"

The doctor gave a nearly imperceptible nod. "You’ll be alright. Caroline briefed us. Just focus on recovering."

Relief flooded her. She sank back, hands resting protectively over her womb.

Stay with me, little one. I won’t let anything hurt you again.

Nathaniel hovered, his expression unreadable. "You should eat."

She turned her face to the wall.

"About last night—"

"Leave," she whispered. "Just leave."

Dawn crept in, pale and uneasy.

Caroline found Nathaniel in the hallway, his usually impeccable appearance disheveled.

"If you can’t love her," she said quietly, "let her go."

He said nothing.

Evelyn’s fingers curled into the sheets, her silent vow echoing in the stillness.

This child will survive. No matter what.
###Chapter 47

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. The warmth of Nathaniel’s arm draped over her waist was a comforting weight, grounding her in the moment. She turned slightly, studying his peaceful expression—the way his dark lashes fanned against his cheeks, the faint stubble shadowing his jaw.

A soft knock at the door interrupted the quiet.

"Mrs. Martin?" Alfred’s voice was muffled through the wood. "Mr. Edward has requested your presence in the study."

Evelyn frowned. Edward rarely summoned her directly unless it was urgent. She carefully extricated herself from Nathaniel’s embrace, pressing a featherlight kiss to his temple before slipping out of bed.

Downstairs, the study door was slightly ajar. Edward sat behind his mahogany desk, his sharp gaze fixed on a document in front of him. Winston stood nearby, his usual composed demeanor tinged with something Evelyn couldn’t quite place—unease?

"You wanted to see me?" she asked, stepping inside.

Edward looked up, his expression unreadable. "Evelyn. Sit."

She obeyed, smoothing her silk robe over her knees. The air in the room felt heavy, charged with tension.

"I’ve received some… concerning news," Edward began, folding his hands. "Regarding Isabella Davis."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Isabella—Nathaniel’s ex, the woman who had once held his heart and still seemed to linger in the shadows of their marriage.

"What about her?" Evelyn kept her voice steady, though her fingers tightened imperceptibly on the armrest.

Edward exhaled slowly. "She’s back in the city. And she’s been in contact with certain individuals who have vested interests in destabilizing the Martins."

A cold knot formed in Evelyn’s stomach. "What does that mean?"

"It means," Winston interjected quietly, "that she may not be here for reconciliation."

Edward’s gaze bore into Evelyn’s. "I need you to be cautious. Nathaniel has a history with her, and emotions can cloud judgment."

Evelyn swallowed hard. She had fought too hard for her place in Nathaniel’s life to let Isabella waltz back in and unravel everything.

"I understand," she said, lifting her chin. "But I trust Nathaniel."

Edward’s lips thinned. "Trust is a luxury, Evelyn. One we can’t always afford."

Just then, the study door swung open. Nathaniel stood there, his shirt rumpled from sleep, his eyes dark with concern.

"What’s going on?" he demanded, his gaze flicking between Evelyn and his grandfather.

Silence stretched for a heartbeat too long.

Then Edward leaned back in his chair. "We were just discussing an old ghost."

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched. "Isabella."

Evelyn watched as recognition—and something else, something guarded—flashed across his face.

The game had just changed. And none of them were ready for what came next.

"I'll stay right here with you. I won't disturb you. I'll be quiet, I promise."

Nathaniel reached out to tuck a loose strand of hair behind Evelyn's ear, but before his fingers could graze her skin, she flinched away. His hand froze mid-air, then dropped stiffly to his side.

Evelyn's face was pale, her lips bloodless. Her eyes, once warm, had turned icy.

Nathaniel clenched his fist before releasing it with a quiet sigh. He adjusted the hospital bed for her, then lifted the bowl of broth. "Let me feed you. Just a little, okay?"

The broth was barely seasoned—just a pinch of salt—since Evelyn couldn't stomach anything heavier.

But she turned her head away. "I'm not hungry."

"What would you like instead? I'll have it prepared."

"Nothing. Just leave."

"Evelyn," he murmured, voice softening, "I crossed a line last night. It won't happen again."

"So you push me first, then try to soothe me?" Her voice trembled. "Nathaniel, do you even realize what you almost—"

She cut herself off, pressing a hand to her stomach. The thought of last night made her chest tighten. She had told him to stop. Begged him. But he hadn’t listened. If anything had happened to the baby because of it...

She’d never forgive him. Or herself.

Nathaniel didn’t lower the bowl. His voice was low, rough with regret. "Punish me however you want. But you need to eat. How else will you recover?"

"Put it down. I'll manage."

She turned her back to him, shutting him out.

Evelyn didn’t understand him.

They were supposed to be finalizing their divorce. Yet he’d treated her like a lover last night.

And now? Now he hovered over her like a devoted husband.

What game was he playing?

The more she thought about it, the angrier she grew.

After that, she ignored him completely. No matter what he said or did, silence was her only response.

News of Evelyn’s hospitalization reached the Martins by dawn.

Edward arrived with Victoria, both horrified by Evelyn’s gaunt appearance. They wasted no time berating Nathaniel.

"Evelyn," Edward said, patting her hand, "once you’re better, I’ll personally take you to file those divorce papers. Then you’ll move back into the manor. From now on, you’re my granddaughter." His eyes twinkled. "A beauty like you? Half the eligible bachelors in the city will be lining up. We’ll vet them properly."

Evelyn managed a weak smile. Just one night, and her cheeks had hollowed.

Nathaniel stood in the corner, jaw tight. He didn’t dare argue.

Two days passed. Nathaniel stayed by her side the entire time, though Evelyn remained frosty. He didn’t push. He let her set the pace.

Isabella visited once. Evelyn refused to see her. Nathaniel finally sent her away.

On discharge day, Edward sent a car. Nathaniel followed, assuming it was just a family dinner.

He was wrong.

Edward had arranged a matchmaking session.

Victoria had prepared dossiers on every respectable bachelor in their circle. Edward handed them to Evelyn one by one. "Take your time, dear. No rush. Just point out who catches your eye."

Evelyn was overwhelmed but couldn’t refuse his kindness. She forced herself to skim the profiles.

She paused at one. "This one seems nice. How old is he?"

"Ah! Theodore Gene. The Genes are a medical dynasty—brilliant lineage. He’s a year younger than you."

"A year younger?" Evelyn shook her head. "That won’t work."

"Nonsense! Age gaps are fashionable now. I’ll arrange a meeting tomorrow."

Evelyn stayed silent.

Victoria beamed. "Theodore’s mature for his age. His mother says he’s exceptionally considerate. You’ll adore him."

"Alright," Evelyn conceded.

"Shall I come with you?" Victoria asked.

"If you don’t mind. First meetings are... awkward."

Victoria clasped her hands. "Oh, Evelyn! Thank you for letting me experience planning a daughter’s wedding."

Evelyn’s cheeks pinked.

The room was warm with laughter.

Across from them, Richard shot Nathaniel a pointed look. "Your grandfather isn’t joking. For Evelyn’s sake, finalize the divorce soon."

Nathaniel’s expression didn’t flicker. "The Martin Group is at a critical juncture. Our stocks would plummet if news of the divorce broke now. I’ll wait until the current project stabilizes."

His tone was smooth, betraying nothing.

"Is that truly your reason?" Richard pressed.

"Of course. As CEO, the company comes first. Personal matters can’t jeopardize its interests."

Richard studied him. "If it’s for the company, explain that to your grandfather. Before things escalate."

Their gazes locked—a silent understanding passing between them.

Nathaniel re-entered the sitting room just as Edward declared, "Evelyn’s kind and stunning. Any man would be lucky to have her!"

Evelyn, embarrassed, played along. "You’re too kind."

Nathaniel froze in the doorway.

Their eyes met. Evelyn quickly looked away.

Edward waved him over. "Perfect timing. What do you think of this candidate?"

Nathaniel glanced at the photo. A notorious playboy.

Without a word, he snatched it and tossed it into the trash.

Edward’s face darkened. "Nathaniel!"

The room went silent.
###Chapter 48

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn’s office, casting golden streaks across her drafting table. She exhaled sharply, rubbing her temples as she stared at the blueprint in front of her. The design for the new Martin Group project was due by the end of the week, and yet, her mind kept drifting elsewhere.

Nathaniel had been distant lately.

Ever since their last argument—something trivial about his late-night meetings—he had withdrawn into himself, his smiles forced, his touches fleeting. She knew he was under pressure, but the silence between them was suffocating.

A knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

"Evelyn?" Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in, holding a steaming cup of coffee. "Thought you might need this."

Evelyn smiled gratefully, accepting the cup. "You’re a lifesaver."

Gabrielle hesitated, then leaned against the doorframe. "You okay? You’ve been staring at that blueprint for an hour."

Evelyn sighed, setting the coffee down. "Just… distracted."

"Because of Nathaniel?"

She didn’t answer, but the way her fingers tightened around the cup was answer enough.

Gabrielle bit her lip. "You know, sometimes men just need space to sort things out. Especially ones like him."

Evelyn scoffed. "Space is one thing. Silence is another."

Before Gabrielle could respond, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel lit up the screen:

"Dinner tonight. We need to talk."

Her stomach twisted. Those four words never meant anything good.

Nathaniel stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows of his penthouse, watching the city lights flicker to life as dusk settled. His fingers drummed restlessly against the glass.

He hated this. Hated the tension, the unspoken words, the way Evelyn’s eyes had dimmed every time he walked into a room lately.

But he couldn’t avoid it anymore.

The door clicked open behind him.

Evelyn stepped inside, her heels silent against the marble floor. She looked stunning—always did—but there was a wariness in her gaze now.

"You wanted to talk," she said, voice steady.

Nathaniel turned, meeting her eyes. "Yeah."

A beat of silence. Then, he exhaled. "I’ve been an ass."

Evelyn blinked. That wasn’t what she’d expected.

He ran a hand through his hair, frustration bleeding into his voice. "I’ve been pushing you away because I didn’t want to drag you into my mess. But that’s not fair to you."

Her pulse quickened. "What mess?"

Nathaniel hesitated. Then, quietly: "Isabella’s back in town."

The name hit Evelyn like a physical blow. Isabella—his first love, the woman who had shattered his heart years ago.

And now she was here.

Evelyn’s fingers curled into fists at her sides. "And?"

Nathaniel stepped closer, his gaze intense. "And I need you to know that nothing’s changed. Not for me."

But the doubt was already there, creeping in like poison.

Because if Isabella was back…

What did that mean for them?

Nathaniel's voice was hushed but firm as he addressed his grandfather. "Grandfather, Evelyn and I are still legally married. If word gets out about this situation, it won’t just tarnish my reputation—it will reflect poorly on the entire Martin family."

"Are you attempting to intimidate me?" Edward Martin's piercing gaze bore into him.

"I'm merely stating facts." Nathaniel exhaled, his expression tight with frustration.

Edward's lips thinned. "You think the Martin name is so fragile that gossip could break it?"

"You're right, Grandfather. But rumors spread like wildfire, especially now that the Martin Group’s new venture has just launched. Competitors are watching, the government is scrutinizing, and one misstep could cost us everything. We can’t afford distractions."

Nathaniel’s tone was measured, his reasoning sound. This wasn’t about personal feelings—it was about business.

Richard Martin, Nathaniel’s father, nodded in agreement. "Father, he has a point. The Martin Group may appear untouchable, but we can’t ignore potential risks."

Edward fell silent, his sharp eyes flickering toward Evelyn.

Evelyn remained composed, her voice steady. "Our marriage was never public knowledge. Divorcing now wouldn’t affect the Martin Group. And I have no interest in your shares, so there’s no financial impact."

Her logic was flawless, her tone detached.

The room grew still. Evelyn lifted her gaze, meeting Nathaniel’s icy stare.

He countered, "Secrets have a way of surfacing. Even if we keep it quiet, can you guarantee the Mitchells won’t leak it? You said yourself they oppose the divorce. Do you really believe they’ll stay silent?"

Would her family side with her?

No.

Margaret Mitchell would never allow Evelyn to sever ties with the Martins.

Evelyn’s shoulders tensed. She had no rebuttal.

Nathaniel pressed on, "Since you can’t promise discretion, I won’t gamble the company’s stability."

His phone buzzed abruptly, cutting through the tension.

Nathaniel glanced at the screen. "I have to take this. It’s about the project." He turned to Evelyn. "Stay and talk with Grandfather. I’ll come back for you."

Without waiting for her response, he bid Edward farewell and strode out.

Evelyn clenched her fists. In mere minutes, her plans had unraveled.

She knew Nathaniel wasn’t delaying the divorce for her. It was always about the Martins.

Edward leaned closer, his voice gentle. "Evelyn, don’t let Nathaniel dictate this. If you want the divorce, I’ll support you. His reasons don’t matter—only your choice does."

"Thank you, Grandfather." She forced a smile. As much as she wanted freedom, she wouldn’t jeopardize the Martin Group.

She inhaled deeply. "If Nathaniel insists on waiting, then we’ll wait."

Today, it was the company. Tomorrow, it would be Isabella.

Evelyn might as well use this time to finish her own projects.

Instead of lingering at the manor, she had Alfred drive her back to Pineview Villa.

Edward walked her to the car, his parting words lingering in the air. "Evelyn, if during this delay, you find that Nathaniel has changed—if you believe you could build a life together—give him a chance. Give your child a complete family. But only if it’s what you want."

His words haunted her all the way home.

Would I ever say yes?

Would Nathaniel even want that?

Exhaustion weighed on her. Two days in the hospital had left her pale but no less striking. Her delicate features were flawless, her skin luminous even without makeup.

She slipped into soft slippers and headed upstairs—only to freeze when Isabella appeared in the hallway.

"Where’s Nathaniel?" Isabella demanded, her voice sharp. "You’re keeping him from me, aren’t you? After everything I’ve sacrificed for him, how dare you?"

Evelyn instinctively shielded her abdomen, her strength waning.

She met Isabella’s glare with icy calm. "If you want him, call him. Don’t expect me to thank you for whatever you’ve done."

Isabella’s eyes flashed. "We’re both women. You know he doesn’t love you. Why cling to this marriage?"

"You’re mistaken. He’s the one refusing the divorce. Ask him yourself."

Evelyn smirked and brushed past her.

The news hit Isabella like a slap. She immediately dialed Nathaniel.

"Nathaniel, Evelyn said you’re not divorcing. Tell me she’s lying!"

"She’s not. We’re postponing it."

"Why?" Isabella’s voice cracked. "You promised me!"

"It’s temporary. The Martin Group’s project takes priority."

His indifference sent her spiraling. "You’re falling for her, aren’t you? After everything I’ve done for you—"

"Nathaniel’s tone remained cool. "This isn’t about feelings. It’s business."

But Isabella wasn’t listening. "You love her now, don’t you?"

The line went dead.

Evelyn, meanwhile, shut her bedroom door, blocking out the chaos.

For now, the marriage stood.

But for how long?
###Chapter 49

The morning sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers hovered over the architectural blueprints as her mind replayed last night's confrontation with Nathaniel. The memory of his stormy expression made her pencil tremble slightly against the paper.

Gabrielle knocked lightly before entering, her arms laden with coffee and documents. "You look like you didn't sleep at all," she observed, setting down the steaming cup. "The Carter project revisions came in. They want the north wing completely redesigned by Friday."

Evelyn groaned, rubbing her temples. "That's impossible. We'd need at least two weeks for proper structural analysis." She reached for the coffee, the bitter taste mirroring her mood. The sudden vibration of her phone made her jump. Nathaniel's name flashed on the screen.

Her assistant raised an eyebrow. "Trouble in paradise?"

Ignoring the comment, Evelyn swiped to answer. Nathaniel's deep voice came through, unusually strained. "We need to talk. Tonight. At the penthouse."

Before she could respond, the line went dead. The abruptness sent a chill down her spine. Their argument last night had been explosive, but this felt different - more final.

Gabrielle cleared her throat. "Gregory wants to see you in Conference Room B. Something about the Martin Group's new waterfront development."

Evelyn's stomach twisted. Of course it would be about Nathaniel's family business. It seemed she couldn't escape him, even professionally. Gathering her composure, she stood, smoothing her pencil skirt. "Tell him I'll be right there."

As she walked down the corridor, her phone buzzed again. This time, it was an unfamiliar number. The message contained only two words: "He knows." Her breath caught. Knows what? About her secret meetings with Edward Martin? About the documents she'd copied from Nathaniel's study?

The conference room door loomed ahead like a gateway to another battlefront. Evelyn squared her shoulders, pushing aside her personal turmoil. Whatever storm was coming tonight, she'd face it head on. But first, she had a company to run and a facade to maintain.

Little did she know, Nathaniel had already set things in motion that would change everything between them. The game was afoot, and the stakes had never been higher.

"Nathaniel, you're my everything. If even you don't want me anymore, I might as well not exist."

Isabella's voice grew fainter with each word. Before Nathaniel could respond, she ended the call abruptly. The tires of her Porsche screeched as she sped away from Pineview Villa, determined to confront him at Martin Manor.

Nathaniel assumed she needed space. He'd explain everything when he returned home that night.

But Isabella never came back.

His calls went unanswered. When Nathaniel contacted Vanessa, she claimed not to have seen Isabella either.

A storm had been raging over Mayby for days. At 10:23 PM, rain lashed against the windows like liquid nails. Nathaniel's jaw tightened as he dialed Samuel. "Pull up today's security footage. Find out where Isabella went after leaving Pineview."

"On it, sir," Samuel responded instantly.

Thirty minutes later, the report came in: surveillance showed Isabella driving aimlessly before stopping at a bar. Later, she'd taken the wrong turn toward Martin Manor, disappearing into an unmonitored mountain pass as the storm worsened.

Nathaniel's knuckles whitened around his phone. "Organize search teams. Contact the police."

"Yes, sir."

The bedroom door creaked open as Evelyn emerged from the shower, towel-drying her hair. Their eyes met.

"Isabella's missing," he stated flatly.

Evelyn remained silent.

"You shouldn't have told her those things today." His voice was glacier-cold. "That was my responsibility."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "So now her disappearance is my fault?"

"I'm not blaming you. But your words sent her driving drunk into a storm." He grabbed his leather jacket, pausing at the doorway. "She could be dead in a ditch right now because of this."

The slam of the front door echoed through Pineview. From her window, Evelyn watched his Audi vanish into the downpour.

Nathaniel met Samuel at the search headquarters. Rain hammered the windshield as his car sliced through midnight roads. A fork of blue lightning illuminated the valley—then darkness swallowed everything again.

Upstairs, Evelyn flinched at the thunderclap. She despised Isabella, but no one deserved to disappear in this weather. Not even her.

Nathaniel's expression haunted her—that icy disapproval when he'd said she shouldn't have revealed their marriage would continue. He hadn't raised his voice. He never did. But the way his eyes frosted over...

For Isabella, he'd brave a hurricane. That truth cut deeper than any argument.

Another lightning strike. Evelyn's stomach twisted with foreboding.

The phone jolted her awake at 3:17 AM. An unknown number.

"Mrs. Martin?" Samuel's voice crackled through static. "You need to come to St. Mary's. Mr. Martin's been in an accident—he's in surgery—"

The world tilted. "What... happened?"

"Head-on collision on Ridge Pass Road—"

The phone slipped from her fingers. Evelyn dressed mechanically, her reflection in the mirror ghost-pale. The roads were rivers of ink as she drove, windshield wipers fighting a losing battle against the storm.

Please let him be alive.

Dawn bled through the hospital windows when she arrived. The OR doors hissed open.

"Multiple fractures, severe lacerations, but stable," the surgeon reported. "He'll need observation when the anesthesia wears off."

Evelyn's knees buckled with relief.

The private suite smelled of antiseptic and rain. Nathaniel lay motionless, face mottled with bruises. All for a woman who'd never loved him the way Evelyn did.

Samuel handed her water. "You should rest, Mrs. Martin."

"I'm fine."

The lie tasted bitter. Outside, the storm had passed, leaving behind a bruised sunrise. Samuel brought breakfast she couldn't stomach.

Evelyn studied Nathaniel's still form. Soon he'd wake—to what? More lies? More pain?

"Where's Isabella?" she finally asked Samuel.

The silence stretched too long.

Samuel's phone buzzed. His face drained of color. "They found her car... at the bottom of Blackridge Gorge."
###Chapter 50

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

She sighed, pushing herself up. The silk sheets slipped from her shoulders as she reached for her phone. Three missed calls from Gregory. Her stomach tightened. This couldn't be good.

"Evelyn, finally!" Gregory's voice crackled through the line the moment she called back. "We have a problem. Summit Realty just pulled out of the Riverside project. Sebastian Wilson claims we breached contract terms."

Her breath hitched. "What? That's impossible. We followed every specification—"

"Doesn't matter. Their legal team is already moving forward. We need you at the office. Now."

The shower spray did little to wash away the tension coiling in her shoulders. As she dressed, her phone buzzed—a text from Nathaniel: Dinner tonight? 8 PM. Le Ciel.

Her thumb hovered over the screen. Part of her wanted to cancel, to bury herself in work. But another part, the part that still remembered how his lips felt against hers last night, typed: I'll be there.

The office was chaos. Gabrielle rushed to her side the moment she stepped off the elevator. "Mr. Wilson's been calling every fifteen minutes. He's threatening to sue for damages unless we revise the entire structural design by Friday."

Evelyn's heels clicked against the marble floor as she strode toward the conference room. "Get me the original blueprints. And call Jonathan Blake—no, actually, set up a meeting with Sebastian directly. Today."

Gabrielle hesitated. "He's... not taking our calls."

Of course he wasn't. Evelyn clenched her jaw. This had Isabella Davis written all over it. That woman had connections everywhere, including Summit Realty's board.

Her phone rang again—Charlotte this time. "You need to see this," her best friend said without preamble. A link popped up on her screen.

The society column headline burned her retinas: Martin Heir Spotted with Ex at Charity Gala—While Wife Works Late Again. The accompanying photo showed Nathaniel smiling at something Isabella was whispering in his ear, her manicured fingers resting on his forearm.

Evelyn's vision blurred. She'd known about the gala. He'd asked her to come. She'd said she was too busy with the Riverside project.

Gabrielle cleared her throat. "The structural engineer is waiting in Conference Room B."

Evelyn squared her shoulders. "Tell him I'll be right there." She typed a reply to Charlotte: Not now. Then, after a heartbeat, added: Save the article.

The day passed in a haze of calculations and tense negotiations. At 7:45 PM, she stood outside Le Ciel, smoothing her emerald green dress. The maître d' led her to their usual corner table.

Nathaniel stood as she approached. His gaze swept over her, lingering on the hollows beneath her eyes. "You look exhausted."

"Long day," she murmured, accepting the kiss he pressed to her cheek. His cologne—sandalwood and something darker—wrapped around her like a familiar embrace.

He waited until they'd ordered before speaking again. "You saw the photos."

It wasn't a question. Evelyn took a sip of wine. "I did."

"Isabella showed up uninvited. I was just being polite."

"Of course." The words tasted bitter. "Just like you were 'just being polite' when you had lunch with her last week?"

His eyes flashed. "You've been checking up on me?"

"Your secretary puts everything in your shared calendar, Nathaniel. It's not exactly covert."

The waiter arrived with their appetizers, forcing a temporary ceasefire. As he walked away, Nathaniel leaned forward. "What's really going on? This isn't about Isabella."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her fork. "Summit Realty is trying to back out of Riverside. They're claiming design flaws."

"And you think I had something to do with it?"

"Did you?"

The silence between them stretched taut. Somewhere in the restaurant, a glass shattered.

Nathaniel's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "You really believe I'd sabotage your career?"

Evelyn opened her mouth—then froze as her phone vibrated. Gregory's name flashed on the screen with the subject line: URGENT - Check your email.

Her stomach plummeted as she read the attached document. Summit Realty's formal complaint—cc'd to the entire architectural review board.

Nathaniel watched her face pale. "What is it?"

She stood abruptly, nearly knocking over her wine glass. "I have to go."

"Evelyn—"

But she was already walking away, the whispers of other diners following her out the door. The night air hit her like a slap. As her Uber pulled up, her phone buzzed once more.

Unknown number. A single sentence: You should have stayed away from what's mine.

The screen went dark before she could reply.

"Ms. Davis has been located, but she's running a high fever from exposure and is still receiving IV fluids."

"Understood. Keep watch here. Everything else can wait until he wakes."

Evelyn gave brief instructions before leaving the hospital room.

Part of her wanted to march straight to Isabella and demand answers, but the thought dissolved as quickly as it came.

Nathaniel had rushed out in the middle of a storm to find Isabella—no one had forced him at gunpoint. So what right did Evelyn have to interrogate her?

She drove straight back to Pineview Villa, showered, ate a light breakfast, then took another long bath before collapsing into bed.

At the hospital, Nathaniel stirred awake around eight in the morning.

Evelyn had already been gone for over an hour.

His vision cleared to reveal Isabella slumped in the chair beside him, head propped on her hand, eyes shut.

Nathaniel frowned, taking in her hospital gown and pallid complexion before the memories flooded back.

The anesthesia had worn off. Pain radiated from his wounds and fractured ankle with every slight movement.

Just then, Isabella blinked awake. Seeing him conscious, her face lit up. "Nathaniel! You're awake. How are you feeling? Should I call the doctor?"

"Don't bother." His voice was flat, lips bloodless. Every word sent fresh jolts of agony through him.

"Nathaniel, I'm so sorry. This is all my fault—"

"I don't blame you." He cut her off. "How are you holding up?"

"Just a slight fever. The meds helped." She shook her head, eyes puffy from crying. Seeing him bandaged and broken twisted something in her chest.

His expression remained neutral. "Where is everyone else?"

His gaze swept the room, searching for a familiar silhouette. When he found none, his jaw tightened imperceptibly.

Isabella hurried to explain, "Samuel went to gather your essentials. He'll return soon."

"I see."

Nathaniel said nothing more, closing his eyes. Exhaustion lined his bruised face. Fragments of the crash returned—the reckless speed, the swerve to avoid a red-light runner, the sickening impact.

Isabella watched him silently, not daring to disturb his rest.

Soon after, Samuel returned with supplies.

"Ms. Davis, is Mr. Martin awake?"

"He was, but he's sleeping again—"

"Samuel." Nathaniel's low voice cut through. "Take Isabella back to rest. There's nothing more for her here."

"Let me stay," Isabella pleaded. "I want to help. You got hurt because of me."

His gaze hardened. "No. Samuel will handle it. You need to recover."

The finality in his tone left no room for argument. With a reluctant nod, she let Samuel escort her out.

Once they'd gone, Nathaniel's question came sharp as a blade. "Where's Evelyn?"

Though his tone was even, displeasure darkened his features.

Samuel answered swiftly, "Mrs. Martin stayed through the night after your admission. She only left this morning once your condition stabilized. She must be resting at home by now."

Some of the ice in Nathaniel's expression thawed—but not enough.

"Shall I contact her?" Samuel ventured.

"No. Let her sleep."

The clipped response spoke volumes. Samuel tread carefully the rest of the day, avoiding further missteps.

Evelyn slept until mid-afternoon, waking to multiple missed calls from Gregory.

She dialed him back.

"Gregory? I was asleep. What's up?"

"Just checking in—you're never this late. You sound rough. Everything okay?"

"Didn't rest well. I'm skipping the office today. Those Summit Realty blueprints still need adjustments—see if they'll revise. If not, we'll have to work with what they gave us."

She dragged herself up, splashed water on her face, then headed downstairs to scrounge up lunch.

Her mind wandered. Should I inform the Martins about Nathaniel?

If he's keeping it quiet, word won't get out.

Better not worry Edward.

No calls came from the hospital.

Nathaniel would be awake by now.

Evelyn hesitated, then texted Caroline for an update.

The return call came swiftly. "Nathaniel's fine—awake and stable. Needs time to heal the fractures and injuries, but no complications."

"Good." Evelyn's voice gave nothing away.

Caroline hesitated. "I heard this happened because of Isabella?"

Evelyn's grip tightened on her phone. "Yes."

"What the hell? You're still married, and he nearly gets himself killed over her? This is unacceptable!"

Caroline fumed on her behalf. Evelyn was brilliant, stunning—even if the Mitchells couldn't match the Martins' stature, she didn't deserve this disrespect.

But Caroline bit back further outrage, not wanting to upset Evelyn more.

Evelyn offered no reaction. "What's done is done. Just keep me posted if anything changes."

"Of course."

With Nathaniel's condition confirmed, Evelyn had no intention of visiting.

The whole ordeal was a splinter lodged deep—not fatal, but festering with every breath.

Caroline's words had struck a nerve. Still married, yet he'd risk his life for Isabella. Where does that leave me?

She'd thought she could brush it off. But the wound refused to close.

Evelyn stayed away. Nathaniel didn't reach out.

A silent standoff.

Pain kept Nathaniel drifting in and out of sleep. By nightfall, frustration gnawed at him—trapped in bed, reliant on a catheter, utterly helpless.

Isabella returned at dawn, fussing over him.

His continued indifference unsettled her. Desperate to break the silence, she ventured, "Hasn't Evelyn visited? Is she... upset because of me?"
###Chapter 51

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains as Evelyn stretched beneath the silk sheets. Her fingers brushed against the cold emptiness beside her - Nathaniel had already left for his early meeting. The digital clock blinked 7:32 AM in bold red numbers.

She reached for her phone, finding three unread messages. The first was from Gabrielle, her assistant, reminding her about the client presentation at ten. The second was from Charlotte, her best friend, suggesting lunch at that new Italian place downtown. The third made her fingers freeze mid-swipe.

Isabella Davis flashed across the screen.

Evelyn's throat tightened as she opened the message. "We need to talk. Coffee at The Grind? 9 AM." Simple words that carried the weight of a thousand unspoken threats.

The shower water scalded her skin as she tried to wash away the unease. Steam fogged the bathroom mirror, obscuring her reflection - perhaps a small mercy. She dressed mechanically in a navy blue pantsuit, her fingers fumbling with the pearl buttons.

Alfred, their butler, greeted her in the foyer with her usual espresso. "Madam, your car is ready." His kind eyes held unspoken concern. She'd been unusually quiet this morning.

The drive to the café took fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes of rehearsing what she might say, how she'd react. The Grind was nearly empty at this hour, its rustic charm lost on her today.

Isabella sat in the corner booth, her platinum blonde hair cascading over one shoulder. She looked up as Evelyn approached, her crimson lips curling into a smile that didn't reach her cold blue eyes.

"Evelyn." Isabella gestured to the seat opposite her. "I ordered you a latte. Still your favorite, isn't it?"

Evelyn remained standing. "What do you want, Isabella?"

The other woman's smile faltered. "Straight to business then." She reached into her designer handbag and slid a manila envelope across the table. "I thought you should see these before the press does."

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she opened the envelope. Photographs spilled out - Nathaniel and Isabella at various locations, their body language intimate. The most damning one showed them embracing outside a hotel, dated just three nights ago when Nathaniel had claimed to be working late.

Her vision blurred. The café sounds faded into white noise. Isabella's voice cut through the haze.

"He never stopped loving me, Evelyn. You were just... convenient."

Evelyn's phone buzzed violently in her pocket. Nathaniel's name flashed on the screen. She rejected the call with numb fingers.

Isabella leaned forward, her perfume suddenly overwhelming. "Do us all a favor and walk away. Before this gets ugly."

The latte sat untouched as Evelyn turned on her heel and walked out, the photographs crumpled in her fist. The morning sun that had seemed so gentle now burned her skin as she stumbled toward her car.

Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was an alert from the architectural firm's security system. Someone had accessed her private office files after hours last night.

The pieces clicked together with terrifying clarity. This wasn't just about Nathaniel. Isabella was playing a much bigger game. And Evelyn had just walked right into her trap.

"Isabella, you're worrying too much. You don't have to stay here with me. Aren't you busy preparing for your comeback?"

Nathaniel's tone was indifferent, his expression unreadable.

"My comeback isn't as important as you are. You got hurt because of me. I should be here taking care of you."

Every time Isabella thought about him risking his life in that accident just to find her, her heart swelled with both joy and fear. Joy, because he still cared. Fear, because he had been in danger.

But right now, he didn’t seem pleased at all.

Lowering her voice, Isabella murmured, "Nathaniel, Evelyn hasn’t visited you. Is she upset? I can apologize to her. I don’t want Edward to blame you for this. I’ll explain everything to her myself."

"No. My grandfather won’t find out about my injuries. I’m tired. You should go. It’s not appropriate for you to stay here every day."

His voice was quiet, his demeanor cold.

Before Isabella could respond, the door to the ward swung open. Both of them turned to see a familiar figure standing there.

Thomas smirked as he took in the scene. "Injured for a damsel in distress? People will sing your praises when this gets out."

Then his gaze shifted to Isabella. "Oh, Isabella’s here too. Long time no see. How have you been?"

"Thomas, it’s been a while. I’m fine." Isabella quickly stood to greet him, then glanced nervously at Nathaniel. "Nathaniel got hurt because of me. Please don’t tease him."

Thomas merely chuckled, but his eyes held something deeper as he studied Nathaniel.

With Thomas present, Isabella didn’t linger. She excused herself and left the ward—though she didn’t go far, lingering just outside the door.

Thomas wasted no time. "Nathaniel, you’re laid up like this, and Evelyn hasn’t come to see you? Did you not tell her? Or is she pissed you got hurt for Isabella?"

Nathaniel’s frown deepened, his glare sharp.

Thomas ignored it.

"What’s going on in that head of yours? If you can’t get divorced right now, you should at least keep your distance from Isabella. You can’t have both, you know. That’s just greedy."

"Thomas, if you’re bored, I can find something to occupy you."

Nathaniel’s voice was laced with warning.

"I’m just stating facts."

"Are you done? Get out."

Thomas grinned. "Want me to fetch Evelyn for you?"

"No need."

"I insist. You reek of disinfectant. Haven’t showered, have you? Must be uncomfortable. Wouldn’t want your reputation ruined. I’ll bring Evelyn over."

Nathaniel said nothing.

Thomas couldn’t tell if that was agreement or refusal.

Leaning in, he murmured, "Or should I ask Isabella to help you shower? I can pass along the message."

"Get lost."

Nathaniel’s glare was icy.

Thomas laughed, then abruptly sobered. "Was this really an accident?"

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed. "Does it matter? The rain that night washed everything away."

Some truths weren’t ready to surface yet.

Thomas didn’t press further.

Just then, a voice carried in from outside. "Ms. Davis, what are you doing here?"

It was Samuel.

Even through the door, his words were clear.

Nathaniel and Thomas exchanged a glance.

Isabella turned to face Samuel as he approached. "I wanted to ask Nathaniel if he’d like something to eat. I’ll prepare it for him."

Samuel nodded, then stepped inside.

After greeting Thomas, he said, "Mr. Martin, Ms. Davis asked if you’d like something to eat."

Isabella followed him in, her eyes flickering to Nathaniel. Seeing his unchanged expression, she added softly, "You should eat something. I’ll go home and have the chef make you some soup, okay?"

Nathaniel replied flatly, "Fine."

Thomas immediately cut in. "I’ll drive Isabella back. It’s been ages since we caught up."

Nathaniel didn’t object. Isabella couldn’t refuse.

Once outside the hospital, Thomas drove Isabella back to Pineview Villa.

Isabella smiled gently. "Thomas, thank you for the ride."

"Don’t mention it. We’re friends."

Thomas’s smile was light. Then he asked, "You’re staying at Pineview now?"

"Yes. Nathaniel was worried about my safety, so he insisted I stay here temporarily."

"He’s very good to you."

"He always has been."

Thomas glanced at her but said nothing more.

They made small talk to fill the silence.

Soon, they arrived.

Isabella offered politely, "Thomas, would you like to come in for coffee?"

"Sure. Thanks."

His quick agreement caught her off guard, but she recovered swiftly, ushering him inside with enthusiasm. She handed him slippers, led him to the living room, and called for a servant to bring coffee.

She moved like the lady of the house.

Alfred himself brought the coffee. Recognizing Thomas, he greeted him. Thomas asked, "Where’s Evelyn?"

"Ms. Mitchell is likely at the office," Alfred answered.

Thomas nodded. "Call her back. After all, she’s the hostess here."

Alfred didn’t hesitate. "Right away, sir."

"Thanks."

Thomas smiled faintly, then turned to Isabella—whose face had gone pale—and asked, "Isabella, you don’t mind, do you?"
###Chapter 52

The morning sun cast golden streaks across our bedroom as I stirred awake. Nathaniel's arm draped protectively over my waist, his steady breathing warming the back of my neck. I carefully slipped out from beneath his embrace, not wanting to disturb his rare moment of peaceful sleep.

The penthouse smelled of freshly brewed coffee - Alfred must have already prepared breakfast. As I padded barefoot across the marble floors, my phone buzzed with an incoming call from Gregory.

"Evelyn, we've got a situation," his tense voice came through before I could even greet him. "Summit Realty just pulled out of the waterfront project. Sebastian Wilson left me a voicemail at 5 AM."

My stomach dropped. That project accounted for nearly forty percent of our quarterly revenue. "What reason did he give?"

"None. Just said they're 'reevaluating partnerships.'"

I gripped the countertop, my mind racing. This wasn't just business - Sebastian had been Nathaniel's rival since their Ivy League days. The timing couldn't be worse, with Nathaniel's grandfather Edward pressuring him about succession plans.

The shower turned on in our ensuite. Nathaniel would be up soon. "Call an emergency partners meeting for 10 AM," I instructed Gregory. "And pull all our correspondence with Summit from the past six months. I want to know if we missed any red flags."

As I ended the call, strong arms encircled my waist from behind. Nathaniel nuzzled my neck, his damp hair tickling my cheek. "Morning, Mrs. Martin," he murmured. "You're up early."

I turned in his embrace, forcing a smile. "Just getting a head start on the day." His piercing blue eyes studied me, and I knew he could tell something was wrong. Nathaniel always knew.

Before he could press me, his phone rang. Samuel's name flashed on the screen. Nathaniel sighed, giving me an apologetic kiss before answering. "Yates, this better be important."

I watched his expression darken as Samuel spoke. His jaw tightened in that particular way that meant trouble. When he hung up, he looked at me with grim understanding. "You heard about Summit."

I nodded. "Gregory just told me."

Nathaniel's phone buzzed again - this time with a text that made his face go pale. He showed me the screen: a gossip column photo of Isabella Davis leaving a hotel with Sebastian Wilson last night. The caption read: "Reunited and it feels so good? Former supermodel cozy with real estate mogul."

The pieces clicked into place with sickening clarity. Isabella was Nathaniel's ex who'd never gotten over their breakup. And Sebastian would happily use her to get to Nathaniel - through me.

Nathaniel's hands framed my face. "Evelyn, whatever game they're playing, we'll handle it together." His thumbs brushed my cheeks. "But you should know... Edward's called a family dinner tonight. He wants to discuss 'the future of Martin Group.'"

The shower still running in the background, the scent of coffee now bitter in my throat, I realized this wasn't just about one lost project. This was the opening move in a much larger battle - one that would test our marriage, our careers, and everything we'd built together.

And Isabella Davis had just taken her first shot across our bows.

"Absolutely not. You're correct. Evelyn is the lady of the house."

Isabella's response was icy, her earlier enthusiasm for Thomas vanishing instantly.

Thomas replied calmly, "Good."

"Take a seat. I'll have the chef prepare some soup for Nathaniel."

"Go ahead."

Isabella shot him a glance before heading to the kitchen.

Thomas and Nathaniel had been close since childhood—inseparable, really.

So Isabella didn’t dare disrespect him, let alone show any hint of displeasure.

But his words had rubbed her the wrong way.

In her mind, she cursed him for meddling.

Evelyn, in the middle of a meeting with Summit Realty’s project lead, received a call from Alfred.

When she learned Thomas was at Pineview Villa and wanted her to return, her stomach twisted. "Alfred, please tell him I’m tied up with work. I might not be back soon."

The only reason she could think of for Thomas seeking her out was Nathaniel’s hospitalization.

After that, Alfred didn’t call again, and she threw herself into work.

Summit Realty was finalizing the artwork—Martin Group would officially begin the project in two weeks. Time was tight.

Her thoughts drifted to Nathaniel. Her face paled, her focus slipping.

Gregory leaned in, whispering, "Evelyn, are you feeling unwell?"

She snapped back to reality, shaking her head.

"No, just lost in thought."

"What’s wrong?" Gregory pressed gently.

Evelyn hesitated before confessing, "Nathaniel was hospitalized after a car accident. Because of Isabella, I don’t want to visit him. Do you think that’s wrong?"

"Did the accident happen because of her?"

"Indirectly."

He’d been looking for her, after all.

Gregory said evenly, "If he was acting for someone else, the fault was never yours to begin with. You’re justified in staying away."

"Really?"

"A man must own his choices—and their consequences. You’re not obligated to clean up his mess."

His words were firm, but guilt still gnawed at her.

By five in the evening, she drove back to Pineview Villa.

The sight of the white Mercedes parked by the garage made her frown.

She parked and stepped inside.

Thomas lounged on the sofa, scrolling through his phone with bored disinterest.

She blinked in surprise. "Thomas?"

"The one and only." He straightened, setting his phone aside with a faint smile. "Evelyn, I’ve been waiting."

"I told Alfred not to expect me."

She took a seat across from him, her expression cool.

"Since I came all this way, I wasn’t leaving without seeing you."

"What do you want?"

"One thing. Will you hear me out?" His tone was polite, almost pleading.

His demeanor made refusal difficult.

Thomas continued, "I hope you’ll visit Nathaniel. I know you’re angry—rightfully so. But he’s injured. As his wife, you should be there. You can’t let Isabella hover over him indefinitely, can you?"

Evelyn smirked. "I think he’d prefer her company over mine."

"That’s speculation. You haven’t visited since yesterday. He hasn’t even showered—depressed as hell. If I filmed him like this and sold it to the press, I’d make a killing."

"Feel free. Might be a lucrative side hustle."

Their exchange was light, almost playful.

But Evelyn never agreed.

Thomas knew little about her beyond her devotion to Nathaniel. In their year of marriage, she’d always been the one reaching out. But after this conversation, he wondered if that dynamic would shift.

Thomas studied her intently, his voice dropping. "We’re not close, and I never beg. But if you visit him, consider me in your debt. Any favor, anytime."

Evelyn laughed softly.

She knew Nathaniel hadn’t asked for her. That much was obvious.

But Thomas’s persistence intrigued her. After a pause, she relented—not for Nathaniel, but to spare the Martin Group unnecessary scandal.

Thomas personally drove her to the hospital, as if fearing she’d bolt.

At the ward door, Evelyn reached for the handle, but Thomas stopped her. "Allow me. You’re my guest tonight."

"Thanks." Her smile was thin.

The scene inside wiped it clean off her face.

Her voice turned glacial. "Sorry to interrupt."

She hadn’t even stepped inside before turning to leave.

Thomas caught her arm. "Evelyn, wait. Let’s talk this through."

He guided her into the ward, shutting the door behind them. The air thickened with tension.

Isabella sat perched on the edge of the bed, spoon in hand, feeding Nathaniel.

He’d refused at first, waiting for Samuel. But she’d insisted—until he gave in.

Just as the spoon neared his lips, Evelyn walked in.

Isabella set the bowl down hastily. "Evelyn, you’re here. I thought you were busy, so I brought soup for Nathaniel."

Evelyn ignored her, her gaze locked on the man in the bed.

He looked nothing like the lifeless figure wheeled out of surgery.

A bitter thought crossed her mind: I almost wish he’d stayed that way.

Nathaniel stared back.

Her outfit was different today—a denim skirt with a slit, her calves exposed. She stood just out of reach, Thomas’s grip still on her arm.

Nathaniel’s frown deepened. "She’s here now. Do you really think she’ll run?"
###Chapter 53

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of our penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. I stretched beneath the silk sheets, my fingers brushing against the empty space where Nathaniel should have been. The lingering scent of his cologne told me he hadn't left long ago.

My phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. Gabrielle's name flashed across the screen. "Evelyn, you need to see this," her message read, followed by a link to a gossip column. My stomach dropped as I clicked it open.

There, splashed across the page, was a photo of Nathaniel leaving a luxury hotel at 2 AM—with Isabella draped over his arm like a designer accessory. The headline screamed: Martin Heir Rekindles Old Flame?

I threw the phone onto the bed as if it had burned me. The rational part of my brain knew tabloids exaggerated everything, but the image of his hand resting on the small of her back made my vision blur.

The penthouse elevator pinged. I barely had time to wipe my eyes before Nathaniel strode in, carrying two steaming coffee cups. "Morning, darling," he said, pressing a kiss to my temple. His usual morning greeting. As if nothing was wrong.

"Interesting night?" I asked, my voice deceptively light as I gestured to his phone where the same article was undoubtedly waiting.

He froze mid-sip. "Evelyn, it's not what it looks like."

"Isn't it always?" I stood, wrapping my robe tighter around myself. "Because from where I'm standing, it looks exactly like you promised—no more secrets, no more lies—and yet here we are again."

Nathaniel set the coffees down with deliberate calm. "It was a business meeting that ran late. Isabella showed up uninvited. I was walking her out when the paparazzi appeared—conveniently timed, don't you think?"

A bitter laugh escaped me. "How very coincidental."

His jaw tightened. "You don't believe me."

The unspoken question hung between us, heavier than the designer chandelier above. Did I? After everything we'd been through?

Before I could answer, his phone rang. Samuel's name appeared. Nathaniel silenced it, but not before I saw the preview: Emergency board meeting called. Edward's orders.

"Go," I said, turning toward the window. "Your empire awaits."

His reflection appeared behind mine in the glass. "This conversation isn't over."

When the elevator doors closed behind him, I finally let the tears fall. Outside, the city glittered mockingly—a kingdom Nathaniel had given me, yet one where I still felt like an outsider looking in.

My phone buzzed again. This time, it was Gregory. Need you at the office ASAP. Summit Realty just underbid us on the waterfront project. By exactly 5%. Someone's feeding them our numbers.

Ice flooded my veins. There were too many coincidences piling up. And I knew in my bones—someone was playing a very dangerous game.

The question was: who?

He was speaking to Thomas.

Thomas immediately released his grip and smirked, "My mistake."

Evelyn froze, her cheeks flushing when she realized Nathaniel was referring to Thomas holding her arm.

Isabella's expression darkened instantly.

Thomas narrowed his eyes. "Well, your wife is here now. Can we leave?"

Nathaniel remained silent.

Thomas added, "Isabella, you must be starving. Let's grab a bite. You should rest—leave this to Evelyn."

Isabella instinctively glanced at Nathaniel, but he gave no reaction.

Did he agree?

Her voice trembled. "I should stay. He got hurt because of me. I’d feel awful if Evelyn took over."

She emphasized because of me, making sure Evelyn understood Nathaniel would risk everything for her. She wanted Evelyn to walk away.

But Evelyn hadn’t even looked at her once.

Isabella clenched her fists. "Evelyn, are you mad at me? I’m sorry. Don’t blame Nathaniel. It’s all my fault. He’s here because of me. I wish it were me in that bed. Please don’t be angry. I’ll take responsibility."

"How?" Evelyn’s voice was ice. "By crashing yourself into a hospital too? Or getting banned by the Martins? If you’re so sorry, then shut up."

The room went dead silent.

Isabella’s eyes welled up. She turned to Nathaniel, whispering, "Nathaniel, I—"

"Let’s go eat. You’ve been here all day." Thomas cut in, grabbing her arm and steering her out.

The door clicked shut.

Silence.

They stared at each other, neither speaking. Minutes ticked by before Nathaniel finally said, "Did you not want to come?"

"No," Evelyn replied flatly.

"Evelyn, why didn’t you come back yesterday? Do you forget who you are?"

"Who am I?" she countered.

His jaw tightened. "My wife. I was in surgery, and you left before I woke. Weren’t you worried I wouldn’t?"

His cold glare forced her to look away.

"I didn’t sleep all night," she admitted. "I checked with the hospital. You had Samuel. And Isabella was here. Since you got hurt for her, I assumed you’d rather see her."

"Are you angry?"

His voice was softer now, studying her face.

Evelyn laughed humorlessly. "Nathaniel, shouldn’t I be? You’re my husband, yet you raced through a storm at midnight for another woman. Tell me—should I applaud?"

He tried to sit up, wincing as his wound protested.

"Stop." She pressed him back, her hands firm on his shoulders.

Her scent—subtle, intoxicating—filled the sterile air.

His voice dropped. "Evelyn... are you jealous?"

"I’m not."

"Then why react like that?"

"Stating facts. We’re still married. I signed your surgery forms."

Nathaniel’s lips quirked. "Since we are, I’ll claim my rights. Feed me the soup."

No embarrassment. Just quiet command.

Evelyn exhaled, picking up the bowl. Spoon by spoon, she fed him in silence.

When he finished, he spoke first. "The accident wasn’t planned. The rain was too heavy. I couldn’t see."

She paused.

Was he... defending Isabella?

He loved her that much?

Evelyn’s chest tightened.

"Don’t be angry," he murmured, uncharacteristically gentle.

She met his eyes, aching to ask: Do you love her more than me?

Instead, she said, "Nathaniel, your grandfather worries our divorce will hurt the Martins. But since our marriage was secret, so can the divorce be. Like now—he won’t know unless you tell him. So why not end this cleanly?"

Nathaniel’s face turned to stone.

"What’s clean about it?" he bit out.

###Chapter 54

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew over the blueprints, making precise adjustments with her mechanical pencil. The scent of freshly brewed coffee from Gabrielle's desk mingled with the crisp paper smell.

A sharp knock interrupted her concentration. "Come in," she called without looking up.

The door swung open to reveal Nathaniel, his tailored navy suit accentuating his broad shoulders. "Working through lunch again?" His deep voice held a note of amused disapproval.

Evelyn finally glanced up, her pencil pausing mid-stroke. "This proposal for the waterfront development is due tomorrow." She gestured at the scattered documents. "Gregory's meeting with the investors at three."

Nathaniel stepped closer, his cologne - something woodsy with a hint of citrus - enveloping her. "You've been at this since seven." He plucked the pencil from her fingers. "Even genius architects need to eat."

Before she could protest, his phone buzzed. His expression darkened as he read the message. "Isabella's back in town."

Evelyn's stomach clenched. She forced her voice steady. "For how long?"

"Indefinitely, according to Vanessa." He pocketed his phone with a sharp movement. "She's taking over as creative director for Seraphina's new fashion line."

The news hit like a physical blow. Isabella Davis wasn't just Nathaniel's ex - she was the woman who'd shattered his heart before vanishing to Paris five years ago. The same woman whose photos still filled an album in the Martins' penthouse.

Evelyn's fingers found the emerald pendant at her throat - Nathaniel's anniversary gift. "Does Edward know?"

"He will by dinner." Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Grandfather always had a soft spot for her."

Outside, the city hummed with midday activity, oblivious to the storm brewing in the glass-walled office. Evelyn studied her husband's tense profile, the way his knuckles whitened around his phone. The Isabella-shaped shadow that had loomed over their marriage since day one was about to become very real.

Gabrielle chose that moment to appear with two takeout containers. "Your usuals from- oh!" She froze in the doorway, sensing the tension. "Should I come back later?"

"No, we're done here." Nathaniel took the food and set it on Evelyn's desk. His thumb brushed her cheekbone. "Don't work too late."

The door clicked shut behind him, leaving Evelyn staring at the blueprint where her pencil had left an unintended dark smudge. Right across the proposed couple's retreat. Fitting.

Her phone vibrated with a text from Caroline: Heard the news. Drinks tonight? You'll need them.

Evelyn exhaled slowly. Somewhere in the city, Isabella Davis was unpacking her designer luggage. And nothing in Evelyn's carefully constructed life would ever be the same again.

She hesitated briefly before replying, "Our divorce won't affect Martin Group's stability."

"So my near-fatal accident means nothing compared to your rush to divorce me?" Nathaniel's voice turned icy. "I'm bedridden, yet you're desperate to file papers? Worried my injuries might inconvenience you?"

Evelyn was baffled.

What twisted logic was this?

She opened her mouth to clarify, but he continued, "You're upset because Isabella was involved in my accident, aren't you? Admit it, Evelyn—you're jealous." His tone held finality, not curiosity.

Her lashes fluttered as she met his gaze. After a prolonged silence, she countered, "Suppose I am? How would you explain yourself?"

"Are you in love with me?" Nathaniel fired back.

"What do you think?" She maintained her composure.

"Since you claim not to love me, why the outrage? Isn't that jealousy?" His smirk confirmed he'd already decided her feelings, regardless of her denials.

A humorless laugh escaped her. "If our positions were reversed—if I'd raced through a storm for another man and wound up hospitalized—would you calmly accept it?"

Nathaniel's expression darkened instantly, his glare turning arctic.

Abruptly changing subjects, he muttered, "I need to bathe. Now."

"Now?" Her brows knitted.

"Yes. Now."

"Then I'll call the nurse—"

"The nurse?" His interruption was razor-sharp. "Absolutely not."

"You're covered in injuries. A professional—"

"No." His jaw set stubbornly. "You'll do it."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "You can barely stand. This is reckless—"

"Do I repulse you now?" His voice dropped dangerously as he studied her reaction.

She froze. Where had that come from? "That's not—I'm trying to prevent further injury. Let me call Thomas—"

"No." His refusal was absolute. "We're married. Or does that only matter when convenient for you?"

Her hands clenched. "Fine."

As she prepared the basin, his voice followed her. "Evelyn. Do you hate me?"

The question made her pause. "No."

"Then why the reluctance? If it's truly unbearable, leave."

"It's my responsibility."

"Only duty binds you?"

She didn't answer, focusing on wringing the towel. His relentless stare burned her skin. "Stop looking at me."

"Am I not permitted to look at my own wife?"

"Your staring makes this impossible."

"I'm merely observing. Continue."

With clipped movements, she cleaned his torso and redressed him. "Done."

His eyebrow arched. "Half-done at best."

Following his pointed glance downward, heat flooded her cheeks. Though they'd been intimate, this clinical exposure unsettled her.

When she hesitated, Nathaniel seized her wrist. "Your disgust is obvious."

"That's not—"

He tugged sharply. She lost balance, knee landing on his injured thigh. The bandage bloomed crimson.

"Damn it!" She scrambled to inspect the damage, heart pounding. The gash had reopened.

Nathaniel, however, smiled faintly. "You were worried."

"Are you insane?" She rarely used his full name. "This isn't a game!"

His smile deepened inexplicably. "I needed to know if you cared. Your delayed hospital visit already fuels rumors."

Her temper snapped. "How dare you? You got hurt protecting Isabella, yet you're accusing me?"

The air between them crackled with unspoken accusations.

###Chapter 55

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew over the blueprints as she made last-minute adjustments to the resort design. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint aroma of ink from her markers.

"Miss Mitchell?" Gabrielle's voice came through the intercom. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn pressed the reply button. "Send him in, please."

The door swung open to reveal Gregory Wilson, his usual crisp suit slightly rumpled from what appeared to be a rushed morning. He carried two steaming cups, placing one before Evelyn. "Thought you could use this. You've been here since dawn, haven't you?"

She accepted the coffee gratefully, the warmth seeping into her fingers. "The client moved the presentation up to this afternoon. I just want everything perfect."

Gregory leaned against her desk, studying the plans. "It's brilliant work, Evelyn. Though I suspect that's not what's really troubling you."

Evelyn's pencil stilled. She'd been trying to ignore the gnawing anxiety in her stomach since receiving Nathaniel's text about meeting for lunch today. After their explosive argument last week, she wasn't sure what to expect.

"Just pre-presentation jitters," she deflected, tracing a line on the blueprint with unnecessary precision.

Before Gregory could press further, Evelyn's phone buzzed. Nathaniel's name flashed on the screen with a simple message: "Looking forward to our lunch. I have something important to tell you."

Her heart skipped a beat. Important could mean anything from reconciliation to divorce papers. The uncertainty was maddening.

At precisely noon, Evelyn found herself smoothing her skirt for the third time as she entered The Glasshouse, the restaurant where they'd had their first date. The hostess led her to their usual table in the conservatory, where sunlight filtered through lush greenery.

Nathaniel stood as she approached, his tailored navy suit accentuating his broad shoulders. His expression was unreadable, but his eyes - those piercing blue eyes - held an intensity that made her breath catch.

"Evelyn." He pulled out her chair, his fingers brushing her shoulder briefly. "You look beautiful."

The simple compliment sent warmth flooding through her. She searched his face for clues. "You said you had something important to tell me?"

Nathaniel took a deep breath, his fingers tightening around his water glass. "I've been doing a lot of thinking since our fight. About us, about the future..."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. This was it - the moment that would determine everything.

Just as Nathaniel opened his mouth to continue, a familiar laugh rang out across the restaurant. Evelyn turned to see Isabella Davis making her way toward them, her designer heels clicking against the marble floor.

"Darling!" Isabella air-kissed Nathaniel's cheek before turning to Evelyn with a saccharine smile. "What a coincidence running into you both here!"

Evelyn's stomach dropped. The timing couldn't possibly be accidental. She watched as Nathaniel's jaw tensed, his earlier vulnerability replaced by guarded politeness.

The carefully balanced moment between them shattered like glass. Whatever Nathaniel had been about to say would have to wait - again. And Evelyn couldn't shake the feeling that Isabella's appearance was anything but coincidental.

He knew his wound would reopen, yet he did it anyway.
Was he completely out of his mind?

Evelyn had been restless since she first heard about Nathaniel’s car accident in the early hours of yesterday. She had hoped for some space to collect herself, but instead, he had pushed her relentlessly until she was on the verge of breaking down.

Now, her mood was foul, her eyes rimmed red.

Nathaniel noticed the shift in her demeanor and opened his mouth to speak, but Evelyn had already turned away, striding toward the door.

"I'll get the nurse," she muttered, slipping out before he could respond.

Moments later, the nurse arrived to examine his wound, rebandaging it with a stern warning. "Mr. Martin, if this wound splits again, it could damage the bone. You’d need another surgery."

"Understood," Evelyn replied coolly, standing at a distance, arms crossed.

Once the nurse left, she didn’t resume cleaning him. Instead, she emptied the basin in the bathroom, washed the towel, and hung it up without a word.

The room fell into heavy silence.

Nathaniel watched her closely as she settled onto the sofa, pointedly ignoring him.

"Evelyn?" His voice was soft, coaxing.

No response.

"I'm thirsty. Could you pour me some water?"

"No. Wait until the nurse comes back. That way, you won’t tear your stitches again." Her tone was flat, leaving no room for argument.

Nathaniel studied her.

In all the years he’d known her, Evelyn rarely lost her temper. Even when she did, a few gentle words were enough to smooth things over. If he softened his tone, she’d always relent.

But this time—she was angry.

He stayed quiet. The sky outside darkened. Neither Thomas nor Samuel had returned yet.

Was she staying the night?

Her stomach growled loudly in the stillness, betraying her hunger.

Evelyn stiffened, cheeks flushing.

Nathaniel’s lips twitched. "You haven’t eaten?"

Silence.

"Are you hungry?"

"I’m fine," she snapped.

"I heard otherwise."

Her glare could have melted steel. "You heard nothing."

Nathaniel exhaled, amused. "Fine. I must have imagined it. But I’m still hungry. I’ll ask Samuel to bring food. Will you eat with me?"

She said nothing.

"If you don’t answer, I’ll take that as a yes."

He reached for his phone, calling Samuel to arrange dinner—though the meal was clearly for her, not him.

Evelyn ate in silence, mind racing. Why was he doing this? Why the sudden kindness?

But this meal came with strings. Now, she had to stay and care for him.

Later, she texted Caroline in secret: Will staying at the hospital affect the baby?

Caroline’s reply was swift. No, but it’ll wreck your mood. Why are you even bothering with Nathaniel? Let Isabella handle him.

Evelyn smirked. You’re right. But we’re married. It’s my responsibility. And trust me—Isabella will suffer more if I stay.

She wasn’t wrong.

Evelyn stayed the night, and Isabella arrived first thing in the morning with clam chowder from Pineview Villa’s chef.

She came early—too early. Nathaniel, who had barely slept due to the pain, was not pleased.

Isabella beamed. "Nathaniel, I had the chef make your favorite. Oh—Evelyn, there’s none for you. You don’t mind, do you?"

Evelyn barely glanced at her.

Undeterred, Isabella lifted a spoonful to Nathaniel’s lips. "Here, try it—"

"Leave it," he said, turning his head away.

Isabella’s smile faltered. "Are you in pain? Should I call the nurse?"

"I haven’t washed up yet." His tone was icy.

"I’ll stay and take care of you today. Evelyn must be exhausted."

Evelyn snorted. "How generous. Though, when you say ‘home,’ you mean my house, right?"

Isabella flinched. "I—I didn’t mean to upset you. I just didn’t know what you liked—"

"Relax. I don’t care." Evelyn grabbed toiletries for Nathaniel and shoved them at him.

After he washed up, Samuel arrived with breakfast.

"Eat," Nathaniel murmured to Evelyn.

She ignored him.

Isabella tried again with the chowder, but Nathaniel refused. "I can feed myself. Shouldn’t you be preparing for your comeback single?"

Isabella sighed dramatically. "It’s... hard. My voice isn’t what it used to be. Maybe I should quit."

"You’ll be fine. Just practice."

Her face lit up. "I’ll work harder!"

Evelyn picked at her food, appetite gone.

No matter what, his concern was always for Isabella.

She laughed bitterly, heart aching.

###Chapter 56

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Pineview Villa, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. Evelyn stood by the window, her fingers tracing the delicate rim of her coffee cup. The warmth of the porcelain seeped into her skin, but it did little to ease the tension coiling in her chest.

Nathaniel had left early again—another "urgent meeting" that required his immediate attention. She sighed, setting the cup down with a soft clink. These days, it felt like she saw more of Alfred, their butler, than her own husband.

Her phone buzzed on the counter. A message from Gregory flashed across the screen: "The client loved your design. They want to discuss revisions today. Can you come in?"

Evelyn hesitated. She had planned to visit her grandmother, Beatrice, at the nursing home. But work was work, and the project was important. She typed a quick reply: "I’ll be there in an hour."

As she grabbed her keys, the front door swung open. Nathaniel strode in, his tailored suit immaculate, his expression unreadable.

"You're back early," she remarked, trying to keep her tone light.

He barely glanced at her as he loosened his tie. "Change of plans."

She waited for more, but he offered nothing else. The silence between them stretched, thick and suffocating.

Evelyn bit her lip. "I have to head to the office. Gregory needs me for a client meeting."

Nathaniel finally looked at her, his dark eyes unreadable. "Do what you need to do."

The dismissal stung. She turned away before he could see the hurt in her eyes.

The architecture firm was bustling when she arrived. Gabrielle, her assistant, greeted her with a stack of files. "The client’s already in the conference room. They’re... intense."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Aren’t they always?"

Inside the conference room, Gregory was deep in discussion with a sharply dressed man—Sebastian Wilson, the owner of Summit Realty. His gaze flicked to Evelyn as she entered, and a slow, calculating smile spread across his face.

"Ah, the brilliant Evelyn Mitchell," he said, rising to his feet. "I’ve heard so much about you."

She shook his hand, ignoring the way his fingers lingered a second too long. "Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Wilson."

Gregory cleared his throat. "Sebastian has some... thoughts about the waterfront project."

Sebastian leaned back in his chair, his smirk never fading. "I think it needs more... drama. Something bold. Unforgettable."

Evelyn resisted the urge to roll her eyes. Clients like him always wanted "drama," but rarely understood the cost of it.

"I’ll see what I can do," she said smoothly.

As the meeting dragged on, her phone buzzed again. A message from Caroline: "Emergency girls’ night. My place. 8 PM. No excuses."

Evelyn almost smiled. At least someone wanted her company.

Later that evening, wine glass in hand, Evelyn slumped onto Caroline’s couch. "I don’t know what’s happening with Nathaniel. It’s like he’s a completely different person."

Caroline swirled her own wine, thoughtful. "Men are idiots. But maybe there’s more to it."

Evelyn scoffed. "Like what?"

Before Caroline could answer, Evelyn’s phone rang. An unknown number flashed on the screen.

She hesitated, then answered. "Hello?"

A woman’s voice, smooth as silk, replied, "Evelyn Mitchell? We need to talk."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold. She recognized that voice.

Isabella Davis.

Nathaniel’s ex.

And from the sound of it, she wasn’t calling to chat.

Evelyn gripped her phone tighter. "About what?"

Isabella’s laugh was like ice. "About the secrets your husband’s been keeping."

The line went dead.

Evelyn stared at her phone, her heart pounding.

Secrets?

What the hell was Nathaniel hiding?

And why was Isabella Davis suddenly back in their lives?

The wine in her stomach turned to lead.

Something was very, very wrong.

Isabella hesitated before her agent Vanessa pulled her away. Her schedule overflowed with commitments—recording a new single and filming promotional content. With the powerful backing of the Martin Group, her comeback had sent ripples through the entertainment industry.

Congratulations poured in from fellow celebrities.

Yet, amid the excitement, one concern gnawed at her: she desperately wanted the legendary composer and lyricist, Isaac Whitman, to craft her next song. But Isaac had vanished from public life, making contact nearly impossible.

After much deliberation, Isabella resolved to confide in Nathaniel.

"Nathaniel, I need Isaac Whitman to write lyrics for my song, but I can't reach him. Could you help?"

"Isaac Whitman?"

"Yes. Even though he's reclusive, his work is still revered. A collaboration with him would be perfect. Can you arrange it?"

Isaac had been a prodigy since youth—brilliant but distant, rarely engaging with others. Few could even get close to him.

Nathaniel frowned. "Contacting him won't be easy. Can your comeback wait? I could ask Samuel to find another songwriter."

"Please, Nathaniel. I need Isaac."

Her insistence wasn’t just about the song—it was about proving Nathaniel’s devotion and, more importantly, rubbing it in Evelyn’s face.

She couldn’t afford rejection, especially not in front of her.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened, his gaze turning icy.

Seeing this, Isabella’s eyes welled up. "I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked. It’s just—I want to be the best version of myself again, like I was before..."

"I’ll have Samuel reach out. No promises."

His tone was clipped, his face unreadable.

"Thank you! I knew you’d help me."

Her smile radiated triumph, every inch of her glowing with satisfaction.

She shot Evelyn a smug glance, silently declaring, See? He still chooses me.

Evelyn, however, barely reacted.

She had long stopped caring about Isabella’s theatrics.

For nearly three weeks, Nathaniel had remained hospitalized—mostly under Evelyn’s care.

Even when Isabella visited, he’d call for Evelyn the moment he needed anything.

Evelyn wondered if he was sparing Isabella the trouble... or simply didn’t want her around.

She dismissed the thought quickly.

Nathaniel could never want her.

His kindness was just marital obligation—nothing more.

That evening, as they arrived at Martin Manor, Edward studied Evelyn with concern.

"You look pale, dear. Are you eating properly?"

"I’m fine, Grandpa. Don’t worry."

Though nausea struck occasionally, it wasn’t severe.

Edward sighed but didn’t press further. Instead, he turned to Nathaniel, his voice sharp.

"Do you still respect this family, Nathaniel?"

"Of course."

"Then why hide your accident? Concealing injuries for a woman? Have you lost all sense?"

Though Nathaniel’s facial wounds had healed, his foot injury lingered. He walked carefully, but Edward saw through it.

The room tensed.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened, his eyes flicking to Evelyn.

Her stomach twisted under his gaze.

Richard interjected, "It wasn’t Evelyn who told us. Dr. Harrison mentioned it during his last visit. We’re disappointed in you, son."

"You can’t gamble with your life like this," Victoria added quietly.

Nathaniel stayed silent until they finished. "It was an accident. I didn’t want to worry you."

"That’s no excuse. Cut ties with Isabella." Edward’s tone left no room for argument.

Nathaniel’s silence thickened the air.

Evelyn hesitated, then spoke up. "Grandpa, there’s something I need to tell you."

Her words diffused the tension, redirecting the conversation.

Once in Edward’s study, he studied her. "Are you defending him?"

"Not exactly. I... need advice."

"Go on."

She took a shaky breath. "I don’t know if I should tell Nathaniel... I’m pregnant."

The question had haunted her since he postponed their divorce.

Now, more than ever, she needed guidance.

###Chapter 57

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting golden streaks across our bedroom. I stretched lazily, my fingers brushing against Nathaniel's side of the bed—already empty and cool to the touch. A faint trace of his cologne lingered in the air, that intoxicating blend of sandalwood and spice that always made my pulse quicken.

Downstairs, the mansion buzzed with quiet activity. Alfred moved soundlessly through the halls, directing the staff with practiced efficiency. The scent of freshly brewed coffee and Rosalind's famous blueberry scones wafted from the kitchen, making my stomach growl in anticipation.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin," Alfred greeted me with a slight bow as I entered the dining room. "Mr. Martin left early for the office. He asked me to inform you that he'll be home by seven for your anniversary dinner."

I smiled, tracing the rim of my coffee cup. Seven years. Seven years since Nathaniel had swept into my life like a storm, upending my carefully constructed world with his stubborn charm and relentless pursuit. Who would have thought the arrogant heir to Martin Group would become my greatest love?

My phone buzzed with an incoming call from Gregory. "Evelyn, we've got a situation," his voice crackled with urgency. "Summit Realty just pulled out of the waterfront project. Sebastian Wilson claims our designs don't meet their 'vision.'"

I nearly choked on my coffee. "What? We've been working on this for months! They approved every phase!"

"I know," Gregory sighed. "But apparently Jonathan Blake convinced them to go with another firm last night. Rumor has it Isabella Davis introduced them at some charity gala."

My fingers tightened around the phone. Isabella. Nathaniel's ex still couldn't resist stirring trouble, even after all these years. The waterfront project was crucial—not just for our firm's reputation, but for the community center we'd promised to build in the historic district.

"I'll handle it," I said firmly, already mentally rearranging my schedule. "Set up a meeting with Edward Martin. If anyone can reason with Sebastian, it's Nathaniel's grandfather."

As I ended the call, another notification popped up—a news alert featuring Isabella's flawless face beside a headline about Martin Group's rumored financial troubles. My blood ran cold. This wasn't just professional sabotage; it was personal.

The grandfather clock in the foyer chimed nine times. Somewhere in the city, Nathaniel was likely already in a boardroom, fighting his own battles. And here I was, ready to wage war for us both. Because that's what marriage meant—standing together even when the world tried to tear you apart.

I grabbed my portfolio and headed for the door, pausing only to adjust the emerald necklace Nathaniel had given me last Christmas. Today required armor, and nothing made me feel more invincible than wearing his love against my skin.

The game was afoot. And Isabella Davis was about to learn why they called me the Dragon Lady of architecture.

Edward Martin studied Evelyn with gentle concern. "Evelyn, he hasn't treated you well, has he? I can see it plainly. If he had, you wouldn’t be seeking a divorce—let alone keeping your pregnancy a secret. It’s clear he’s failed as a husband."

He sighed heavily, his expression weighted with disappointment. "Our family values loyalty. His grandmother, his parents, even I—we’ve never had such troubles. Sometimes I wonder if he’s been led astray by the wrong influences."

Evelyn shifted uncomfortably. "Please don’t say that. It’s not entirely his fault. We’re just... not right for each other."

"You don’t need to defend him. I’ve known Nathaniel since he was a boy." Edward’s voice softened. "Evelyn, if he had been the husband you deserved, you wouldn’t hesitate to give him another chance. Whether you tell him about the baby or not is your choice. Whatever you decide, I’ll stand by you."

Evelyn fell silent, torn.

Telling Nathaniel meant binding him to her life even after the divorce.

Keeping it secret felt selfish.

She was trapped in indecision.

Finally, she whispered, "I understand, Grandpa."

"Good girl. He should have cherished you better," Edward murmured.

Evelyn gave a faint, humorless smile.

Since Edward needed to rest, Evelyn excused herself.

As she closed the door, a tall figure blocked her path.

Their eyes met—she looked away first.

Nathaniel studied her, his gaze searching. "What did you and Grandpa talk about?"

"Nothing important."

"Really?" Skepticism laced his tone.

Memories of Edward’s questions about the accident surged forward. She lifted her chin, meeting his gaze coldly. "Believe what you want. No matter what I say, you’ll assume I’m scheming behind your back. You got hurt because of Isabella, yet you blamed me for turning your family against her."

Her words struck like a whip.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "I haven’t accused you of anything, yet you’re already attacking me. When did you become so sharp?"

"Does it matter? Your eyes say everything."

"You think you know what I’m thinking?"

"I don’t," she said icily.

He stepped closer, his breath warm against her ear. "I shouldn’t doubt you. I just worry too much. Don’t be angry with me. Please?"

The tenderness in his voice caught her off guard.

This was the problem—he could be so gentle it felt like love.

If Evelyn hadn’t known his heart belonged to Isabella, she might have believed it every time.

She lowered her head, silent.

Nathaniel hesitated. "Are you upset with me?"

"No," she said flatly.

Whether he believed her or not, he didn’t press further.

Edward never mentioned Isabella again, making Nathaniel suspect Evelyn had intervened.

After dinner, they returned home.

Once they left, Richard turned to his father. "Should we step in regarding Nathaniel and Isabella?"

"I will never accept a woman like her into this family. She wasn’t welcome before, and she won’t be now." Edward’s eyes hardened with resolve.

Richard nodded. "True, but we can’t let her linger around him. She’ll only hurt Evelyn further."

"I’ve been patient long enough. Even if they divorce, Evelyn remains family. Nathaniel needs to face the consequences of his choices."

Victoria and Richard exchanged glances but stayed silent.

Victoria spoke up. "We all adore Evelyn. If Nathaniel lets her go, he’ll regret it forever."

Edward’s thoughts drifted to Evelyn’s pregnancy. He wanted to shake Nathaniel until he understood the pain he’d caused.

Richard noticed his father’s tension. "Did Evelyn say something to you?"

Edward merely shook his head.

If Evelyn didn’t want Nathaniel to know, he’d respect that. A wife hiding her pregnancy from her husband? Nathaniel had disgraced the Martin name.

He didn’t deserve the truth.

Edward almost looked forward to the day Nathaniel found out.

During Nathaniel’s hospitalization, Martin Group had faced whispers of instability.

So the day after his discharge, he returned to work.

Before leaving, Evelyn reminded him, "Your injury hasn’t fully healed. Avoid straining yourself."

He listened quietly.

Isabella hovered nearby, watching his soft expression toward Evelyn with thinly veiled irritation. "Nathaniel, maybe I should skip work and accompany you? I can take care of you."

"No need. I’ll be fine."

His gaze lingered on Evelyn, already slipping on her shoes to leave.

Isabella’s interruption cut the moment short.

Three cars departed Pineview Villa—Samuel drove Nathaniel, Isabella rode with them, while Evelyn took her own car.

Watching Nathaniel’s car shrink in her rearview mirror, Evelyn’s chest ached.

She pressed her lips together and drove on.

By nine, Evelyn arrived at Martin Group with Jonathan Blake from Summit Realty to submit architectural plans. Approval meant signing contracts and breaking ground.

She hadn’t planned to alert Nathaniel, but Samuel spotted her.

He immediately informed Nathaniel, "Sir, Mrs. Martin is here with Summit Realty. They’re in the conference room reviewing the blueprints."

"She’s here?"

"Yes, just arrived."

Nathaniel stood. "Let’s take a look. It’s a good chance to catch any issues early."

Samuel blinked at his cluttered desk, baffled by Nathaniel’s sudden free time.

###Chapter 58

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn’s office, casting golden streaks across her blueprints. She exhaled sharply, rubbing her temples. The Summit Realty project was proving more challenging than she’d anticipated.

Her phone buzzed—Nathaniel.

"Dinner tonight?"

A small smile tugged at her lips. Despite the chaos, he always found a way to ground her.

"Only if you promise no business talk," she typed back.

Before she could set the phone down, Gabrielle burst in, her cheeks flushed. "Evelyn, you need to see this."

On the screen was a breaking news headline: "Isabella Davis Returns: Supermodel Announces Comeback Tour."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. Isabella. Nathaniel’s first love. The woman who had once held his heart.

Gabrielle hesitated. "There’s more."

The next image showed Isabella at a charity gala—standing beside Nathaniel, their arms linked.

Evelyn’s breath hitched. The event was last night.

He hadn’t mentioned it.

Her phone buzzed again—another message from Nathaniel.

"Looking forward to it. I have something to tell you."

The words blurred before her eyes.

Across town, Nathaniel adjusted his cufflinks, his reflection in the penthouse mirror tense. Samuel cleared his throat from the doorway.

"Sir, the board is expecting your response regarding the merger."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Later."

His phone chimed—Evelyn’s reply.

"Can’t wait."

Too short. Too formal.

Something was wrong.

Samuel hesitated. "Also, Miss Davis’s team called. Again."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "I have nothing to say to her."

But the past had a way of resurfacing when least expected.

Isabella smoothed her dress in the backseat of her limo, her agent Vanessa scrolling through her phone.

"The media is eating this up," Vanessa said. "Your reunion with Nathaniel Martin is trending."

Isabella smirked. "Good."

She tapped out a text to an old, familiar number.

"Missed you last night. Let’s catch up properly."

The message delivered.

No reply.

Her smile didn’t waver.

Patience was a virtue—one she’d mastered well.

Evelyn stared at her untouched coffee, the office chatter fading into white noise.

Isabella was back.

And Nathaniel had seen her.

Why hadn’t he said anything?

Her phone lit up—a notification from a gossip site.

"First Love Rekindled? Isabella Davis and Nathaniel Martin Spotted Together."

The accompanying photo showed them laughing, his hand on her lower back.

Evelyn’s vision tunneled.

The past wasn’t just resurfacing.

It was crashing down.

The conference room hummed with quiet anticipation as Evelyn projected the architectural designs onto the large screen. She turned to Daniel Carter, the Martin Group’s representative, her voice steady. "This proposal includes exterior, interior, and landscape designs. Please review and let me know if any modifications are necessary."

Evelyn’s work was a seamless blend of innovation and classical elegance—a testament to her expertise.

Daniel, a seasoned professional, scrutinized the blueprints with a critical eye but found no flaws. He posed a few technical questions, and Evelyn answered with confidence, her thorough preparation evident.

Satisfied, Daniel nodded. "The design is impressive. However, I’ll need final approval from our executives. This project is one of Mayby’s most anticipated developments this year. Is that acceptable, Ms. Mitchell?"

Evelyn’s response was calm. "Of course. Standard procedure."

The Summit Realty representative remained silent, recognizing the professional tone of the discussion. Though involved in the project, some intricacies still eluded them.

As Evelyn elaborated on certain design elements, the conference room door swung open, drawing all eyes toward the entrance.

A tall, striking figure stepped inside—Nathaniel Martin.

Daniel greeted him immediately. "Mr. Martin, perfect timing. We were just reviewing the project."

The Summit Realty representative introduced himself politely. "A pleasure, Mr. Martin. I represent Summit Realty."

Nathaniel acknowledged him with a brief nod before his gaze settled on Evelyn, who sat composed.

Daniel gestured toward her. "This is our architect, Ms. Mitchell."

Nathaniel’s voice was low, smooth. "Hello, Ms. Mitchell."

Evelyn stood, meeting his eyes directly. "Mr. Martin."

This marked their first formal meeting outside personal encounters.

Nathaniel’s presence shifted the atmosphere, lending it a quiet intensity.

At Daniel’s request, Evelyn presented the designs again, this time under Nathaniel’s scrutiny. His expression was unreadable—brows slightly furrowed, demeanor serious.

Then he spoke. "What are your thoughts on this project, Ms. Mitchell?"

His tone gave nothing away.

Evelyn didn’t waver. "Mr. Martin, I believe the core design is solid. Any adjustments would be minor, likely concerning exterior details. Personally, I’m very satisfied with the work."

Her words were direct.

The Summit Realty manager tensed, quickly interjecting, "Mr. Martin, Ms. Mitchell didn’t mean to imply—if you have any requests, we’re happy to accommodate them."

Leaning closer to Evelyn, he whispered, "Mr. Martin is our client. His preferences come first."

Evelyn’s lips thinned slightly, but she remained silent. Professional integrity shouldn’t bend for money. Some designs lost their essence when altered.

Nathaniel observed the exchange, his gaze flickering between Evelyn and the manager. Then he turned to Daniel. "Do you agree with Ms. Mitchell’s assessment?"

Daniel, long familiar with Nathaniel’s principles, answered honestly. "I believe she has a point."

The Summit Realty manager blinked in surprise.

Nathaniel’s lips curved faintly. "So do I."

With that settled, the meeting proceeded smoothly. Adjustments were finalized, and as conversation flowed, evening approached.

Samuel Yates, Nathaniel’s secretary, checked the time. "Mr. Martin has arranged dinner for everyone. The reservation is ready—shall we head out?"

The Summit Realty team was visibly honored by the invitation. Evelyn accepted gracefully, though Daniel suspected this dinner held deeper significance.

As they gathered outside the Martin Building, Nathaniel turned to Evelyn. "Ms. Mitchell, ride with me. I’d like to discuss a few design specifics."

She agreed with a polite smile. The air between them was calm, unreadable.

Then her phone buzzed—a message from Gregory.

[Done with the meeting?]

[Just finished. Dinner with the team. Might return to the office after.]

[Let me know if you need anything.]

[Will do.]

As she pocketed her phone, she caught Nathaniel watching her, his expression inscrutable. Their eyes locked briefly before the arrival of the car broke the moment.

Just as they prepared to leave, a familiar voice called out.

"Nathaniel, are you free?"

Isabella Davis approached, graceful in a pale green dress, her hair cascading over her shoulders. Her smile was warm, her tone intimate.

Nathaniel glanced at her. "What brings you here?"

"I thought we could have dinner." Her gaze flickered to Evelyn, then the others. "Unless you’re busy?"

"We have plans," he said evenly.

Isabella’s smile dimmed. "Ah. Bad timing, then."

She greeted the others with effortless charm.

Daniel smiled. "Ms. Davis! A pleasure to meet you in person."

"You’re even more stunning than on screen," another added.

Isabella laughed softly, gracious under the praise.

One of the Martin Group employees asked, "Here to see Mr. Martin, Ms. Davis?"
###Chapter 59

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand ballroom, the weight of Nathaniel’s absence pressed down on her. The room glittered with chandeliers and the hum of high society, but all she could think about was the way he had looked at her before storming out.

Isabella’s triumphant smirk from across the room didn’t help.

"Enjoying the party, Evelyn?" Isabella purred, swirling her champagne flute. "Though I suppose it’s not quite the same without Nathaniel by your side."

Evelyn clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms. "He’ll be back."

"Oh, darling," Isabella laughed, a sound like shattering glass. "Men like him don’t come back. Not when they realize what they’ve been missing."

Before Evelyn could retort, Gregory appeared at her elbow, his expression tight. "We have a problem."

She followed his gaze to the entrance, where Edward Martin stood, his cold eyes scanning the crowd. Behind him, Richard and Victoria Martin exchanged hushed words with Sebastian Wilson—Summit Realty’s owner.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. "What are they doing here?"

Gregory’s jaw tightened. "Sabotage."

A murmur rippled through the crowd as Edward took the stage, tapping the microphone. "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us tonight. It seems there’s been a… misunderstanding regarding the Pineview project."

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Edward’s smile was razor-sharp. "Effective immediately, Martin Group is withdrawing its partnership with Mitchell Architects."

Gasps erupted. Evelyn’s vision blurred.

Then, the doors burst open.

Nathaniel strode in, his presence commanding silence. His gaze locked onto Evelyn’s, burning with something she couldn’t name.

"Correction," he said, voice cutting through the room like steel. "Martin Group stands with Mitchell Architects. And anyone who disagrees can take it up with me."

Isabella’s glass slipped from her fingers, shattering on the floor.

Evelyn’s heart pounded.

The game had just changed.

Evelyn glanced at Nathaniel and gave a slight nod. "Well, yes, I was supposed to have dinner with Nathaniel, but since you already have plans, I—"

"Why don't Ms. Mitchell join us? The more, the merrier," suggested the representative from Summit Realty, noticing the tension between Evelyn and Nathaniel. He extended the invitation to please Nathaniel.

Nathaniel remained expressionless, while Evelyn looked to him for approval. "Would that be alright? Nathaniel, I don’t want to impose."

"Not at all, Ms. Mitchell. We'd love for you to come," someone quickly chimed in.

After a brief pause, Nathaniel finally gave a curt nod. "Do as you wish."

"Perfect, then I’ll join you," Evelyn beamed, stepping closer to Nathaniel before turning to Isabella with forced cheerfulness. "Isabella, I didn’t realize you were here too."

Isabella barely managed a response under the expectant gazes of the group. "Yeah," she muttered.

Since they clearly knew each other, the others assumed Isabella’s preferential treatment from Nathaniel stemmed from her connection to Evelyn.

As they prepared to leave, Nathaniel ordered, "Get in the car."

Isabella, standing closest to the vehicle, reached for the backseat door—only for Evelyn to swiftly cut in with a saccharine smile. "Isabella, thank you."

With a subtle smirk directed at Isabella, Evelyn revealed her true intentions, but Isabella remained impassive, refusing to react.

Evelyn gestured for Nathaniel to join them.

Isabella’s cold gaze met Nathaniel’s, but he remained indifferent, sliding into the backseat without a word.

She opted for the passenger seat instead.

Evelyn feigned concern. "Isabella, why don’t you join us back here? It’s hard to talk when you’re up front."

Isabella arched a brow. "Ms. Davis, ever heard the saying 'three’s a crowd'? Besides, we barely know each other. I doubt we have much to discuss."

"Isabella, are you upset? If my presence bothers you, I can switch seats. I thought you wouldn’t mind," Evelyn said sweetly.

"Save the act, Ms. Davis. If you were truly concerned, you wouldn’t have taken the backseat in the first place," Isabella retorted coolly.

Evelyn had succeeded in annoying her, and she wasn’t interested in entertaining her further.

Evelyn turned to Nathaniel with a pout. "Nathaniel, did I do something wrong again?"

"Evelyn, be quiet. I have a headache and need to rest," Nathaniel’s deep, icy voice cut her off.

At the mention of his discomfort, Evelyn immediately fussed. "Nathaniel, are you feeling unwell?"

"No. I just need silence. Understood?"

"Of course. Rest well," she conceded, playing the doting companion.

Isabella, however, couldn’t help but glance at Nathaniel with concern.

Upon arriving at the restaurant, Evelyn followed Nathaniel inside, the two of them drawing admiring glances as they walked in perfect sync.

Throughout dinner, Evelyn effortlessly took on the role of the gracious hostess, charming everyone with her warmth and attentiveness. Her performance only reinforced the assumption that she and Nathaniel were an item.

Isabella, in contrast, remained aloof, barely engaging with the unfamiliar faces around her.

As they left the restaurant, Isabella deliberately lagged behind, intending to avoid sharing a car with Nathaniel and his entourage.

Just as she was about to excuse herself, her phone rang, drawing everyone’s attention.

She answered calmly. "Hello, Gregory?"

"Are you done? I’m nearby. I can pick you up."

"Sure," she replied, giving him the restaurant’s name.

Gregory confirmed, "I’ll be there in five."

"Alright, I’ll wait," she said before hanging up.

Daniel grinned. "Is that Ms. Mitchell’s boyfriend? A woman as stunning as you must have plenty of admirers."

Evelyn’s smile tightened at the compliment directed at Isabella.

Isabella merely smirked, neither confirming nor denying.

The Summit Realty rep added, "Ms. Mitchell’s partner is quite handsome. I assume he’s her boyfriend?"

Isabella stayed silent, so the topic was quickly dropped.

Nathaniel’s gaze sharpened as he spoke in a low, dangerous tone. "Ms. Mitchell has a boyfriend?"

The Summit Realty rep faltered under his glare, unsure how to respond. The others exchanged uneasy glances.

Isabella met Nathaniel’s stare but refused to explain.

Evelyn quickly intervened. "Nathaniel, could you drop me off at the studio later?"

Nathaniel ignored her, his focus locked on Isabella. "Ms. Mitchell, are you not going to answer?"

"Mr. Martin, my personal life isn’t work-related. I don’t owe you an explanation," Isabella replied coolly.

"Personal life?" Nathaniel’s laugh was frosty.

"Isabella—" He started, but before he could continue, Gregory’s car pulled up.

Stepping out, Gregory strode toward Isabella, greeting the Summit Realty rep first.

The rep quickly introduced, "This is Gregory Wilson, Ms. Mitchell’s partner."

After exchanging pleasantries, Gregory turned to Nathaniel with polite respect. "Mr. Martin, I’ve heard much about you."

Nathaniel’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. "Likewise, Mr. Wilson."

No one dared to pry further into their acquaintance.

Gregory stood beside Isabella, his gaze softening as he asked, "You haven’t been eating well. Did you have enough tonight?"

Isabella nodded.

Their easy familiarity spoke volumes.

Daniel grinned. "Mr. Wilson and Ms. Mitchell make a striking pair—both brilliant and beautiful!"

Gregory chuckled. "Thank you, Daniel. Though I should clarify—Ms. Mitchell hasn’t accepted my advances yet."

"Ms. Mitchell deserves an exceptional partner. I hope it works out for you two."

"That’s the plan."

The tension eased as the conversation turned lighthearted.

Evelyn leaned in to whisper to Nathaniel, "Nathaniel, is Gregory really dating Isabella? But she’s still married to you. Has she made up her mind about the divorce?"

Nathaniel’s expression remained unreadable, his eyes cold and distant.

###Chapter 60

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains as Evelyn stretched in bed. Nathaniel had already left for his early meeting, leaving his side of the bed cold. She traced her fingers over the indentation his body had left in the mattress, a bittersweet smile playing on her lips.

Her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. Gabrielle's name flashed across the screen with three missed calls. Evelyn's stomach dropped. Her assistant never called this early unless something was wrong.

"Gabrielle? What's—"

"Evelyn! Thank God you answered!" Gabrielle's voice came in frantic bursts. "The city planning committee just called. They're moving up the review for the waterfront project to today at 2 PM. Something about the mayor's schedule changing."

Evelyn's blood ran cold. The presentation wasn't ready. Not even close. "That's impossible. We had two more weeks!"

"I know, but—"

"Call Gregory. Tell him to meet me at the office in thirty minutes. And get Daniel Carter on the line. We'll need all hands on deck."

She threw back the covers, her mind racing through contingency plans as she dressed in record time. The Martin Group's reputation—and her own—hung in the balance. This project could make or break her career.

The drive to the office passed in a blur. When the elevator doors opened, chaos greeted her. The entire design team huddled around computer screens, voices overlapping in tense exchanges.

Gregory emerged from the crowd, his usually impeccable tie loosened. "We've got problems," he muttered, steering her toward the conference room. "The structural engineer's calculations don't match our latest revisions. And the 3D renderings crashed twice already."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her tablet. "Where's Daniel?"

"On his way. Traffic's a nightmare downtown."

She took a steadying breath. "Okay. New plan. Gabrielle, pull up the original schematics. We'll work backward from there. Gregory, call Dr. Harrison—we might need his medical center blueprints for reference."

As the team scrambled, Evelyn's phone buzzed again. Nathaniel's name appeared this time. Her thumb hovered over the screen. She couldn't face his disappointment right now. Not when she'd promised everything was under control.

The phone stopped ringing. A second later, a text appeared: "Heard about the schedule change. Sending Samuel with the structural files from last quarter. You've got this."

Her throat tightened. Even when she faltered, he had her back. Squaring her shoulders, Evelyn turned to her team. "Alright everyone. Let's show them why Martin Group only works with the best."

The clock ticked toward noon as they worked feverishly. When the final renderings loaded without error at 1:37 PM, the office erupted in cheers. Evelyn allowed herself one moment of relief before gathering her materials.

"Gregory, you're with me. Gabrielle, keep your phone on. We might need last-minute changes."

As they rushed toward the elevators, Evelyn's phone rang again. An unknown number. She almost ignored it until Gregory nudged her. "Could be the committee."

She answered just as the elevator doors closed. "Evelyn Mitchell speaking."

"Ms. Mitchell," purred a familiar feminine voice that sent ice down her spine. "I do hope I'm not interrupting anything important."

Evelyn's grip on her presentation folder turned white-knuckled. "Isabella. What do you want?"

A soft laugh. "Just calling to wish you luck today. Though..." A dramatic pause. "I wonder how the committee will react when they learn your lead architect has been... distracted lately. Personal matters and all that."

The elevator dinged at the lobby. Evelyn stepped out, Gregory close behind, his concerned gaze questioning. She forced her voice steady. "I don't have time for games, Isabella."

"Of course you don't, darling. That's why I took the liberty of sending the committee some... interesting photos. Nathaniel really should be more careful about where he takes his morning meetings."

The line went dead. Evelyn stood frozen in the bustling lobby, the weight of Isabella's threat settling over her like a shroud. Gregory's hand on her arm brought her back.

"Evelyn? We need to go. Now."

She nodded numbly, her mind racing. What had Isabella sent? And more importantly—how much damage had already been done?

As their car pulled away from the curb, Evelyn watched the Martin Group tower shrink in the rearview mirror. Today would either be her greatest triumph... or her most spectacular downfall. And Isabella Davis held all the cards.

Nathaniel didn’t speak a word until the car pulled away.

First, they dropped Isabella off at the recording studio. As she stepped out, she hesitated, then murmured softly, "Nathaniel, are you angry? I know Evelyn’s actions might have upset you, but please, don’t be too harsh on her. Talk to her properly. I’m afraid you might hurt her feelings."

His expression remained icy. His reply was just as cold. "Isabella, don’t concern yourself with this. Focus on your own work, understood?"

"Understood," she conceded, not daring to push further.

As she watched his car disappear down the street, a glint of determination flashed in her eyes. Evelyn, Nathaniel will be mine.

The rest of the afternoon, Nathaniel’s mood was foul. Executives and vice presidents trembled under his sharp criticism, leaving the office in a state of nervous tension.

His chilling voice echoed through the halls.

One vice president emerged from Nathaniel’s office looking like he might cry. He turned to Samuel and whispered, "Mr. Yates, what’s going on with Mr. Martin?"

"Mr. Martin is fine," Samuel replied cautiously. "Best not to speculate. Just do your job well, and you won’t have anything to worry about."

The employees exchanged uneasy glances before burying themselves in their work.

Once they were gone, Samuel exhaled quietly. He straightened his tie and hurried to Nathaniel’s office when summoned.

Then, the phone rang.

Nathaniel’s indifferent voice came through. "Samuel, are you waiting for me to come out and assign your tasks myself?"

Samuel set the phone down and rushed into the office, his nerves frayed.

The tense atmosphere lasted until the end of the workday.

When Nathaniel returned to Pineview Villa, Evelyn still hadn’t come home, and Isabella had dinner plans with her sponsor.

The grand villa was eerily silent, the stillness unsettling. Nathaniel’s handsome face remained cold, his anger simmering beneath the surface.

An hour later, Evelyn finally walked through the door.

She flicked on only the dim entrance light, murmuring, "Alfred didn’t turn on the lights?"

No response came from the butler.

She was about to head upstairs when a deep voice cut through the darkness. "Evelyn, what time is it? Why are you back so late?"

She turned, meeting Nathaniel’s piercing gaze.

Had he been sitting there all this time?

Evelyn answered calmly, "Daniel and I were inspecting the construction site. We had dinner afterward. It’s only seven—not late."

Nathaniel’s expression didn’t change. His cold eyes narrowed slightly as he spoke, his tone sharp. "Then tell me, Evelyn, when is too late? Should I expect you to take Gregory out next, letting everyone assume you’re a couple?"

Evelyn frowned, keeping her composure.

"Gregory is my business partner," she said evenly. "What’s wrong with having dinner with Daniel? What he said was just to clarify our relationship and avoid misunderstandings."

"Clarify what?" Nathaniel’s voice was frosty.

Evelyn let out a humorless laugh. "You let Isabella give everyone the impression you two are dating while implying something between us. How do you think that makes me look?"

She hadn’t wanted to bring up Isabella, but Nathaniel left her no choice.

His brows furrowed slightly. "Evelyn, you’re the only one who thinks that way. Isabella and I have done nothing to suggest otherwise. No one sees us as a couple."

"If I can see how close you two are, so can everyone else," she countered.

"That’s deflection," he accused coldly.

Evelyn paused, then said flatly, "It doesn’t matter."

"Evelyn, we are married. You need to distance yourself from Gregory. Cut ties with him. Whatever he’s invested in your company, I’ll compensate him. End it. No more meetings."

Her eyes flashed with defiance. "Nathaniel, even as my husband, you don’t get to dictate who I associate with. I’ve never asked you to cut anyone out of your life. Gregory and I are just friends."

"Whether you see him as a friend or not, he doesn’t feel the same. As a man, I know his intentions. Evelyn, you’re still my wife."

His words struck a nerve.

Was he implying she was being inappropriate?

And what about him?

She leveled a cold stare at him. "If I asked you to stay away from Isabella, could you? You told me you want a divorce to marry her. You brought her into our home. Nathaniel, have you ever considered my feelings? Do you even remember what being a husband means?"

Nathaniel’s expression darkened at the mention of Isabella. His handsome face remained cold, his silence stretching between them.

Neither would back down.

Evelyn stood firm. Gregory might have feelings for her, but she had made her stance clear, and he had respected it. Compared to Nathaniel and Isabella’s blatant closeness, her friendship with Gregory was perfectly reasonable.

To her, Gregory wasn’t just a partner—he was a trusted friend who had supported her through her darkest times. How could she possibly cut him off?

The standoff lasted for days, their silence thick with tension.

Isabella, though unaware of the details, couldn’t help but smile at their discord.

Three days later, her comeback press conference arrived.

The night before, she sought Nathaniel’s help. "Nathaniel, could you do me a favor? Tomorrow’s my comeback event. I’d love for you to attend with me. Just ten minutes—that’s all. After being gone for a year, I need the media’s attention to restart my career."

Nathaniel hesitated. "I’ll check my schedule."

"I already spoke with Samuel. He said you’re free. Please?" she pressed, her eyes pleading.

A flicker of something crossed his face before he finally nodded.

With Nathaniel’s presence, the event gained instant prestige.

Fans, reporters, and media swarmed the venue, eager to witness Isabella’s return. Her enchanting voice and past popularity had earned her countless admirers.

She and Nathaniel stepped onto the stage together, hand in hand, bathed in camera flashes. With a soft, melodic voice, she thanked her fans before turning to Nathaniel. "The person I’m most grateful for is standing right beside me. Thank you, Nathaniel."

Nathaniel remained stoic, offering no smile, but his striking presence commanded attention.

The crowd erupted in cheers.

Then, a reporter shouted, "Ms. Davis, what’s your relationship with Mr. Martin? Why do you need to thank him?"

"Are you two dating?"

"A year ago, photos surfaced of you two living together. Did you take time off to get married?"

"Did you and Mr. Martin secretly wed?"

The questions came rapid-fire, the excitement in the room reaching a fever pitch.


###Chapter 61

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of our penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. I stretched beneath the silk sheets, my fingers brushing against the cold, empty space beside me. Nathaniel had already left for his early meeting at Martin Group headquarters.

My phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. Gabrielle's name flashed across the screen with three missed calls and a string of urgent texts about the Kensington project revisions. I groaned, rubbing sleep from my eyes. The architectural firm had been swamped since Gregory and I won the commercial district bid last month.

The scent of freshly brewed coffee lured me toward the kitchen where Alfred, our butler, stood arranging breakfast with military precision. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he murmured, pouring steaming dark roast into my favorite porcelain cup. "Mr. Martin asked me to inform you he'll be dining with Mr. Ellsworth at the club tonight."

I nodded absently, scrolling through project blueprints on my tablet. The design needed complete restructuring before our 2 PM client presentation. My stomach twisted at the thought of Nathaniel's business dinner - Thomas Ellsworth had been introducing him to various investors lately, all with eligible daughters.

A sharp knock at the door interrupted my thoughts. Alfred admitted Isabella Davis, looking impossibly chic in a cream Dior suit, her signature vanilla perfume preceding her like a declaration of war. My coffee cup clattered against its saucer.

"Darling," she purred, air-kissing my cheeks. "I was in the neighborhood and thought we might lunch at Le Bernardin. Vanessa's arranging a charity gala and we simply must discuss your involvement." Her crimson nails tapped against her crocodile Birkin. "Nathaniel's already pledged Martin Group's support, of course."

The unspoken challenge hung between us. Isabella had been maneuvering herself back into our lives since returning from Paris, her every interaction with Nathaniel carefully staged for maximum intimacy. Last week's opera incident flashed through my mind - the paparazzi shots of them leaning close in the private box had trended for days.

My phone buzzed again. Gabrielle: Emergency at site. Structural integrity concerns. Media's here.

I stood abruptly, breakfast forgotten. "Rain check, Isabella. Work crisis." I grabbed my briefcase, pausing only to text Nathaniel: We need to talk tonight. No excuses.

The elevator doors slid shut on Isabella's frozen smile. As the car descended, my reflection in the mirrored walls showed a woman bracing for battle on multiple fronts. The Kensington project, Isabella's machinations, Nathaniel's increasingly frequent "business dinners" - all pieces in a dangerous game where I refused to be the sacrificial pawn.

The lobby doors opened to a wall of flashing cameras. Reporters shouted questions about the Martin Group's rumored merger with Davis Holdings. I straightened my shoulders and stepped into the storm.

Isabella's lips pressed into a thin line as she cast a fleeting glance at Nathaniel. Lowering her voice, she murmured, "Today's press conference is about my comeback. Let's keep the focus on my new projects. As for my personal life, I'd rather not discuss it publicly. If there's any news worth sharing, my fans will be the first to know."

Though her words seemed to dismiss further questions, they only stoked the flames of speculation.

Meanwhile, in her office, Evelyn watched the live broadcast unfold. The screen showed Nathaniel, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, standing beside Isabella, who shimmered in an elegant gown and flawless makeup. Their proximity was undeniable, and the whispers about their relationship grew louder.

Evelyn exhaled sharply and shut her laptop, unwilling to dwell on it.

Just then, the office door creaked open, and Gregory stepped inside, his gaze locking onto hers.

"Evelyn," he said, frustration lacing his tone, "what is Nathaniel thinking? Showing up at Isabella's event like that—it's practically a public declaration."

Evelyn shrugged, forcing a casual smile. "He can do as he pleases."

"Evelyn, he's treating you horribly. Why stay in this marriage?"

She met his eyes calmly. "I appreciate your concern, Gregory, but some things are more complicated than they seem. Marriage isn't just about two people."

She wanted a divorce, but Nathaniel's influence—both from his family and his own power—made it impossible to simply walk away. The Martin family had a tight grip on her, and she couldn't just sever ties without consequences.

Gregory opened his mouth to argue, but Evelyn gently cut him off. "I'm fine, really. Don't pity me. Life isn't perfect, and every experience shapes us."

Her smile left him speechless, his expression tinged with sorrow. "Evelyn, I just wish you'd stay away from him. I'm worried about you..."

Backstage at Isabella's event, Nathaniel strode out with a stormy expression.

Isabella hurried after him. "Nathaniel, please, let me explain—"

He stopped abruptly, turning to face her. Their eyes met, and his voice was icy. "Isabella, today was a one-time favor. I tolerate your dramatics, but I won't tolerate deception."

Without another word, he walked away, deaf to her pleas.

Tears welled in Isabella's eyes as she stood alone.

Just moments earlier, a reporter had asked, "Mr. Martin, can you clarify your relationship with Ms. Davis? Are the rumors of your marriage true?"

Nathaniel's response had been cool. "We've been friends for years. Today is about Isabella's achievements, not baseless gossip. Fabricated stories only distract from what matters."

With that, he left the stage, leaving Isabella seething.

She blamed Evelyn. If Evelyn hadn't clung to Nathaniel, she wouldn't have needed to manipulate the press into thinking they were together.

It was all Evelyn's fault. She was the obstacle standing between Isabella and Nathaniel.

With a dark resolve, Isabella vowed to make Evelyn suffer.

Her agent, Vanessa, caught up to her. "Isabella, is Mr. Martin upset?"

"No," Isabella replied smoothly, forcing a smile. "He had work to attend to. Let's continue."

Returning to the stage, she captivated her fans with a familiar melody, her voice as enchanting as ever, quickly overshadowing the earlier drama.

Videos and photos of the incident flooded the internet, skyrocketing to the top of trending searches.

Meanwhile, at the Martin estate, Edward nearly lost his temper when he saw the viral content.

Slamming his fist on the table, he growled, "What is Nathaniel doing? Does he really intend to marry that woman?"

In a rage, he ordered Winston to summon Nathaniel immediately. However, Samuel intercepted the call, explaining that Nathaniel was in a meeting.

"Tell him to come home as soon as he's done," Edward snapped.

"Understood."

Richard tried to calm his father. "Dad, let's not jump to conclusions. We'll talk to Nathaniel directly."

"Talk? What's there to talk about? The evidence is right there! He refuses to listen to anyone!" Edward fumed, his anger directed squarely at Nathaniel.

Desperate for answers, he called Evelyn, hoping for clarity. But her composed response only deepened his frustration.

An hour later, Nathaniel finished his meeting, and Samuel quickly briefed him on the online uproar and the family's summons.

Glancing at his phone, Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Did I hire you to sit around? Handle these rumors."

His gaze was glacial, laced with unmistakable displeasure.

Samuel nodded gravely. "Mr. Martin, my apologies. I'll take care of it immediately."

He swiftly organized a team to suppress the news about Nathaniel and Isabella.

He had hesitated earlier, unsure of Nathaniel's stance. His attendance at the event might have signaled approval.

But seeing Nathaniel's anger, Samuel realized his mistake.

Returning to his office, Nathaniel called home, but Edward had already taken his medication and gone to bed.

Richard answered, concern evident. "What happened? How did you end up in this mess with Isabella?"

"Dad, the press twists everything. I was just supporting a friend."

"Handle it properly. Don't let your grandfather worry."

"I know."

Ending the call, Nathaniel leaned back in his chair, silent for a long moment.

He stared at his phone, but it remained stubbornly quiet—no calls, no messages.

His handsome features twisted into a scowl as his mood soured further.

The tension lingered until he left the office. Sitting in the car, he turned to Samuel, his voice frosty. "Did Evelyn contact you today?"

Samuel hesitated, unsure what answer Nathaniel wanted.

Meeting his gaze in the rearview mirror, he ventured carefully, "Mr. Martin, are you asking if Mrs. Martin reacted to the news?"

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable.

Realizing his mistake, Samuel quickly added, "Apologies, Mr. Martin. Mrs. Martin didn't reach out to me or visit the company today. I don't know her reaction."
###Chapter 62

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, blinking against the light. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She studied his face—the sharp line of his jaw, the faint shadow of stubble. Even in sleep, he exuded an air of quiet authority.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory.

"Meeting at 10. Client wants revisions. Urgent."

Evelyn sighed. Another fire to put out. She slipped out of bed carefully, not wanting to wake Nathaniel.

Downstairs, Alfred was already setting the table for breakfast. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted with a slight bow.

"Morning, Alfred," she replied, pouring herself a cup of coffee. The rich aroma filled her senses, sharpening her mind.

Nathaniel appeared moments later, dressed impeccably in a tailored suit. "You're up early," he remarked, pressing a kiss to her temple.

"Work never sleeps," she quipped, though her tone was light.

His expression turned serious. "You’ve been pushing yourself too hard."

She met his gaze. "I have to. This project is important."

He hesitated, then nodded. "Just don’t forget to take care of yourself."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "I won’t."

At the office, Gabrielle handed her a stack of files. "The client’s notes are highlighted. They’re not happy with the layout."

Evelyn flipped through the pages, scanning the comments. "They want more open space?"

Gabrielle nodded. "And they’re insisting on a rooftop garden."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "That wasn’t in the original plan."

Gregory strode in, his expression grim. "We have two days to make the changes."

Her stomach tightened. "Two days?"

He ran a hand through his hair. "They’re threatening to pull out if we don’t comply."

Evelyn clenched her jaw. "Fine. Let’s get to work."

Hours passed in a blur of sketches, revisions, and heated discussions. By late afternoon, Evelyn’s temples throbbed. She leaned back in her chair, rubbing her eyes.

Gabrielle placed a fresh cup of coffee in front of her. "You need a break."

Evelyn shook her head. "Not yet."

Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was Nathaniel.

"Dinner tonight? Just us."

She hesitated, glancing at the mountain of work still left. But the thought of spending time with him, away from the chaos, was too tempting.

"Yes. 8 PM?"

"Perfect."

As she set her phone down, a new email notification popped up. The sender’s name made her blood run cold.

Isabella Davis.

The subject line was simple: "We need to talk."

Evelyn’s fingers hovered over the keyboard. Her heart pounded. What could Isabella possibly want now?

Before she could open it, Gregory called her into another meeting.

She exhaled sharply, saving the email for later. But the unease lingered, a shadow at the edge of her thoughts.

Something was coming. And she wasn’t sure she was ready for it.

"She didn't show up. Send someone to track her."

"Understood."

Samuel Yates knew exactly what Nathaniel wanted—eyes on Evelyn at all times. The moment he dropped his boss off at Pineview Villa, he dispatched a team to follow her discreetly.

Meanwhile, Evelyn stepped out of the elevator into the dimly lit underground garage, heels clicking against concrete. She was mere steps from her car when three men materialized from the shadows, blocking her path.

Her expression remained impassive as she assessed them.

One smirked, flashing yellowed teeth. "Hey gorgeous, how about some fun with us?"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her keys. "I don't know you."

The leader chuckled, stepping closer. "You do now. Come for a drink. We'll make it worth your while."

Her pulse spiked, but her voice stayed level. "If it's money you want, name your price."

They exchanged glances. This wasn't about robbery.

"Enough talking." The man grabbed her wrist. "You're coming with us."

Evelyn twisted free, scanning the garage for help.

One thug snorted. "She's looking for a hero. Grab her already—we're on the clock."

On the clock. A paid job. Someone had sent them.

Her hands instinctively cradled her stomach as she feinted left, then bolted right. But three against one were impossible odds.

Fingers tangled in her hair, yanking viciously. "Bitch thinks she can run?"

Pain exploded across her scalp. "I'll double whatever they're paying you!"

A slap cracked against her cheek, stars bursting behind her eyes.

"Pretty thing like you... maybe we sample the goods first—"

"Not here, idiot!"

They dragged her toward a black van. Once inside, I'm dead. She stomped a heel into a kneecap, earning a howl. The second man backhanded her so hard her vision grayed.

Then—miraculously—a flashlight beam cut through the gloom. "Everything alright here?"

Security!

"Help me!" Evelyn screamed.

The men hesitated, then fled, tires screeching.

Her legs gave out. Something warm trickled down her thighs. No no no—

"Miss? Miss!"

Darkness swallowed her.

Beeping machines greeted Evelyn when she awoke. White walls. Hospital.

Caroline Sullivan materialized beside her, pressing her back onto the pillows. "Don't move. The baby's stable, but you need monitoring."

Stable. She exhaled shakily.

"Who did this?" Caroline demanded.

Evelyn recounted the attack in clipped sentences. The security guard had called the ambulance.

Her phone was shattered, so she borrowed Caroline's to call Pineview Villa. Alfred answered.

"Evelyn, it's nearly midnight. Where are you?"

She swallowed. "Tell Nathaniel I'm staying at Edward Martin's tonight."

Nathaniel's voice cut in, icy. "You'd rather be with Gregory than your husband?"

Her nails bit into her palms. Let him think what he wanted. She hung up without explaining, then called Edward. The old man covered for her without question.

Nathaniel stared at the dead phone. Was this retaliation over today's tabloid photos with Isabella?

Jealousy doesn't suit you, Evelyn.

Dawn painted the hospital room gold when Evelyn's new phone buzzed.

A voice hissed through the receiver: "Isabella Davis met with two ex-cons yesterday. Paid them 50K each."

Evelyn's knuckles whitened around the device.

"Boss... when are you coming back to the company?"

"When I do," she said softly, "there will be consequences for incompetence."

The line went dead.

Thirty minutes later, as Caroline packed her discharge papers, Evelyn stood. "Take me to Isabella's studio."

They arrived as Isabella was leaving, designer sunglasses perched on her nose. Her smile faltered for a nanosecond.

"Evelyn! What a... surprise."

Evelyn stepped into her personal space, voice lethally calm.

"We need to talk."
###Chapter 63

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the marble floors as Evelyn paced the length of their penthouse. Her fingers trembled slightly as she clutched the latest architectural blueprints. The weight of Nathaniel's deception still pressed heavily against her ribs, making each breath feel like swallowing shards of glass.

"Madam?" Alfred appeared in the doorway, his polished shoes silent against the hardwood. "Mr. Martin has just pulled into the driveway."

Evelyn's throat tightened. She hadn't seen Nathaniel since their explosive argument three days prior, when Isabella's pregnancy announcement had shattered their fragile reconciliation. The memory of his stunned expression - those storm-gray eyes widening in genuine shock - still haunted her. Was it possible he hadn't known?

The elevator pinged. Evelyn straightened her spine as Nathaniel stepped into the foyer, his tailored suit rumpled from what appeared to be consecutive all-nighters. Dark circles shadowed his eyes, and the usual crisp citrus scent of his cologne had been replaced by something sharper - whiskey and regret.

"You're home." Her voice came out colder than intended.

Nathaniel's gaze flickered to the packed suitcase by the staircase. "Going somewhere?"

"To my mother's. I need space to think." Evelyn watched his jaw tighten. "Unless you have something to say about Isabella's little revelation?"

His hands clenched at his sides. "I swear to you, Evelyn, I had no idea about the pregnancy until that moment. The last time Isabella and I—"

"Save it." She held up a hand, the diamond of her wedding band catching the light. "Your secretary just forwarded your calendar. You have a meeting with her tomorrow at the Regent Hotel. Care to explain?"

Nathaniel's phone buzzed. The screen lit up with a text preview: "We need to talk about our baby. Meet me at—"

Evelyn's vision blurred. Without thinking, she hurled her tablet across the room. It shattered against the abstract painting Isabella had gifted them last Christmas. "Get out."

"Let me explain—"

"Now!" Her scream echoed through the vaulted ceilings. Somewhere downstairs, a door slammed.

Nathaniel reached for her, but Evelyn twisted away. The movement sent her stumbling into the console table, where a framed wedding photo teetered and fell. Glass exploded across the floor like their fractured marriage.

Three sharp knocks interrupted them. Samuel Yates stood in the doorway, his usually composed face ashen. "Sir, urgent call from Dr. Harrison. Your grandfather's collapsed at the corporate office."

The blood drained from Nathaniel's face. "Is he—"

"They're resuscitating him now. The car's waiting."

For one suspended moment, Nathaniel's gaze locked with Evelyn's. In his eyes, she saw the same terrified boy who'd clung to her during his grandfather's first heart attack years ago. The boy she'd fallen in love with beneath the maple trees at Princeton.

Then the mask slid back into place. "We'll finish this later," he said quietly, following Samuel out the door.

Evelyn sank onto the staircase, her fingers brushing the broken glass. Outside, thunder rumbled despite the clear sky - a perfect metaphor for the storm brewing in her chest. Somewhere between the lies and the betrayals, she'd lost sight of where Nathaniel ended and the deception began.

Her phone buzzed with an unknown number. The attached photo showed Isabella's perfectly manicured hand resting on a barely-there baby bump, a diamond bracelet glinting at her wrist - the same design Nathaniel had gifted Evelyn on their first anniversary.

The accompanying message froze her blood: "He'll always come back to me. Just wait until he sees the paternity results."

Her porcelain face was icy, devoid of color. Evelyn didn’t bother responding to Isabella. She strode straight toward her, lifted her hand, and delivered a sharp slap across Isabella’s cheek.

The crack of skin against skin reverberated through the air.

The force was brutal—a vivid red mark bloomed instantly on Isabella’s flawless skin.

Isabella’s eyes widened in shock. She pressed a trembling hand to her stinging cheek. "What the hell, Evelyn? What did I do to you?"

"You know exactly what you did. Cut the act, Isabella." Evelyn’s voice was a blade, cold and precise. "Consider this a warning. If you value your precious reputation, stay the hell away from me. Don’t test me again."

Her gaze was a silent threat, sharp enough to draw blood.

Isabella’s lips quivered. "I have no idea what you’re talking about! You just assaulted me. Do you realize what Nathaniel will do when he finds out?" Her fingers curled protectively over the throbbing mark, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.

Vanessa, Isabella’s manager, rushed forward, shielding her from Evelyn’s wrath. "Ms. Mitchell, this is unacceptable! We can discuss whatever issue you have like civilized people." She raised her voice deliberately, drawing the attention of nearby onlookers.

Evelyn’s lips curled into a mocking smile. "Oh, by all means, shout louder. Let’s tell everyone how the beloved Isabella Davis tried to wreck my marriage with Nathaniel. Would you like that?"

Vanessa’s face paled, her mouth snapping shut.

Isabella’s composure shattered. "Nathaniel doesn’t love you! If you had any dignity, you’d have divorced him by now!"

Evelyn tilted her head, feigning indifference. "I don’t care. As long as we’re married, you’ll never be more than his dirty little secret. And if I get pregnant?" She leaned in, her whisper venomous. "You’ll never have him."

Isabella’s breath hitched. "You wouldn’t dare! You’re insane!"

Vanessa gripped Isabella’s arm, a silent plea for restraint, but Isabella’s fury was uncontrollable.

Evelyn smirked. "Insane? Maybe. But at least I’m the one sharing his bed every night. What does that make you?"

Without another word, Evelyn turned on her heel and walked away.

She’d accomplished what she came for. If anything had happened to the baby, she wouldn’t have stopped at a slap.

Isabella would pay.

Watching Evelyn’s retreating figure, Isabella trembled with rage. Vanessa murmured urgently, "Isabella, ignore her. We need to salvage your image. The rest can wait."

Isabella exhaled sharply, tugging her hair forward to conceal the mark. "Cancel the investor meeting. I’m going to Martin Group."

Vanessa nodded. No deal was worth more than Nathaniel’s influence.

Nathaniel’s office door swung open without warning. Isabella stumbled in, tears streaming down her face. "Nathaniel..."

His brow furrowed. "What happened?"

She brushed her hair aside, revealing the livid bruise. "It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have let you come to my meeting. Evelyn misunderstood. She stormed into my studio, said horrible things..." Her voice broke. "She told me she’s going to have your child. So what am I, Nathaniel? Just tell me, and I’ll leave. I won’t interfere."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "Evelyn hit you?"

Isabella didn’t deny it. "If this gets out, my career is over. She could’ve just talked to me. But she humiliated me instead."

His jaw tightened. "I’ll handle it."

She clutched his sleeve. "I don’t want to cause trouble. But if you want me gone, just say it."

Nathaniel grabbed his phone and dialed Evelyn.

She answered, voice calm. "Yes?"

"Where are you?"

"Home. Why?"

"Stay there." He hung up without another word.

Pineview Villa loomed ahead as Nathaniel’s car pulled up, Isabella in tow.

Evelyn was waiting, her posture rigid, face unreadable.

Nathaniel didn’t waste time. "Did you do this?" He gestured to Isabella’s cheek.

Evelyn met his gaze without flinching. "Yes."

"Why? Because I attended her meeting?"

"This isn’t about you." Her tone was glacial. "Ask her what she did."

Isabella’s tears fell harder. "I didn’t do anything! Vanessa was there—she saw everything!"

Evelyn scoffed. "You think I’d waste my time slapping you for no reason?"

Nathaniel’s voice dropped dangerously. "Apologize. Now."

Evelyn’s laugh was hollow. "For what? She deserved it."

"You hit her. You apologize."

Evelyn’s fingers curled into fists. She could tell him the truth—about the parking lot, the threats—but what was the point? He’d always choose Isabella.

"Never."

Nathaniel grabbed her wrist, his grip bruising. "Evelyn—"

She winced, pain flaring where yesterday’s assailant had wrenched her arm. "Go ahead," she whispered. "Slap me back. Would that make you happy?"

His grip loosened slightly, but his eyes remained stormy.

Evelyn yanked free. "I won’t apologize. Not to her. Not to you."

She turned toward the stairs, but Nathaniel’s voice stopped her.

"You’ve changed."

She paused, her back to him. "No. You just never saw me."

Then she walked away, leaving the tension thick enough to choke on.
###Chapter 64

The moment Nathaniel stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, the air shifted. His presence alone commanded attention, his broad shoulders squared with determination. His dark eyes, usually so unreadable, flickered with something Evelyn couldn’t quite place—anger? Regret?

She stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her fingers tracing the delicate embroidery of her dress. The evening was supposed to be a celebration—Edward Martin’s birthday—but tension coiled in the air like a snake ready to strike.

Isabella had arrived earlier, draped in a gown that shimmered like liquid gold, her smile sharp enough to cut glass. She had positioned herself near Nathaniel within minutes, her laughter too bright, her touches too deliberate.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted.

"You look stunning," a voice murmured beside her. She turned to find Gregory, his usual easygoing demeanor replaced with quiet concern. "But you’re gripping that glass like you’re about to throw it at someone."

She forced a laugh, loosening her fingers. "Just tired."

Gregory arched a brow. "Tired? Or ready to set something on fire?"

Before she could respond, Nathaniel’s voice cut through the hum of conversation. "Evelyn."

Her name on his lips sent a jolt through her. He stood a few feet away, his expression unreadable. "A word?"

Isabella’s smirk was unmistakable as Evelyn walked past her.

The moment they stepped into the study, Nathaniel closed the door behind them. The silence was suffocating.

"You’ve been avoiding me," he said, his voice low.

She crossed her arms. "You’ve been busy."

His jaw tightened. "That’s not an answer."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "What do you want, Nathaniel?"

For a heartbeat, he just stared at her, his gaze burning into hers. Then, in two strides, he was in front of her, his hands framing her face.

"I want you," he growled, his breath warm against her lips. "Only you."

Her pulse roared in her ears.

And then—

A sharp knock shattered the moment.

"Mr. Martin," Samuel’s voice came through the door, urgent. "There’s been an incident with the merger documents. They need you downstairs immediately."

Nathaniel cursed under his breath, his grip on her tightening briefly before he let go. "This isn’t over," he muttered, his eyes dark with promise.

As he strode out, Evelyn pressed a hand to her racing heart.

One thing was certain—nothing about tonight would go as planned.

Her porcelain features were serene, but the depth of emotion in her eyes was unfathomable.

She always appeared so composed. Those clear, innocent eyes held a quiet strength, yet Nathaniel felt an invisible chasm between them.

Their gazes locked. In that moment, Nathaniel felt a sharp pang of something raw—hurt, regret, perhaps both.

Isabella’s voice cut through the tension. "Nathaniel, let it go. It was just a slap. I’m fine. There’s no need to argue with Evelyn over this. I don’t want to come between you."

She clutched his arm, her plea soft but firm. Evelyn watched her, and Isabella recoiled slightly, as if burned by the intensity of her stare.

Evelyn said nothing. She turned on her heel and ascended the stairs without another word.

Nathaniel stared after her retreating figure, an unsettling weight settling in his chest.

Evelyn shut the bedroom door behind her, and only then did the dam break.

She could wipe the tears away, but she couldn’t stop them.

She had believed Nathaniel loved Isabella. Even if they hadn’t divorced, she had convinced herself his heart had always belonged to someone else.

But this wasn’t sustainable. If Isabella could orchestrate one attack, she could do it again. The baby was growing inside her, and Evelyn’s attachment deepened with each passing day. For the child’s safety, she needed to end this—now.

Resolute, she picked up her phone and dialed Edward.

She didn’t blame Nathaniel. "Grandfather, I’m sorry. Despite our efforts, Nathaniel and I… we can’t make this work. Even if this marriage was meant to unite the Martins and the Mitchells, I can’t continue."

"Is it because of him and Isabella—?"

"No. It’s not about them. I’m unhappy. The doctor said the baby needs me to be healthy—emotionally and physically. For their sake, I need this divorce."

She knew Edward cared for her and the child. He would understand.

And he did.

"Alright," Edward said, his voice heavy but firm. "If that’s what you need, I support you. Your well-being—and the baby’s—comes first. I’m sorry Nathaniel and this family failed you."

"Grandfather, don’t say that. You once told me I’d always be part of the Martin family, even if Nathaniel and I divorced. So how could you have failed me? This is simply the path fate has set for us."

She soothed him until his laughter returned, soft but genuine.

Once Edward agreed, he informed Richard and Victoria the next morning. They arranged for both families to gather at Martin Manor that evening.

The dining hall was filled with quiet tension as the two families sat together.

Edward spoke first. "Thank you for coming. There’s something we need to discuss."

William, ever respectful, leaned forward. "What is it, Sir Martin?"

Beside him, Margaret exchanged a glance with Sophia, curiosity flickering in their eyes. Richard and Victoria remained solemn—they already knew.

Evelyn and Nathaniel sat beside Edward, the picture of harmony—until the truth shattered it.

Edward continued, "Evelyn and Nathaniel postponed their divorce for the sake of the Martin Group. But they’ve reached an impasse. After speaking with Richard, I’ve agreed they should part ways. The company is stable now—this won’t affect it."

Silence.

William and Margaret stiffened.

"You’re… allowing this?" William asked carefully.

"Yes. They should have the freedom to choose their own paths. As elders, we can’t force them. That said, I hope our families remain close regardless."

Margaret’s lips thinned. "Sir Martin, I can’t believe you’d agree so easily. If they’re still married, shouldn’t they try to reconcile? Have you considered Evelyn’s future?"

Nathaniel said nothing, his expression stormy. His gaze flicked to Evelyn—calm, unreadable.

Had she known this was coming?

His jaw tightened.

Evelyn met his eyes briefly before addressing the table. "I stand with Grandfather. Nathaniel and I have wanted this for a while. Delaying it won’t change the outcome. I’m ready to move forward."

"Evelyn!" Margaret snapped.

Edward held up a hand. "Evelyn deserves happiness. After the divorce, she may no longer be Nathaniel’s wife, but she will always be my granddaughter."

William stayed silent. Richard assured them Evelyn would always be cared for.

But the air was thick with unease.

Margaret’s voice was icy. "Sir Martin, Evelyn doesn’t understand the consequences of this."

"Please, reconsider," William added.

Evelyn remained still, her composure unshaken.

Nathaniel finally spoke, his tone clipped. "We’ll think about it."

The tension lingered long after the meal ended.

On the way out, Margaret shot Evelyn a cold look. "Come see me tomorrow."

Then she ushered Sophia and William into their car and left.

Evelyn exhaled. She had no real home in Mayby anymore. She wanted to leave.

The drive back to Pineview Villa was silent.

But when they arrived, Nathaniel didn’t move. His hands gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white.

He turned to her, his voice low. "Evelyn. Did you convince Grandfather to agree to this?"

She met his gaze. "Yes."

"Why?"

"Because this isn’t healthy—for any of us. You said divorce was between us, but I can’t keep pretending."

Nathaniel went rigid.

Fury flashed in his eyes. He shoved the car door open and strode away without another word.

Evelyn watched his retreating figure, her vision blurring.

But this was for the best.

He didn’t love her. Their marriage had been built on obligation.

It was time to let go.

###Chapter 65

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of our penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. I stretched beneath the silk sheets, my fingers brushing against the cold space where Nathaniel should have been. Again.

My phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. Gabrielle's name flashed across the screen with three missed calls and a string of urgent texts about the Montgomery project. I groaned, rubbing sleep from my eyes. Another crisis before breakfast.

The scent of freshly brewed coffee led me to the kitchen where Alfred stood like a silent sentinel, his gloved hands presenting a steaming cup exactly how I liked it. "Madam," he murmured with a slight bow. "Mr. Martin left early for the office. He asked me to inform you about tonight's gala at the Grand Hyatt."

I nearly choked on my coffee. "What gala?"

"The annual Martin Group charity event, madam. Mr. Martin RSVP'd for both of you last month." Alfred's expression remained professionally blank, but I caught the subtle disapproval in his tone. "Your emerald gown has been pressed and prepared."

Of course Nathaniel hadn't mentioned it. Lately, our conversations consisted of clipped sentences and missed connections. I scrolled through my calendar app - nothing. Typical. My husband had become a master at scheduling our lives without consulting me.

My phone buzzed again. This time, Nathaniel's name appeared. "Emergency board meeting. Can't make lunch. See you at the gala tonight." No greeting. No apology. Just facts.

I stared at the message, my thumb hovering over the keyboard. Part of me wanted to fire back something equally cold. Instead, I typed a simple "Okay" and tossed my phone into my bag. The screen cracked against my keys. Perfect.

The drive to the office was a blur of honking taxis and construction detours. Downtown was undergoing another transformation, steel skeletons rising where old brick buildings once stood. I wondered if anyone would remember what used to be there. The thought made my chest tighten.

Gabrielle pounced the moment I stepped off the elevator. "Thank God you're here! The Montgomery clients are furious about the revised blueprints. They claim we removed the rooftop garden without approval." She thrust a stack of papers into my hands, her eyes wide with panic. "And Mr. Wilson has been calling every fifteen minutes."

I sighed, flipping through the documents. "Because we did remove it. Their structural engineer said the building couldn't support the weight. I emailed them last week."

"Apparently Mr. Montgomery never saw that email. His wife is threatening to pull the entire project." Gabrielle bit her lip. "They're waiting in Conference Room B."

The morning dissolved into damage control - placating angry clients, reworking designs, and fielding calls from Gregory about our dwindling profit margins. By noon, my temples throbbed with the beginnings of a migraine.

I was massaging my forehead when my office door swung open without warning. Nathaniel stood in the doorway, his tailored suit immaculate, his expression unreadable. My breath caught despite myself.

"We need to talk," he said quietly. "Alone."

Gabrielle scurried out, closing the door behind her. Nathaniel waited until her footsteps faded before speaking. "Isabella's back in town."

The name hit me like a physical blow. Isabella Davis - Nathaniel's first love, the woman whose shadow I'd spent our entire marriage trying to escape. I forced my voice steady. "And?"

"She'll be at the gala tonight." His jaw tightened. "I thought you should hear it from me first."

I turned to face the window, watching the sunlight glint off skyscrapers. "How thoughtful." The words came out sharper than intended.

Nathaniel moved closer, his cologne wrapping around me - sandalwood and something uniquely him. "Evelyn..."

"Don't." I held up a hand. "We have clients waiting, and I'm sure you have meetings." I met his gaze in the glass reflection. "We'll put on our happy faces tonight like we always do."

For a long moment, he didn't move. Then, with a quiet sigh, he turned and left without another word. The door clicked shut behind him, the sound final.

My phone buzzed again. Unknown number. I almost ignored it until the preview text appeared: "Looking forward to seeing you tonight, Evelyn. It's been too long. -Isabella"

The screen blurred as my vision swam. I gripped the edge of my desk, the polished wood cool beneath my fingertips. The game had changed. And I wasn't sure I remembered how to play.

The morning sun cast long shadows as Evelyn stepped through the gates of Mitchell Manor. Her chest tightened with each step, knowing exactly why her family opposed her divorce from Nathaniel.

In the manicured gardens, she crossed paths with Sophia. Both pretended not to notice each other until Sophia suddenly spoke. "You're really going through with the divorce?"

"Yes." Evelyn's voice held steady.

Sophia's perfectly shaped brows knitted together. "But why? First you claimed Nathaniel wanted it, now Grandfather Martin agrees? This was your doing, wasn't it?"

"Sooner or later, it was inevitable. Better now than later." Evelyn kept her tone measured.

"Mother's furious," Sophia warned. "Father too. I'm barely keeping her temper in check. You should be more considerate."

Evelyn gave her sister a detached glance. Despite sharing blood, they might as well have been strangers. Without another word, she continued toward the house.

The moment Evelyn entered the grand living room, a porcelain teacup shattered against the wall where her head had been seconds before.

Margaret Mitchell's finger trembled as she pointed accusingly. "Have you lost your mind? The Mitchells are struggling, and you'd throw away our connection to the Martins? After everything we've done for you?"

"Grandfather Martin assured me the business ties would remain," Evelyn countered.

William Mitchell scoffed. "And you believe that? Go back and tell him you've changed your mind. Say it was temporary madness."

"My decision is final." Evelyn's voice didn't waver.

Margaret's eyes turned glacial. "Then you leave us no choice." She snatched up her phone. "Your grandmother will hear about this ingratitude."

Evelyn's breath caught. Beatrice was the only family member who'd ever truly loved her. "You wouldn't."

"Try me," Margaret hissed. "No divorce, or you'll never see her again."

Sophia chose that moment to intervene. "Mother, this isn't right. Grandmother shouldn't be used as leverage."

"She's a Mitchell first!" Margaret snapped. "She'll obey, or face the consequences."

Evelyn left the manor shaking with rage. How could her own mother threaten to cut her off from the only person who'd ever shown her unconditional love?

That evening, Nathaniel maintained an icy silence in their shared bedroom. Evelyn longed to explain, but what was there to say? She'd made her choice.

The next morning, Sophia's call came like a thunderclap. "Mother used your name to sabotage Isabella. She bribed Isabella's new assistant to arrange an 'accident.' This is your fault. If you'd just stay married—"

"Wait," Evelyn interrupted, blood running cold. "Margaret framed me for attacking Isabella?"

"Exactly. Handle it before Nathaniel finds out and destroys us all."

The line went dead. Evelyn stared at her phone, mind racing. She'd never harm Isabella, despite their rivalry. And if Nathaniel discovered the Mitchells' involvement...

She had to warn Isabella without exposing her family.

Meanwhile, at the photo studio, Isabella examined the mysterious package her agent handed her. "I didn't order anything."

Inside lay a single note. As Isabella read it, her face drained of color. "Where's the new assistant?" she demanded.

Vanessa checked the security footage. "Gone. Left in a hurry twenty minutes ago. All her credentials were fake."

Isabella crumpled the warning note. "This has Evelyn written all over it. She wants me gone."

"But if Evelyn orchestrated the plot," Vanessa reasoned, "why would she send a warning? And if Nathaniel doesn't believe you..."

The question hung in the air: Who really sent the note?
###Chapter 66

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She traced the sharp line of his jaw with her fingertips, marveling at how peaceful he looked.

Last night had been… intense.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Mrs. Martin?" Alfred’s voice was muffled through the wood. "Mr. Edward has requested your presence in the study."

Evelyn frowned. Edward rarely summoned her directly. Something must be wrong.

She slipped out of bed, careful not to wake Nathaniel, and dressed quickly. The mansion was eerily quiet as she made her way to the study.

Edward sat behind his desk, his expression unreadable. Winston stood beside him, his usual composed demeanor replaced with tension.

"Evelyn," Edward greeted, his voice grave. "Sit down."

Her pulse quickened. "What’s going on?"

Edward slid a folder across the desk. "This arrived early this morning."

Evelyn opened it, her breath catching as she scanned the contents. Legal documents—divorce papers, signed by Nathaniel.

Her hands trembled. "This—this can’t be real."

Edward’s gaze darkened. "It is. And there’s more."

Winston handed her another document. A restraining order, filed against her by Nathaniel.

Evelyn’s vision blurred. "Why would he do this?"

Edward sighed. "I don’t know. But we need to act fast."

The door burst open. Nathaniel strode in, his expression cold. "Evelyn."

She stood, clutching the papers. "What is this?"

His jaw clenched. "Exactly what it looks like."

"You’re divorcing me?" Her voice cracked.

Nathaniel’s gaze flickered to Edward before hardening again. "It’s for the best."

Evelyn stepped back, shaking her head. "No. You don’t get to do this without an explanation."

A smirk twisted his lips. "You really don’t know?"

She froze.

Then, from the hallway, a familiar laugh echoed.

Isabella stepped into the room, her arm looping possessively through Nathaniel’s. "Oh, Evelyn. Did you really think he’d choose you in the end?"

The world tilted.

Evelyn’s knees buckled, but before she could fall, strong hands caught her.

"Get out." Edward’s voice was steel.

Nathaniel didn’t move. "This is my house."

"Not anymore." Edward snapped his fingers. Winston stepped forward, flanked by two security guards.

Isabella’s smirk faltered. "You can’t—"

"Escort them out," Edward ordered.

As Nathaniel was dragged away, his eyes locked with Evelyn’s—filled with something she couldn’t decipher. Regret? Anger?

Or worse—indifference.

The door slammed shut.

Silence.

Then Edward exhaled sharply. "Evelyn, listen to me carefully. This isn’t over."

She stared at him, numb.

"Because," he continued, his voice low, "Nathaniel didn’t sign those papers."

Her breath hitched. "What?"

Edward’s lips thinned. "Someone forged his signature."

The room spun.

And in that moment, Evelyn realized—this wasn’t just a betrayal.

It was a war.

The agent voiced their concerns, hoping Isabella would give it serious thought.

Isabella remained silent, pressing her lips together, her expression unreadable.

The note was brief—only a single line: "There's an issue with the new assistant. Ignore it at your own peril."

With no concrete evidence linking Evelyn to the matter, Isabella had no choice but to keep her suspicions to herself and act as though nothing was amiss.

After handling the situation, Evelyn also sent a message to her mother: "What you did in my name doesn’t just endanger me—it risks dragging the entire Mitchell family down with me."

Margaret didn’t respond, but Evelyn knew she had seen it.

Life returned to normal. The project had officially begun, with the exterior and landscape designs approved. Evelyn adjusted the construction timeline and addressed any discrepancies that arose.

The Martin Group had named the project Urban Haven, encompassing office buildings, villas, and residential zones.

Every day, Evelyn and her assistant, Gabrielle, visited the construction site while delegating other company matters to Gregory and his team. The project required constant interaction with various stakeholders. Evelyn’s sincerity and humility won her favor—she listened to everyone’s input and considered it seriously. The feedback from the site was overwhelmingly positive.

By late afternoon, as they prepared to leave, Daniel approached her. "Evelyn, there’s a dinner tonight with the interior design team. Care to join us?"

After recent collaborations, Daniel had grown comfortable addressing her by her first name.

Evelyn wasn’t fond of networking events, but refusing might create friction. She agreed.

"Alright. I’ll follow your car."

"Perfect."

The dinner was held at one of the Martin Group’s preferred upscale hotels.

The introductions were smooth, the atmosphere warm.

When the group suggested moving to a club afterward, Evelyn declined. "You all go ahead. I’ll catch up next time."

Daniel backed her up, allowing her to leave without protest.

As she and Gabrielle exited, they were intercepted by a group of notorious socialites—some of whom Evelyn recognized from elite circles.

Normally, she would’ve ignored them, but tonight, they blocked her path.

Dominic, the one who knew her name, smirked. "Well, if it isn’t Ms. Mitchell? Still as stunning as ever."

Evelyn gave a curt nod.

The man beside Dominic sneered. "What, too good to talk to us now?"

Dominic chuckled. "Oh, you know how it is—the colder they seem, the hotter they burn behind closed doors."

Laughter erupted.

Gabrielle shrank back, clutching Evelyn’s sleeve nervously.

Evelyn remained composed, meeting Dominic’s gaze. "Mr. Lynch, if you’re done, I’ll be on my way."

Dominic leered, stepping aside but slipping a business card into her pocket as she passed. "Heard you know how to have fun. Call me if you want a good time."

Evelyn didn’t react, walking away without a word. Behind her, whispers followed.

"Think she’ll actually call?"

"Of course. Women like her always do."

Their voices faded as they reached the parking lot. Only then did Gabrielle speak. "Ms. Mitchell, are you okay? They were disgusting."

"I’m fine," Evelyn replied calmly, retrieving the card and tossing it out the window.

She dismissed the encounter. The Urban Haven project was progressing smoothly—finally, a moment to breathe.

After the incident at Martin Manor, the divorce discussion with Nathaniel had stalled.

He had refused to engage, leaving for a two-day business trip before finally returning tonight.

Dinner was silent.

Isabella had been busy lately and wasn’t present.

Evelyn broke the quiet first. "Nathaniel, where did you go these past two days?"

"Think I lied about the trip?"

"That’s not what I meant."

She had only asked casually—how had he twisted it?

Nathaniel studied her before asking, "Why so quiet now?"

"I didn’t assume anything."

"Hm."

Silence again.

It wasn’t until after dinner that they spoke once more.

Nathaniel retreated to his study; Evelyn returned to their bedroom.

After showering, she paused before the full-length mirror while selecting tomorrow’s outfit.

She studied her reflection. Though the baby wasn’t even three months along, she could already see the subtle changes.

Her stomach had grown.

She turned, examining her profile before lifting her shirt and resting her hands on her belly. A small smile touched her lips.

"Hello, little one. I’m your mom."

"What are you doing?" Nathaniel’s voice cut through the room.

Evelyn startled, quickly lowering her shirt.

Their eyes met. She forced calm into her expression. "Just checking the mirror."

"Just checking?"

He approached slowly, stopping inches away.

Evelyn lowered her gaze. "Finished with work?"

"Evelyn. Are you deflecting?"

"No."

"Then answer the question."

His persistence was relentless.

Evelyn exhaled softly. "Nathaniel, I was just looking. I’ve gained some weight recently."

"Have you?" His brow arched. "Where?"

She pressed her lips together. "My waist. My stomach."

"Is that so?"

"Yes."

"Let me see." Before she could react, his hand settled over her abdomen through the fabric.

Evelyn froze.

Nathaniel didn’t notice her tension, mistaking it for shyness. His fingers traced the curve of her belly. "Hm. A little softer, maybe."

Then his hand slid to her waist. "But your waist is still slim. Did you overeat tonight?"

Evelyn’s jaw tightened imperceptibly.

Nathaniel caught her gaze in the mirror. "Why so quiet?"
###Chapter 67

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She traced the contours of his face lightly with her fingertips, careful not to wake him. Last night had been intense—another argument about Isabella.

Evelyn slipped out of bed, wrapping herself in a silk robe. The penthouse was eerily quiet, save for the distant hum of the city below. She padded to the floor-to-ceiling windows, gazing at the skyline. The view was breathtaking, but her mind was elsewhere.

Isabella had been calling Nathaniel again.

Evelyn clenched her fists. She knew she shouldn’t let it get to her, but the woman was relentless. Just when things seemed to settle, Isabella would reappear like a ghost from Nathaniel’s past.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory.

"Meeting at 10. The client wants revisions."

Evelyn sighed. Work was the last thing on her mind, but she couldn’t afford to slack off. Not with the Summit Realty project hanging in the balance.

She turned back to Nathaniel, still asleep. His dark lashes fanned against his cheeks, his expression peaceful. For a moment, she allowed herself to forget the tension between them.

Then her phone buzzed again.

This time, it was an unknown number.

Her stomach twisted as she read the message:

"You think you’ve won him, Evelyn? He’ll always be mine."

No signature. None was needed.

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Isabella was playing games again.

She glanced at Nathaniel, torn between waking him and handling this alone.

But before she could decide, the bedroom door creaked open.

Alfred stood there, his expression grave.

"Madam," he said quietly. "Your presence is required downstairs. Immediately."

Evelyn frowned. "What’s wrong?"

Alfred hesitated. "It’s Mr. Martin. He’s here."

Her blood ran cold.

Edward Martin never visited unannounced.

Something was very, very wrong.

Evelyn attempted to put some distance between them, her voice strained. "Nathaniel, let me go."

"What if I refuse?"

Instead of releasing her, he leaned in closer, his arms encircling her waist from behind. His chin rested on her shoulder, their reflection in the mirror an intimate tangle of limbs and unspoken tension.

She squirmed, but Nathaniel only tightened his hold. "Are you blushing, Evelyn?"

"I'm not—just give me some space. I can't think like this."

"Am I making you uncomfortable?"

His warm breath ghosted over the shell of her ear, sending an involuntary shiver down her spine.

What was wrong with him?

Since when had he become so... possessive?

When she didn’t answer, Nathaniel continued, his voice laced with quiet accusation. "You’ve been avoiding me, Evelyn. Not a single call. Are you trying to force my hand into this divorce? You’re ruthless."

His dark eyes met hers in the mirror, brimming with something unreadable—hurt, frustration, maybe even longing.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, her gaze flickering to the way his Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed. Then, abruptly, he turned her around, pressing his forehead against hers. His voice was rough. "Do you really want this?"

"You were the one who brought it up first."

How dare he act like the wounded party?

Wasn’t she the one who had been discarded?

"I mentioned it once," he countered, his grip on her waist tightening almost punishingly. "But you? You ran straight to Grandfather. What did you say to him, hm? What words did you use to twist his mind?"

His tone was deceptively soft, but the anger simmered beneath the surface.

Evelyn pushed against his chest, but he was immovable.

"Answer me," he demanded. "Are you in such a hurry to erase me from your life? Are you really that cruel?"

"Don’t rewrite history. You wanted this—to marry Isabella. How dare you turn this around on me?"

Their breaths mingled, heavy with unsaid words.

Nathaniel tilted her chin up, forcing her to meet his gaze. "I haven’t brought it up again. You need to convince Grandfather to drop it."

"No."

His brows furrowed. "Evelyn, be good."

Before she could protest, his lips crashed against hers, hard and demanding. She gasped, shoving at him with all her strength. When he finally pulled away, her voice was barely a whisper. "You can’t keep doing this to me."

It trembled, thick with unshed tears. Her eyes were red-rimmed, her nose stinging with the threat of a breakdown.

The sight made his pupils constrict, something sharp and painful lancing through his chest.

She looked up at him, raw and vulnerable. "Why are you hesitating now that Grandfather is on board? Nathaniel, what do you want?"

Before he could answer, he kissed her again—deep, consuming, leaving her breathless.

When they finally broke apart, his gaze was heavy, lingering on her flushed face.

He still didn’t let go.

Evelyn swallowed. "I’m on my period."

Nathaniel chuckled, low and dark. "I wasn’t asking for anything. What are you implying?"

His laughter echoed in the dressing room, neither light nor mocking—just unsettling.

Evelyn was lost.

Wasn’t he supposed to love Isabella? Then why was he saying these things? Doing these things?

But Nathaniel didn’t offer an explanation, and she wouldn’t ask.

Some answers were better left unknown.

His sudden shift left her reeling.

What game was he playing?

Before she could decipher his motives, trouble found her.

Caroline’s call came through, her voice tense. "Evelyn, someone’s spreading rumors about you. They’re saying you slept your way into the Martins’ good graces, that you—"

"What else?"

"It’s vile. Have you pissed someone off?"

Caroline hesitated before sending screenshots. The rumors hadn’t just surfaced—they’d been circulating for days, spreading like wildfire through their social circles.

Evelyn had only been back in Mayfield for a year, but the Mitchell name carried weight. The whispers were everywhere.

Before she could process it, Margaret called.

Ever since Evelyn had insisted on the divorce, her mother’s tone had been ice. "Is this why Nathaniel wants to divorce you? Because you’ve been whoring yourself out?"

Evelyn went rigid.

Margaret continued, indifferent to her silence. "I may not have raised you, but I taught you better than this. Is this how your grandmother raised you? To be this shameless?"

"Grandmother raised me well," Evelyn snapped. "You don’t get to insult her."

A beat of silence. Then, colder: "So it’s your own doing? You’re dragging the Mitchell name through the mud. How is Sophia supposed to find a good match now? You’re a disgrace."

"You believe every rumor without question? If that’s how little you think of me, then fine. Believe what you want."

Margaret’s voice turned shrill, demanding she fix this before it tarnished the family further.

Evelyn hung up, her mind racing.

This wasn’t random. Someone was orchestrating it.

But who?

At the office, she briefed Gregory.

His expression darkened. "I’ll find out who’s behind this. What about Nathaniel? How will you explain it to him?"

"If I’ve done nothing wrong, I don’t owe him an explanation."

Gregory studied her before nodding. He made a call, then sank into thought. Moments later, he dialed another number.

It was answered instantly.

His voice was steel. "I told you not to cross lines."

The voice on the other end was calm. "I hate her."

"So you ignore me now?"

Silence.

"Don’t do this again. Remember our goal."

"...Understood."

Gregory ended the call, pinching the bridge of his nose.

Who was pulling the strings?

And why?
###Chapter 68

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of our penthouse, painting the marble floors in warm hues. I stretched beneath the silk sheets, my fingers brushing against the empty space beside me. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

A sigh escaped my lips as I sat up, running a hand through my tangled hair. The bed felt too big without him. Too cold.

My phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gabrielle, my assistant:

"Evelyn, the client from Summit Realty wants to move the meeting to 2 PM. Also, Gregory called—he needs the revised blueprints by noon."

I groaned. Another day of juggling deadlines and demands.

Dragging myself out of bed, I padded to the bathroom, splashing cold water on my face. The reflection staring back at me looked tired. Dark circles shadowed my eyes, remnants of another sleepless night.

Nathaniel had been distant lately. Ever since Isabella resurfaced, his late nights at the office had become more frequent. Excuses piled up like unread emails.

I dressed quickly, opting for a tailored navy pantsuit—armor for the battles ahead.

The penthouse was eerily quiet as I made my way to the kitchen. Alfred, our butler, had already prepared breakfast: fresh fruit, avocado toast, and a steaming cup of Earl Grey.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted with a polite nod.

"Morning, Alfred," I murmured, picking at the toast. My appetite was nonexistent.

The elevator dinged, and my heart leapt—only to sink when Samuel, Nathaniel’s secretary, stepped out instead.

"Mrs. Martin," he said, adjusting his glasses. "Mr. Martin asked me to inform you he’ll be in meetings all day. He won’t be able to join you for dinner."

I forced a smile. "Of course. Thank you, Samuel."

As he left, my grip tightened around the teacup.

Isabella was back in town. And suddenly, my husband had no time for me.

The irony wasn’t lost on me.

My phone buzzed again—this time, a notification from a gossip column. A blurry photo of Nathaniel and Isabella at some high-end restaurant last night. The headline screamed: "Reunited? Martin Heir Spotted with Ex-Lover!"

The teacup slipped from my fingers, shattering on the marble floor.

Alfred rushed over. "Mrs. Martin, are you—"

"I'm fine," I lied, stepping around the broken porcelain.

But I wasn’t fine.

Because if Nathaniel was lying to me about where he’d been…

What else was he hiding?

Progress came swiftly from Gregory's side.

He handed the findings to Evelyn with a smirk. "Evelyn, what's your plan? I can help."

"I don't need your help. Focus on your own tasks. I'm heading to the site soon."

"What about this?" Gregory frowned, concern etching his features.

"No time to deal with it. Let it go for now."

Evelyn brushed it off, feigning ignorance as she left for the construction site. The day was packed—walking the grounds, revising blueprints, exhausting but invigorating. It kept her fit, and she told herself it was good for the baby.

At lunch, she dined with Daniel and the team. Familiar faces meant relaxed conversation.

Midway, she excused herself to the restroom.

On her way back, a figure blocked her path.

Dominic Lynch.

Hands in his pockets, he smirked. "Ms. Mitchell, what a coincidence. Care to join me for lunch?"

Evelyn remained composed. "Mr. Lynch, we're strangers. There's no need."

"Evelyn Mitchell," he leaned in, voice low, "don't push your luck. I have ways to make you regret it."

"Are you threatening me with illegal actions?"

Dominic fell silent, and Evelyn slipped past him.

The encounter left her uneasy.

Meanwhile, Samuel reported to Nathaniel.

"Sir, Dominic is dangerous. Given Mrs. Martin's beauty, wouldn't he—"

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened. "You think my wife is beautiful?"

Samuel hesitated. "I meant—would he harm her?"

"Keep an eye on her. Report anything unusual."

"Yes, sir."

Samuel retreated, relieved.

Alone, Nathaniel reclined in his chair, Samuel's words echoing. "Mrs. Martin's beauty."

He knew it well—the allure in her eyes, the way they unsettled him.

This woman affected him too much.

That evening, Evelyn left the site for Pineview Villa.

Her phone rang.

"Hello?"

"Evelyn? It's Isabella Davis."

"Isabella?"

First phone call.

Isabella cut to the chase. "Let's reconcile."

Evelyn laughed. "Are you serious?"

"I've reflected. Feelings can't be forced. If you and Nathaniel are truly in love, I'll step aside. Let's meet and talk."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "You want to meet?"

"Is that okay?"

Evelyn agreed—but not at a café. A hotel.

Isabella claimed she was filming nearby and didn’t want to cause a scene.

Evelyn played along.

In the hotel room, Isabella poured water. "Sorry for making you come all this way."

Evelyn didn’t sit. "What do you want?"

"If you don’t love Nathaniel, let him go."

"Ms. Davis, we’re married. He doesn’t want a divorce. Don’t you know that?"

"Lies!" Isabella snapped. "You’re clinging to him for money. Name your price."

Evelyn smirked. "So this ‘meal’ is a bribe?"

"Be smart, or you’ll regret it."

Isabella’s mask slipped.

"Ah. The real purpose surfaces."

Isabella didn’t deny it.

Evelyn waited, watching.

"What will it take for you to leave him?"

Evelyn had no obligation to answer.

As she left, Isabella sneered, "Let’s see who laughs last."

At the elevator, a hand yanked her into a dark room.

Light flicked on.

Dominic.

She jerked free. "What are you doing?"

"Waiting for you." He locked the door, advancing. "I’ve made my interest clear. Since you play hard to get, I’ll take what I want."

"Isabella put you up to this?"

His hesitation confirmed it.

He smirked, breath hot on her face. "Play with me tonight, or face the tabloids tomorrow. Your choice."

Evelyn tilted her head away. The light caught her flawless skin, her cold gaze oddly mesmerizing.

"Refusing means scandal?"

Dominic’s eyes darkened, his breathing ragged. "Don’t play innocent. You’ll enjoy this."

He lunged, pinning her to the couch, fumbling with his shirt.

Evelyn stayed calm. "Dominic, if it’s a game you want, I can make it... unforgettable."

###Chapter 69

The morning light filtered through the silk curtains, casting delicate patterns across our bedroom. I stirred awake to find Nathaniel's side of the bed already empty, the sheets cool to the touch. A faint trace of his cologne lingered in the air - sandalwood and something distinctly him.

"Alfred?" I called out, slipping into my robe.

The elderly butler appeared instantly, as if he'd been waiting just beyond the door. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin. Mr. Martin left early for an urgent board meeting. He asked me to inform you that he'll be home by dinner."

I nodded absently, my fingers tracing the edge of the marble vanity. The pregnancy test I'd taken yesterday still burned in my mind - those two pink lines that changed everything. I'd planned to tell him last night, but he'd come home so late, his tie loosened and eyes shadowed with exhaustion.

The phone vibrated on the nightstand. Isabella's name flashed across the screen, followed by a string of emojis - champagne glasses, a diamond ring. My stomach twisted. She'd been texting more frequently since the news broke about her engagement to that Italian count.

The kitchen smelled of freshly baked croissants and Rosalind's special blend of coffee. Gabrielle, my assistant, sat at the island, her tablet already open to my schedule. "Morning, Evelyn. The contractors for the waterfront project are waiting for your final approval on the blueprints. And Mr. Wilson called three times - something about the zoning permits?"

I sipped my orange juice, the acidity making me wince. "Tell Gregory I'll handle it. And push the contractor meeting to tomorrow. I need to..." My hand drifted unconsciously to my still-flat stomach.

Gabrielle's sharp eyes caught the gesture. A knowing smile played on her lips, but she tactfully said nothing.

The doorbell chimed. Alfred moved to answer it, but I waved him off. Through the frosted glass, I recognized Caroline's silhouette, her arms laden with shopping bags.

"Surprise!" she sang out, kissing my cheek. "I brought baby clothes. You know, just in case." She winked, then froze when she saw my face. "Oh my God. You're pregnant, aren't you?"

The words tumbled out before I could stop them. "Eight weeks. I haven't told Nathaniel yet."

Caroline squealed, dropping the bags to pull me into a hug. "This is perfect! Edward Martin will finally get his great-grandchild. The board will have to stop pressuring Nathaniel about the succession now."

I forced a smile, thinking of the tension that had been growing between Nathaniel and his grandfather. The old man's health was failing, and the family empire needed clear leadership. A baby would solve everything - at least on paper.

My phone buzzed again. This time it was Nathaniel. "Evelyn, we need to talk. I'll be home in an hour."

The seriousness in his voice sent a chill down my spine. Caroline squeezed my hand. "Whatever it is, you'll handle it. You always do."

But as I watched her leave, the unopened baby clothes still scattered across the foyer, I couldn't shake the feeling that this time might be different. That the carefully constructed world we'd built might be about to crumble.

And when the front door opened again an hour later, Nathaniel's stormy expression confirmed my fears. Behind him stood Isabella, her perfect lips curved in a smile that didn't reach her eyes.

"Darling," she purred, "we have so much to discuss."

Dominic's eyes gleamed with anticipation. "So you're finally dropping the ice queen act? Good. Since you're willing to play along, let's not waste time. But hurry—I took something, and I'm not patient."

Evelyn finally understood—he was under the influence.

"I'll cooperate, but don't hurt me."

Her voice was calm, laced with negotiation.

Dominic smirked and released her. As he turned to grab water, Evelyn lunged for the door—only for him to snatch her wrist just as her fingers brushed the knob.

"Lying bitch!"

He raised his hand to strike, but Evelyn caught his wrist mid-air. With a sharp twist, she bent his fingers back at a brutal angle.

Dominic howled in pain.

"You'll speak properly now," Evelyn warned, her voice icy. Then, stepping closer, she lowered her voice to a dangerous whisper. "Dominic, tell me—did Isabella send you after me?"

Sweating, Dominic nodded frantically. "Yes! It was her—Ms. Davis! Please, let go—"

Evelyn's expression darkened, her gaze glacial. Dominic shuddered—her beauty was lethal, her presence terrifying. Before he could react, a sharp pain exploded between his legs.

His vision whited out.

Then, before he could scream, Evelyn pulled a slender object from her pocket—a needle—and plunged it into his thigh. In seconds, Dominic crumpled to the floor.

Conscious but paralyzed, he stared up at her.

Evelyn smirked. "Now, let’s have some real fun."

Pineview Villa

Nathaniel had just returned when Isabella rushed to him, her face etched with false concern. "Nathaniel, something terrible happened."

His brow furrowed. "What?"

She bit her lip, hesitating. "It's about Evelyn. I heard it from Audrey—you know, my friend in the industry."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "What about Evelyn?"

"Don't be angry," Isabella murmured, eyes downcast. "But rumors are spreading. Evelyn’s been seen with Dominic Lynch—dinners, late nights. Tonight, they went to a hotel together..."

Nathaniel's expression turned to stone.

"You're lying."

"I'm just repeating what I heard," she said quickly. "Maybe you should ask her?"

Nathaniel didn’t call. Instead, he strode upstairs, lit a cigarette, and exhaled sharply. His phone was already in his hand.

No answer from Evelyn.

His next call was to Samuel. "Find Evelyn. Now."

Samuel’s voice was tense. "Right away, sir."

Within minutes, the report came. "Mrs. Martin entered a budget hotel at six. She hasn’t left."

Nathaniel’s grip on his phone turned deadly.

A car engine roared outside. Through the window, he watched Evelyn step out, composed as ever.

Alfred greeted her in the foyer. "Dinner’s ready. Mr. Martin is upstairs."

"I’ll get him," Evelyn said.

But Isabella intercepted her, voice dripping with faux sweetness. "Evelyn, where have you been?"

Evelyn studied Isabella’s face—pretty, poised, poisonous.

She ignored her.

Isabella pressed on. "Nathaniel knows what you’ve been doing. How shameful."

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed. "And what exactly have I done, Isabella? Enlighten me."

Isabella’s gaze flicked to the stairs—Nathaniel was descending, his expression unreadable.

"Don’t be mad," she simpered. "Evelyn probably just met a friend."

Nathaniel didn’t look at Evelyn. "Dinner."

Isabella shot Evelyn a triumphant glare before following him.

The meal was silent. Nathaniel’s cold detachment was a wall. Isabella, restless, suddenly gasped at her phone.

"Evelyn! How could you?"

Evelyn didn’t flinch.

Isabella shoved the phone at Nathaniel. On the screen:

[Evelyn slept with Dominic. Disgusting. He’s bragging about it everywhere.]

Nathaniel slid the phone toward Evelyn. "Explain."

Evelyn met his gaze. "Do you believe me?"

The air thickened.

Before Nathaniel could speak, Isabella cut in. "Admit it, Evelyn! You and Dominic—"

Evelyn’s smile was razor-thin. "You seem very informed, Isabella. What’s your game?"

Isabella recoiled. "How dare you accuse me!"

Evelyn dialed a number. A hoarse voice answered. "Dominic here."

Isabella paled.

Evelyn’s gaze never left her. "Dominic, who told you to target me?"

"It was Isabella! She said you’d be easy—"

"Lies!" Isabella shrieked. "Nathaniel, he’s lying! Someone put him up to this!"

Nathaniel remained silent, his eyes dark storms.

Evelyn hung up. "The truth is right here, Nathaniel. Do you still think she’s innocent?"

###Chapter 70

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She traced the curve of his jaw with her fingertips, marveling at how peaceful he looked.

A soft knock interrupted the quiet.

"Mrs. Martin?" Alfred’s voice was muffled through the door. "Mr. Edward has requested your presence in the study."

Evelyn frowned. Edward rarely summoned her directly. Something must be urgent.

"I’ll be right there," she whispered, careful not to wake Nathaniel.

Slipping into a silk robe, she padded down the grand staircase, her mind racing. The study door was slightly ajar, and she could hear Edward’s low, measured tones.

"Come in, Evelyn," he called before she could knock.

Inside, Edward sat behind his mahogany desk, his expression unreadable. Winston stood beside him, his usual composed demeanor tinged with tension.

"You wanted to see me?" Evelyn asked, folding her arms against the morning chill.

Edward steepled his fingers. "There’s been a development regarding the Summit Realty deal."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. "What kind of development?"

"Sebastian Wilson has made a counteroffer," Edward said, sliding a document toward her. "One that complicates things."

She scanned the pages, her stomach tightening. The terms were aggressive—too aggressive. "This isn’t just business," she murmured. "He’s targeting Nathaniel."

Edward’s gaze darkened. "Precisely."

A sharp knock made them all turn. Nathaniel stood in the doorway, his hair still tousled from sleep, but his eyes alert. "What’s going on?"

Evelyn hesitated, but Edward spoke first. "We have a problem."

Nathaniel stepped inside, closing the door behind him. "Then let’s solve it."

The air in the room grew heavier as the four of them exchanged glances. Whatever was coming, Evelyn knew one thing—this wasn’t just about business anymore.

Nathaniel's expression darkened as his piercing gaze swept over Isabella with indifference before he rose from his seat. "Isabella, Samuel has secured an apartment for you. You'll move in tomorrow. Have the staff assist with packing your belongings this evening."

Without another word, he strode out of the dining room.

Isabella's voice trembled with indignation. "Nathaniel, are you really casting me aside? Throwing me out like this?"

Only silence answered her.

Evelyn watched his retreating figure, a bitter ache settling in her chest. Despite everything, he still couldn’t bring himself to be truly harsh with Isabella.

A self-mocking smile tugged at her lips, her eyes turning colder.

Yet Isabella directed all her fury at Evelyn, her glare venomous. "This was your doing, Evelyn. You set me up."

"Keep looking at me like that," Evelyn warned icily, her flawless features radiating frost, "and I might just expose everything to your adoring fans. Let them see the real you."

Isabella clenched her fists, falling silent—but the hatred in her eyes deepened.

Evelyn plucked a wet wipe from the table, cleaned her hands, and left without another glance.

Initially, she had considered making Isabella’s deception public, shattering her carefully crafted innocent image. But upon reflection, she realized the truth might not sway the masses—it might only make her more visible. She didn’t crave that spotlight.

Besides, she wasn’t naive enough to think Nathaniel would sever ties with Isabella over this. Love wasn’t so easily discarded.

All she wanted was for Isabella to leave Pineview Villa. She refused to share a roof with her any longer.

Now that it was done, she had no intention of pushing further.

As for Dominic Lynch—he had been cautious ever since Isabella lured her to that hotel. The call she made afterward had been to Caroline, who held damning evidence of Dominic’s drug use. Enough to implicate the Lynch family. He wouldn’t dare cross her.

With this chapter closed, Evelyn didn’t feel relief—only exhaustion.

Back in their bedroom, Nathaniel stood by the window, his silhouette rigid. She closed the door softly and approached.

"Are you upset because of Isabella?" she asked quietly.

Wasn’t he supposed to be pleased that Isabella’s true nature had been revealed?

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. After a weighted silence, he turned, his voice low and rough. "You knew from the start she was involved?"

Evelyn met his stormy gaze unflinchingly, a faint smile on her lips. "Yes. She thought meeting me would provoke me into saying something to you—something that would force you to publicly clarify our relationship."

His frown deepened. "Why didn’t you tell me?"

"What would that have accomplished?"

"Evelyn, we’re married. Keeping this from me—was that your idea of handling it?"

His anger was palpable.

She exhaled softly. "I didn’t mean it like that. I just thought it was better if I dealt with it myself. That way, you wouldn’t have to choose between standing by her or fulfilling your duty as my husband. You wouldn’t have to explain yourself to her."

"So this was for my sake?" His voice dripped with icy sarcasm.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, saying nothing.

Was he blaming her? For humiliating Isabella?

Nathaniel’s gaze bore into her, unrelenting. "You knew the risks, yet you walked right into danger—just to expose her. Did you think you were being clever? Do you have any idea what kind of man Dominic Lynch is? Aren’t you afraid of dying?"

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Was his anger actually concern—for her?

She bit her lip, suddenly at a loss.

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened further, his handsome face carved from ice. "You think risking your life was worth it? Just to punish Isabella? Evelyn, how much of you don’t I know?"

Though his mouth curved into a cold smile, his eyes burned with fury. With one last scathing look, he turned and stalked into the bathroom.

Evelyn stood frozen, the weight of his words pressing down on her. For a fleeting moment, she had thought his anger stemmed from worry.

But now she understood—he was only upset because Isabella had been hurt.

Her smile turned brittle. Of course.

The next morning, Isabella moved out of Pineview Villa.

Nathaniel had arranged an apartment—close enough for convenience, yet far enough to create distance. Her agent, Vanessa, had inspected it beforehand, ensuring everything was ready for her arrival.

He didn’t make me leave because of Evelyn, Isabella told herself. He found the perfect place for me. He’s protecting me—keeping me safe.

She channeled all her resentment toward Evelyn but refused to let her witness her departure. She waited until Evelyn had left before gathering her things.

Vanessa arrived to pick her up. The ride was silent until Vanessa spoke. "Mr. Martin did this for your own good. If he hadn’t acted, Evelyn wouldn’t have let it go. You’re still the most important person to him."

Isabella lowered her sunglasses, studying her agent. "You really think so?"

"Of course."

Some of the tension left Isabella’s shoulders. She hummed softly, then murmured, "I may be leaving, but Evelyn won’t get off so easily."

With Isabella gone, Pineview Villa settled back into its usual rhythm.

The staff exchanged relieved whispers. "Thank goodness Ms. Davis is gone. She was impossible—sweet as honey when Mr. Martin was around, but a tyrant when he wasn’t."

"Mrs. Martin is much better. She doesn’t fuss over us, but she’s fair. Easy to work for."

Neither Evelyn nor Nathaniel heard them. The chill between them had returned, thicker than ever.

At the office, Evelyn finalized the interior design drafts. She didn’t need to visit the site today, but she did have to go to Martin Group—to deliver the plans to Daniel Carter’s team for review.

Gregory accompanied her.

On the way, he suddenly asked, "So, is the Isabella situation finally resolved?"
###Chapter 71

The morning sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of our penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. I stretched beneath the silk sheets, my fingers brushing against the empty space where Nathaniel should have been. The digital clock on the nightstand blinked 7:32 AM - unusually early for him to be gone.

"Alfred?" I called out, slipping into my robe.

The elderly butler appeared almost instantly at the bedroom door. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin. Mr. Martin left for an emergency board meeting at six. He asked me to inform you he'll be back by lunchtime."

I frowned, running a hand through my tangled hair. "Did he say what it was about?"

"No, madam. Only that it concerned the Singapore acquisition." Alfred hesitated. "Though Mr. Yates did look rather... distressed when he came to fetch him."

The knot in my stomach tightened. Samuel never looked distressed. Something was wrong.

My phone buzzed violently on the vanity. Caroline's name flashed across the screen. "Evelyn! Turn on Channel 7 right now!"

I grabbed the remote with trembling hands. The screen flickered to life, showing a glamorous red carpet event from last night. And there, in crisp high-definition, was Nathaniel with his arm wrapped possessively around Isabella's waist, her scarlet dress clinging to every curve as she leaned into him with practiced ease.

The caption read: "Martin Heir Rekindles Romance with Supermodel Ex at Charity Gala."

The remote slipped from my fingers, hitting the plush carpet with a muted thud. The reporter's voice continued cheerfully, "Sources say the former couple spent over two hours in private conversation at the afterparty before leaving together—"

The screen went black as I stabbed the power button. My reflection in the dark television showed wide, wounded eyes and lips pressed into a bloodless line.

"Alfred," I said, my voice eerily calm. "Get the car ready. I'm going to the office."

"But Mr. Martin specifically said—"

"I don't care what he said." I yanked open my closet doors with more force than necessary. "If Nathaniel wants to play games, he can explain himself to my face."

As I dressed in a sharply tailored navy suit - armor for the coming battle - my phone buzzed again. An unknown number. The text contained only an address and a time: 11 AM. Below it, a single photograph that stopped my heart - Nathaniel and Isabella in what appeared to be a hotel elevator, his mouth buried in her neck, her fingers tangled in his hair.

The timestamp read 2:47 AM.

My wedding ring felt suddenly heavy, the diamonds cutting into my clenched fist. The man who'd sworn to love me forever had been with her. Again. After everything.

The intercom buzzed. "Madam, the car is ready."

I squared my shoulders, slipping the phone into my pocket. Whatever game Nathaniel was playing, he was about to learn I wasn't some naive girl he could manipulate anymore. Not after last time.

Not ever again.

"It's done. She's moved out of Pineview Villa and into Maple Apartment."

Nathaniel glanced at Evelyn as they waited at the traffic light. His voice was low. "Was that your idea?"

Evelyn exhaled softly. "His. But he seems... annoyed with me."

"Because you handled Isabella the way you did?"

Gregory cut straight to the point. Evelyn instinctively met his gaze, her tone steady. "Something like that. Do you agree with him?"

"Honestly? I just wish you'd let me handle it. If you'd gotten hurt, I'd never forgive myself for failing to protect you. Promise me you won't do this again."

His words were gentle, and Evelyn could only nod in agreement.

As for why she hadn’t told Gregory—she didn’t have an answer. At the time, it hadn’t even crossed her mind to involve him. She’d wanted to deal with it herself.

Maybe she just hadn’t wanted to burden him.

Soon, they arrived at Martin Group.

Daniel and his team led them straight to the conference room. The architectural drafts were intricate, with stark differences between office buildings, villas, and residential complexes. The discussion stretched on for hours.

Meanwhile, in Nathaniel’s office, Samuel reported promptly, "Mr. Martin, your wife and Gregory are downstairs reviewing the drafts with Daniel. Would you like to join them?"

"Do I look like I have nothing better to do, Samuel? Or do you?"

Nathaniel’s expression was unreadable, his gaze icy. The sharpness in his tone made Samuel lower his head immediately.

"My apologies, Mr. Martin. I’ll go prepare the materials for your afternoon meeting."

With that, Samuel hurried out.

Had he misread the situation?

Just last night, Nathaniel had called him at midnight, demanding he secure a fully furnished apartment for Isabella immediately. Samuel had assumed that meant Nathaniel was growing closer to Evelyn.

In his office, Nathaniel stared at the document in his hands, but the words blurred together.

His jaw tightened.

Then, his phone rang.

"Speak."

"Grandfather’s birthday is coming up. What’s the plan?" Richard’s voice came through.

Edward’s birthday was less than a week away, and Nathaniel had already made arrangements. He relayed them to Richard. "We’ll host it at Martin Manor. It’s been a while since the family gathered there. And after Grandfather’s recent hospitalization, this will reassure everyone."

"Sounds good. Also, bring Evelyn over for dinner soon. Last time ended awkwardly. Grandfather wants to check in with you both."

"We’ll see. Both of us are swamped these days."

"Fine. But one thing—whatever you decide, it needs Grandfather’s approval. Or I won’t let it slide."

Even though Richard had stepped back from Martin Group, he was still Nathaniel’s father.

After hanging up, Nathaniel set his phone down and rubbed his temples.

Evelyn had disrupted his focus more than once. The more he thought about it, the more irritated he grew. What kind of spell has this woman cast?

Time passed quickly, and before he knew it, it was lunchtime.

Evelyn was wrapping up in the conference room when Daniel suggested, "Want to grab lunch together?"

"Thanks, but we’ve got a lot to finalize this afternoon. Maybe another time?"

"Sure. I won’t keep you."

Daniel shook Gregory’s hand and watched them leave.

As they waited for the elevator, Gregory asked, "Do you think Daniel was hinting we should work directly with Martin Group instead of Summit Realty?"

"Seemed like it," Evelyn admitted, frustration creeping in. Summit Realty had been unreliable, but breaking their contract now felt unethical.

Gregory pressed, "Daniel works for Martin Group. Do you think this is what Nathaniel wants too?"

"I don’t know, and I’d rather not think about it. Things are fine as they are."

She wanted to avoid deeper entanglement with Martin Group—and Nathaniel—before the divorce.

But she kept that to herself.

Evelyn fell silent.

Gregory studied her expression. "Evelyn, honestly? Working directly with Martin Group could be a game-changer for us. It’d take our firm to the next level."

Evelyn looked at him in surprise, but before she could respond, the elevator doors opened.

Samuel stepped out. Evelyn nodded briefly, but he stopped in front of her.

"Mrs. Martin," he said quietly, "Mr. Martin knows you’re here. He’d like you to join him upstairs."

"Is something wrong?"

"It’s about Sir Edward’s birthday. Perhaps you could discuss it with him?"

"Of course." Evelyn turned to Gregory. "Go ahead without me. I’ll talk to Nathaniel about the party."

Gregory nodded. "Need me to wait?"

"No, it’s late. Grab lunch. I’ll take a cab back."

"Alright. See you." He stepped into the elevator.

Samuel and Evelyn took Nathaniel’s private elevator to the top floor. The executive floor was quiet, with only Nathaniel’s secretarial staff working. They didn’t know Evelyn’s identity, but they kept their curiosity to themselves.

When they reached his office, Nathaniel was on the phone. Evelyn sat on the sofa to wait.

Two lunch boxes sat on the coffee table.

One was clearly for her.

Watching him, her heart fluttered.

A minute later, Nathaniel hung up and joined her, sitting in the armchair beside her. "Eat," he said simply.

Neither mentioned last night as they ate in silence.

Evelyn’s pregnancy had dulled her appetite. She set her lunch box aside after a few bites.

Nathaniel noticed. "Not hungry?"

"I had snacks earlier with Daniel. I’m fine."

He hummed in response.

She broke the silence. "Nathaniel, about Grandfather’s birthday—what do you need me to do?"
###Chapter 72

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers hovered over the blueprints, but her mind was elsewhere—Nathaniel had been acting strangely since their return from the Hamptons.

Gabrielle knocked lightly before entering, balancing two steaming cups of coffee. "You look like you could use this," she said, setting one down beside Evelyn's elbow.

"Thanks," Evelyn murmured, wrapping her hands around the warm ceramic. The rich aroma did little to calm her nerves.

"Mr. Wilson called while you were in your meeting," Gabrielle added, flipping through her tablet. "He said the client approved the final revisions for the Montclair project."

Evelyn nodded absently. "Good. That's one less thing to worry about."

Gabrielle hesitated. "Is everything okay? You've been... distracted all morning."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Just tired. Late night."

The truth was, she'd spent hours replaying Nathaniel's cryptic behavior—the way he'd abruptly ended their call last night, the tension in his voice when he mentioned an "unexpected meeting" today. She knew better than to pry; his family's business dealings were a labyrinth of secrets. But the gnawing suspicion that Isabella was involved again refused to quiet.

Her phone buzzed—a text from Charlotte: Lunch at Bistro 45? I have news.

Evelyn typed a quick reply. Be there in 20.

The bistro's terrace was half-empty, the midday crowd thinning. Charlotte waved from a corner table, her auburn curls catching the sunlight.

"You look like hell," she announced as Evelyn slid into the wrought-iron chair.

"Charming as ever," Evelyn deadpanned, signaling the waiter for a sparkling water.

Charlotte leaned forward, lowering her voice. "Okay, spill. What's got you wound tighter than a Rolex?"

Evelyn traced the condensation on her glass. "It's Nathaniel. He's been... evasive. And I think Isabella's back in the picture."

Charlotte's eyes widened. "Again? That woman's like a bad penny."

Before Evelyn could respond, her phone lit up with a notification—a gossip column headline: Martin Heir Spotted at Luxe Hotel with Former Flame. The accompanying photo, though grainy, was unmistakable: Nathaniel holding a door open for Isabella, her trademark smirk in place.

Evelyn's stomach dropped.

Charlotte snatched the phone, scowling. "This was today? What the actual—"

"Don't." Evelyn's voice was eerily calm. "There's got to be an explanation."

But even as she said it, the doubts slithered in. Nathaniel had promised transparency after the last Isabella debacle. Yet here they were, replaying the same nightmare.

Charlotte gripped her hand. "Confront him. Tonight."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "I will. But first..." She pulled up Nathaniel's contact, fingers trembling slightly. We need to talk. Pineview, 8 PM.

The reply came instantly: I'll be there.

No excuses. No delays.

That, at least, was something.

The afternoon passed in a blur of meetings and unanswered questions. By seven, Evelyn stood at the villa's grand piano, idly pressing keys. The discordant notes mirrored her thoughts.

Alfred appeared in the doorway. "Madam, Mr. Martin has arrived."

She turned as Nathaniel strode in, his tailored coat dusted with rain. His expression was unreadable.

"You saw the photos," he stated.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Enlighten me, Nathaniel. What possible reason could you have for meeting her alone?"

He ran a hand through his hair. "It wasn't planned. She showed up at the office, claiming it was about Edward's anniversary gala."

"And you believed her?"

"No." His jaw tightened. "But she threatened to go to the press with 'our story' if I refused. I needed to control the narrative."

Evelyn scoffed. "By giving her exactly what she wanted? Access to you?"

Nathaniel stepped closer, his voice dropping. "I recorded the entire conversation. She admitted the blackmail scheme. It's over, Evelyn."

The raw conviction in his eyes gave her pause. But before she could respond, the doorbell chimed.

Alfred reappeared, visibly uneasy. "Madam... Ms. Davis is at the gate. She insists on speaking with you both."

Nathaniel's face darkened. "Send her away."

Evelyn held up a hand. "No. Let her in."

As Alfred retreated, Nathaniel gripped her shoulder. "Why?"

"Because," Evelyn said coolly, "I want to see her face when I destroy whatever game she's playing."

The front door opened. Isabella's laughter floated down the hall, sharp as broken glass.

"Darling," she purred, rounding the corner in a cloud of Chanel No. 5, "did you miss me?"

Evelyn smiled. It didn't reach her eyes.

"Actually," she said, "we were just discussing how you're about to learn what happens when you threaten the wrong family."

Isabella's smirk faltered.

Nathaniel's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, then at Evelyn. "It's Samuel. The board just received an anonymous tip about Isabella's embezzlement at Davis Holdings."

Evelyn tilted her head. "How... unfortunate for you, Isabella."

The color drained from Isabella's face.

Outside, thunder rumbled. The storm, it seemed, had arrived right on schedule.

Nathaniel set down his fork, dabbing his lips with a linen napkin before meeting Evelyn's gaze. "Grandfather's birthday celebration needs to be memorable. Also, tonight, we'll formally invite the Mitchells together—as husband and wife."

It wasn't a request. It was a declaration.

Edward's birthday would inevitably include the Mitchells, and going with Nathaniel was far better than facing them alone. At least this way, she could avoid unnecessary drama.

Evelyn nodded. "Fine. We'll do it your way."

"I'll pick you up at seven."

"No need. I can drive myself. We'll meet at Mitchell Manor—"

"Evelyn." His voice was firm, leaving no room for argument. "We're married. Couples arrive together."

There was something different about his tone today—more resolute, more possessive. She pressed her lips together and acquiesced silently.

Nathaniel had a meeting, so Evelyn didn’t linger. She hailed a cab back to the office, intending to discuss design revisions with Gregory, only to be told by his assistant, "Mr. Wilson hasn’t returned yet."

"Still?"

Frowning, she pulled out her phone and dialed Gregory. The call rang through, but no one answered. She dismissed it, assuming he was tied up, and retreated to her own office.

Work consumed her until her phone buzzed with an incoming call. The name flashing on the screen made her lips curl into an involuntary smile.

She answered immediately. "Well, look who finally remembered me."

"Don’t flatter yourself," came the dry response. "I just didn’t want you to think I was desperate."

Evelyn chuckled. "Oh, so now I’m the desperate one?"

"Are you saying I am?"

"Wouldn’t dream of it." She leaned back in her chair, grinning. "So, what’s the occasion?"

"I’ll be in Mayby next month for work. Drinks?"

"Absolutely. Tell me when, and I’ll book us a place."

"Can I crash at yours?"

"If you want."

"Good. Because I do. See you then."

They exchanged a few more playful jabs before hanging up. Evelyn was still smiling when Nathaniel’s text came through:

Downstairs. Now.

She typed a quick On my way, shut down her computer, and grabbed her bag. As she passed Gregory’s office, she paused. "Still no sign of him?"

His assistant shook his head. "No, and he’s not answering his phone."

Evelyn checked her watch. "Keep trying. Tell him to text me the second you reach him."

Outside, Nathaniel’s car idled by the curb. She slid into the passenger seat, buckling up before glancing at him. "How long have you been waiting?"

"Not long. Who were you laughing with earlier?"

"A friend."

She offered no further explanation, and he didn’t press.

The drive to Mitchell Manor was silent. William and Margaret weren’t expecting them, so when Evelyn and Nathaniel stepped inside, Margaret’s shrill voice carried through the foyer.

"—ungrateful, that’s what she is! After everything we’ve done, she dares to humiliate us like this? If we hadn’t taken her in, if we hadn’t married her off to the Martins, she’d be nothing! And now she drags our name through the mud with her scandals!"

Margaret’s tirade was venomous, every word dripping with resentment.

"Mother, please," Sophia interjected softly. "You know what the doctor said about your blood pressure. Evelyn and Nathaniel’s marriage is their business. We shouldn’t interfere."

"Their business? She’s still a Mitchell! I don’t expect her to bring glory to this family, but I do expect her not to ruin us! Those rumors—disgusting!"

"It might just be a misunderstanding. Dominic has always been reckless. Evelyn wouldn’t—"

"Sophia, stop defending her! She didn’t grow up here. We don’t know what she’s capable of!"

Evelyn stood frozen in the doorway, her fingers digging into the edge of the console table. Nathaniel’s hand closed over hers, warm and steady, as he guided her forward.

His voice cut through the room like steel. "Had we not come today, we wouldn’t have known how deeply you resent us."

Margaret paled. Sophia stiffened.

"Nathaniel!" Margaret scrambled to her feet, forcing a smile. "Please, sit! We had no idea you were coming."

Her glare at Evelyn was accusatory—why didn’t you warn us?

Sophia hurried to order coffee. "You should’ve told us. We’d have prepared dinner."

"I came with Evelyn." Nathaniel didn’t release her hand as they sat.

Evelyn remained silent, her expression unreadable.

William entered then, his demeanor polite but wary. Even as Nathaniel’s father-in-law, he knew his place in the business hierarchy.

Small talk lasted all of five minutes before Evelyn spoke. "We’re here to invite you to Grandfather Martin’s birthday celebration."

Margaret’s face darkened. "Evelyn, after everything Nathaniel has forgiven you for, how can you still—"

"Mother." Sophia tugged at her sleeve. "Nathaniel is right here."

Evelyn’s voice was icy. "So, as the daughter you didn’t raise, as the stranger you don’t understand, everything I do is wrong. Is that it?"

Margaret opened her mouth, but Evelyn continued.

"Nathaniel and I are inviting you to Grandfather’s birthday party at Martin Manor. That’s all."

The room fell silent.

William cleared his throat. "Of course. Please extend our best wishes to Edward."

Nathaniel stood, pulling Evelyn up with him. Despite William’s insistence they stay for dinner, Nathaniel declined. "We have reservations."

As they left, Margaret’s stunned expression was almost comical.

Sophia murmured, "Nathaniel seems… protective of her. You should be more careful, Mother."

She hurried upstairs, her thoughts a tangled mess.

Outside, Evelyn buckled her seatbelt, but Nathaniel didn’t start the car.

She frowned. "Aren’t we leaving?"

"Where do you want to go?"

"…What?"
###Chapter 73

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of our penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. I stretched beneath the silk sheets, my fingers brushing against the empty space beside me. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

I sighed, rolling onto my back. The bed felt too large without him.

My phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gabrielle, my assistant: "Evelyn, the client meeting has been moved to 2 PM. Also, Gregory wants to discuss the new project before then."

I groaned. Another day of juggling deadlines and expectations.

As I stepped into the shower, the warm water did little to ease the tension in my shoulders. The last few weeks had been a blur of late nights and early mornings, with Nathaniel barely home long enough to share a meal. The Martin Group was swallowing him whole, and I was starting to feel like a stranger in my own marriage.

Dressed in a tailored navy suit, I grabbed my coffee and headed out. The city was alive with the hum of traffic and chatter, but I barely noticed. My mind was elsewhere—on the growing distance between us, on the unspoken words piling up like bricks in a wall neither of us knew how to dismantle.

The office was already buzzing when I arrived. Gregory leaned against my desk, arms crossed, a smirk playing on his lips. "You look like you could use another coffee."

"Or a vacation," I muttered, dropping my bag onto the chair.

He chuckled. "Well, until then, we’ve got the Kensington project to finalize. The investors are getting antsy."

I exhaled sharply. "Right. Let’s get to it."

By noon, my head was pounding. I rubbed my temples, willing the ache to fade. My phone lit up with a notification—a missed call from Nathaniel. No voicemail. No text. Just another unanswered attempt at connection.

I dialed his number, but it went straight to voicemail. "You’ve reached Nathaniel Martin. Leave a message."

I didn’t.

Instead, I stared at the screen, my thumb hovering over Isabella’s contact—the woman who had once been his everything. The woman who still lingered in the shadows of our marriage, a ghost I couldn’t exorcise.

A knock at my office door snapped me back to reality. Gabrielle poked her head in. "Evelyn, the client’s here early."

I plastered on a smile. "Send them in."

But as the meeting dragged on, my thoughts kept drifting back to Nathaniel. To the way his eyes had darkened last night when I’d asked about his day. To the way he’d turned away, shutting me out.

Something was wrong. And I wasn’t sure I could fix it this time.

The clock ticked past six. The office emptied. Still no word from him.

I packed up my things, my chest tight with unease.

Then my phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number:

"We need to talk. It’s about Nathaniel."

My breath caught.

The screen flashed again.

"Meet me at The Velvet Lounge. 8 PM. Alone."

I didn’t recognize the number. But something in my gut told me I couldn’t ignore it.

Because whatever was coming—it was going to change everything.

"Where should we dine?" Nathaniel asked, his piercing gaze fixed on Evelyn.

She blinked in surprise. "Aren't we heading back to Pineview?"

The mention of "heading back" seemed to please him. A faint smile curved his lips, softening his usually stern expression. "We're eating out tonight," he stated matter-of-factly.

Before Evelyn could process his words, Nathaniel accelerated the car.

Then, he asked again, "What are you craving?"

Evelyn didn’t refuse. After a brief pause, she suggested, "How about The Scarlet?"

The Scarlet specialized in light, fresh dishes—perfect for Nathaniel, who disliked heavy spices, and for Evelyn, who had been avoiding strong flavors lately. It was an ideal choice for both.

Despite being married for a year, this was their first time dining out alone.

Evelyn had often wanted to ask him for a private meal but hesitated, fearing rejection or coming across as clingy.

Dinner was quiet, just like their meals at home. Nathaniel had always preferred silence while eating.

Just as she wondered why he had taken her out tonight, his deep voice broke the stillness. "You're unusually quiet."

Evelyn looked up, meeting his intense gaze. "You usually prefer it this way," she replied softly. "No talking, no distractions."

"Who told you that?"

"It's how things are at home," she explained.

Nathaniel smirked, leaning slightly closer. "Evelyn, you pay a lot of attention to me, don’t you?"

Her eyes flickered away. "We’ve been married for a year, Nathaniel. Of course I’ve noticed a few things about you."

What she really wanted to ask was whether he had ever noticed anything about her.

But the answer might hurt too much, so she swallowed the question.

Nathaniel didn’t respond. Instead, he studied her. "You’ve been distracted lately. What’s going on?"

Evelyn stiffened, surprised he had noticed.

"Just work stress," she deflected.

He didn’t buy it. His frown deepened as he pressed, "Is your relationship with the Mitchells always this strained?"

She assumed he meant the emotional distance between her and her family.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, meeting his gaze head-on. "Strained?" She laughed lightly. "Maybe. The only one who truly mattered to me was my grandfather."

Though she hadn’t grown up with the Mitchells, her grandfather had always been kind, visiting her at her grandmother’s house with thoughtful gifts.

A soft smile touched her lips at the memory.

Nathaniel watched her, an unfamiliar emotion stirring within him.

They had shared a bed for a year, yet he realized now how little he truly knew her.

Who was Evelyn Mitchell?

After dinner, they returned to Pineview Villa. Nathaniel retreated to his study while Evelyn headed to their bedroom.

It was Edward’s birthday soon, and she wanted to find him the perfect gift. Knowing his love for oil paintings, she began searching for a meaningful piece.

Once she finalized the details, she checked her phone again. Still no reply from Gregory.

Since Nathaniel hadn’t returned, she tried calling Gregory once more.

The call was abruptly cut off, followed by a text: "Can’t talk now. Everything okay?"

Evelyn frowned. "You’ve been unreachable all day. What’s going on?"

"I’m fine. Don’t worry."

She wanted to press further, but the bedroom door opened—Nathaniel walked in. She quickly stopped texting.

Perhaps because of tonight’s dinner, the tension between them had eased slightly.

Over the next few days, they visited Martin Manor daily to help prepare for Edward’s birthday celebration. The old man was visibly delighted.

At one point, Edward murmured, "Things will be better soon."

His cryptic remark made everyone pause. Victoria asked, "Father, what do you mean?"

Evelyn froze.

Edward waved it off. "Just thinking aloud. I’ll feel better after my birthday."

"Father, are you unhappy now?"

"Of course not. My happiness lies in seeing all of you well."

His words carried an odd weight, making Richard and Victoria exchange glances with Evelyn and Nathaniel.

Then, Edward asked point-blank, "Nathaniel, Evelyn, have you decided whether you’re divorcing or not?"

Silence fell.

Edward continued, "If you stay married, I plan to formally introduce Evelyn as part of the Martin family at my birthday party."

Evelyn’s lips pressed into a thin line. "Grandfather, I’d rather keep it private."

If they divorced later, she didn’t want to be forever labeled as Nathaniel’s ex-wife.

She didn’t crave the spotlight—and she certainly wouldn’t use their marriage for personal gain.

But Nathaniel misinterpreted her refusal. His expression darkened. "Why? What’s wrong with going public?"

"Nathaniel, you want a divorce, don’t you? Announcing it now would only complicate things later. You don’t love me, so why bother?"

His jaw tightened. "Is this really about me, Evelyn? Or are you just keeping your options open?"

His usual charm vanished, replaced by cold anger.

Before she could respond, Nathaniel gave her one last piercing look and stormed upstairs.

The room fell silent.

Evelyn bit her lip, saying nothing. Victoria quickly intervened, "Evelyn, let’s go check on the cake, shall we?"

With a forced smile, Evelyn followed her.

Nathaniel’s coldness persisted until Edward’s birthday party.

The celebration was held in Martin Manor’s private banquet hall. The Martins were a prominent family in Mayby, and Edward, a revered business titan, had drawn an illustrious crowd.

The manor was alive with festivity, every detail reflecting the family’s refined taste. Edward’s favorite opera played onstage, performed by renowned maestros in his honor.

The celebration lasted all day—luncheon, afternoon tea, and finally, an evening dance for the younger guests. Before the dance, the family would present Edward with their gifts.

###Chapter 74

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of our penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. I stretched beneath the silk sheets, my fingers brushing against the cold, empty space beside me. Nathaniel had left early again—another board meeting at Martin Group headquarters.

My phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. Gabrielle's name flashed across the screen. "Evelyn, the client moved the presentation up to 10 AM. Gregory's already at the office reviewing the blueprints."

I groaned, throwing back the covers. Three hours of sleep wasn't nearly enough after last night's charity gala. The memory of Isabella's calculated smile across the ballroom still made my skin prickle. She'd clung to Nathaniel's arm like ivy on an oak tree, whispering God-knows-what in his ear while photographers snapped away.

The shower did little to wash away my unease. As steam fogged the mirrors, I traced the faint scar along my collarbone—a permanent reminder of the car accident that had nearly taken everything from me. From us.

"Alfred?" I called out, wrapping myself in a plush robe. The scent of freshly brewed coffee led me to the kitchen where our butler stood arranging breakfast. "Has Mr. Martin called?"

"Not yet, madam." His weathered hands paused over the silverware. "Though Mr. Yates did ring to say the Tokyo acquisition is proving... complicated."

I sipped the espresso, its bitterness mirroring my mood. Complicated. That word seemed to define our entire marriage these days. Between Nathaniel's mounting responsibilities and Isabella's sudden reappearance in New York, the foundation we'd painstakingly rebuilt felt shakier than ever.

My phone chimed again—a text from Charlotte: "Saw the society pages. That viper's fangs are showing again. Lunch at Le Bernardin? 1 PM. We're getting the corner booth and a bottle of Veuve."

I smiled despite myself. Some things never changed.

The elevator doors opened to reveal Gregory pacing our firm's reception area, his tie already loosened at 9:15 AM. "There you are," he exhaled, thrusting a tablet into my hands. "Summit Realty wants to scrap the entire west wing design. Sebastian Wilson himself called to—"

"Let me guess," I interrupted, scrolling through the revised plans. "More glass, less structural integrity?"

His grimace confirmed it. I squared my shoulders, the familiar thrill of an architectural challenge pushing aside personal worries. "Tell Jonathan Blake we'll meet them at the site at noon. And call Gabrielle—we'll need the revised load calculations before—"

The office phone rang shrilly. Gregory answered, then froze. His eyes locked onto mine with unsettling intensity. "It's Dr. Harrison. He says it's urgent."

The world tilted. Edward Martin had been hospitalized twice this year already. Nathaniel's grandfather was the only family member who'd welcomed me without reservation. My fingers trembled as I took the receiver.

"Evelyn," the physician's voice was taut. "It's not Edward this time. It's Nathaniel. There's been an incident at the construction site."

The receiver slipped from my grasp, clattering against the hardwood. Gregory's mouth moved, but all I heard was the blood roaring in my ears. The last coherent thought before the world went dark: Isabella had been at that site meeting too.

Richard and Victoria beamed as they stepped forward, the first to present their gift to Edward. It was an exquisitely carved wooden cane, polished to perfection.

"Happy birthday, Father. We hope it brings you comfort," Richard said warmly, while Victoria nodded in agreement.

Edward smiled approvingly. "Lovely."

Next came Nathaniel, who unveiled a custom-made chessboard crafted from rare emeralds, its intricate design drawing murmurs of admiration.

Then, it was Evelyn’s turn.

She handed Edward an oil painting, her voice soft but steady. "Grandfather, happy birthday."

Edward’s eyes lit up as he approached the painting, his affection for Evelyn evident. The guests exchanged knowing glances—everyone was aware of the bond between Edward and the Mitchells, so no one questioned her gesture.

Edward studied the artwork, his expression shifting to astonishment. "Evelyn… is this a Julian Mercer?"

Julian Mercer was a legendary artist, one of Edward’s lifelong favorites.

Evelyn nodded. "Do you like it?"

"Like it?" Edward chuckled, his voice thick with emotion. "I adore it. I’ve spent years trying to acquire one of his pieces at auction, but I never succeeded."

His excitement was palpable, and Richard and Victoria exchanged pleased smiles.

"I’m glad it brings you joy," Evelyn replied, her own happiness shining through.

"Would Sir Edward mind if we all admired it?" someone called out.

Evelyn glanced at Edward, who nodded. "It’s yours now, Grandfather. The decision is yours."

"Then let’s share it," Edward declared, carefully unveiling the canvas.

The painting depicted a breathtaking winter landscape—snow-capped mountains melting into crystalline rivers, the brushstrokes delicate yet bold, pulling the viewer into its serene world.

Gasps of admiration filled the room.

The moment was shattered by a sharp, skeptical voice.

"Are we sure this isn’t just a convincing replica? Evelyn only returned from the countryside last year. How could she possibly afford an original Mercer?"

The speaker was Audrey White, the heiress of the prominent White family, known for her sharp tongue and connections in high society.

A ripple of doubt spread through the crowd. Guests leaned in, scrutinizing the painting for flaws.

"It does look suspiciously perfect."

"An impressive imitation, but still a fake."

"Did Ms. Mitchell really deceive Sir Edward?"

The whispers grew louder.

Standing beside Audrey, Isabella tugged at her sleeve, feigning concern. "Audrey, don’t be harsh. Maybe Evelyn was tricked by a dealer. She wouldn’t knowingly give a fake."

Isabella hadn’t been invited—Audrey had brought her as a guest.

Audrey scoffed. "Isabella, you’re too forgiving. Deception is deception. My grandfather collects art—I know a counterfeit when I see one."

Most of the guests nodded, swayed by Audrey’s confidence.

All eyes turned to Evelyn, who remained composed, her expression unreadable.

She approached Edward and murmured, "Grandfather, you’ve been standing too long. Why don’t you sit and rest?"

Edward patted her hand. "Of course." He set the painting aside gently, his gaze lingering on it.

"Sir Edward, is the Mitchell family mocking you with a forgery?" someone dared to ask.

Edward’s smile vanished. Richard and Victoria stiffened, while Nathaniel’s gaze turned icy.

Before the Martins could respond, William spoke up. "Sir Edward, the Mitchells had no part in this. Evelyn… doesn’t consult us on anything. Rest assured, I’ll discipline her when we return."

He turned to Evelyn, his voice sharp. "Apologize. Now."

Evelyn didn’t move.

Margaret quickly added, "Please don’t judge the Mitchells by Evelyn’s actions. She’s only been back with us for a year. She keeps to herself—this was entirely her doing."

Margaret was desperate to distance the family, while William’s face burned with humiliation.

Before Evelyn could respond, Edward’s voice cut through the tension. "Enough. This is my birthday, not a courtroom. Even if it were a replica, I love it, and that’s what matters."

His words were firm, but Audrey wasn’t finished.

"Sir Edward, your kindness is admirable, but deception shouldn’t be excused. Evelyn owes everyone an explanation."

Isabella chimed in, her voice sweet. "Audrey, don’t be too harsh. Grandfather is just being gracious. Evelyn is still young."

Her words were meant to defend, but Evelyn knew better—they were orchestrating this.

Audrey, ever the provocateur, pulled Isabella forward. "Sir Edward, Isabella brought you a gift as well—an authentic Mercer. She went through great lengths to acquire it."

She thrust the painting toward Edward, but he didn’t take it.

Audrey froze. Isabella’s cheeks flushed. "Grandfather, happy birthday. If you like it, that’s all that matters. As for Evelyn’s painting… well, authenticity isn’t everything."

Edward’s tone turned frosty. "Ms. Davis, are you lecturing me now?"

His use of her surname was a clear dismissal.

Isabella’s lips trembled. She looked pleadingly at Nathaniel. "Nathaniel, you know I meant no disrespect. I turned down major contracts just to find this for Grandfather."

Nathaniel’s expression remained unreadable. He took the painting from Audrey and displayed it beside Evelyn’s.

The crowd gasped.

The two paintings were identical.

Nathaniel’s voice was calm as he addressed Edward. "Grandfather, Isabella put her heart into this. You can’t dismiss a lady’s effort so easily, can you?"

Edward remained silent, unmoved. Richard and Victoria exchanged glances but said nothing.

Nathaniel continued, "Isabella meant well. As for Evelyn’s painting—if you love it, keep it. Who are we to question that?"

Evelyn’s breath caught, her eyes locking onto Nathaniel’s in disbelief.

###Chapter 75

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, blinking against the light as she turned to find Nathaniel already awake, his dark eyes watching her with quiet intensity.

"You're up early," she murmured, stretching beneath the sheets.

Nathaniel's lips curved into a slow smile. "Couldn't sleep." His fingers brushed a loose strand of hair from her face, lingering just a moment too long.

Evelyn knew that look—something was on his mind. Before she could ask, his phone buzzed on the nightstand. He glanced at the screen, his expression tightening.

"Work?" she guessed.

"Samuel," he confirmed, exhaling sharply. "There's an issue with the Summit Realty deal."

Evelyn sat up, frowning. "I thought everything was finalized?"

"So did I." Nathaniel swung his legs over the edge of the bed, already reaching for his shirt. "Edward's pulling some last-minute demands."

She watched as he dressed with quick, efficient movements, the tension in his shoulders unmistakable. The Summit Realty acquisition had been months in the making, and Nathaniel had invested too much to let it slip away now.

"Need me to come with you?" she offered.

He paused, turning back to her. The hardness in his gaze softened slightly. "No, stay. You have that meeting with Gregory, remember?"

Right. The new project proposal. Evelyn nodded, though unease prickled at her. Something about the way Nathaniel had looked at his phone...

As if reading her thoughts, he leaned down, pressing a kiss to her forehead. "Don't worry. I'll handle it."

She forced a smile. "I know you will."

But the moment the door closed behind him, Evelyn reached for her own phone. A quick scroll through her messages revealed nothing unusual—just a reminder from Gabrielle about their afternoon meeting.

Yet the knot in her stomach refused to loosen.

The Martin Group offices hummed with subdued energy when Nathaniel arrived. Samuel was already waiting, his usual composed demeanor frayed at the edges.

"Edward's lawyers just sent over revised terms," Samuel said without preamble, handing Nathaniel a folder. "They're pushing for a higher stake."

Nathaniel flipped through the documents, his jaw tightening. "He's testing me."

Samuel hesitated. "There's more. Isabella Davis called. Twice."

Nathaniel's fingers stilled. "What did she want?"

"She wouldn't say. Just insisted it was urgent."

A muscle ticked in Nathaniel's jaw. Isabella had been silent for months—why reach out now?

"Tell her I'm busy," he said coldly.

Samuel nodded, but his expression was uneasy. "Sir... she mentioned Evelyn."

Nathaniel's head snapped up. "What about her?"

"That's all she said. Just that it concerned Evelyn."

The air in the office grew thick, charged with unspoken tension. Nathaniel's grip on the folder tightened.

"Get her on the phone."

Evelyn's meeting with Gregory had just ended when her phone buzzed. An unknown number flashed on the screen.

Frowning, she answered. "Hello?"

"Is this Evelyn Mitchell?" A woman's voice, smooth and calculated.

"Yes. Who is this?"

A pause. Then, laughter—soft, almost mocking. "Oh, you really don't know? I thought Nathaniel would have mentioned me by now."

Ice trickled down Evelyn's spine. "Isabella."

Another laugh. "Bingo. We need to talk. About your husband... and the secrets he's keeping from you."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her phone. "What do you want?"

"Meet me. Tonight. Alone." Isabella's voice dropped to a whisper. "Or you'll never know the truth."

The line went dead.

Evelyn stood frozen, the echo of Isabella's words ringing in her ears.

Secrets.

What had Nathaniel been hiding?

"What exactly are you implying? Does he believe my painting is counterfeit as well?" Evelyn let out a bitter laugh, her gaze distant, though a deep, unspoken sorrow flickered in her eyes.

"Does he truly love Isabella that much?" The thought twisted in her chest.

Edward noticed the shadow of pain in Evelyn's expression, but his tone remained sharp. "Whose idea was it to invite Ms. Davis to my birthday celebration? I don't recall her name being on the guest list."

His words struck like a blade. Tears pooled in Isabella's eyes, her face a portrait of wounded innocence.

"Grandfather, I know you adore Evelyn, and you're upset that Audrey exposed her deception. I don’t wish to embarrass Evelyn either, but if she was bold enough to deceive, shouldn’t she face the consequences? Or does your affection for her mean the rest of us must turn a blind eye?"

"Isabella, mind your tone with Grandfather." Nathaniel's expression darkened. He shot Isabella a warning glance before addressing Edward. "Grandfather, she didn’t mean any harm."

Edward scoffed. "Oh? So now you’re siding with an outsider to lecture me?"

"Grandfather—"

"Enough!" Edward snapped, his piercing gaze locking onto Isabella. "Ms. Davis, are you attempting to educate me on propriety?"

Richard and Victoria chimed in, their voices laced with suspicion. "Ms. Davis, what exactly are you playing at?"

"Isabella, apologize to Grandfather," Nathaniel commanded.

Though his words seemed chastising, everyone present knew he was shielding her.

Isabella pressed her lips into a thin line. "Nathaniel, I’ve done nothing wrong. I won’t apologize. The fault lies with Evelyn—she’s the one who should be begging for forgiveness."

Nathaniel’s expression turned stormy, the tension in the room thickening like fog.

The guests, all influential figures in the business world, exchanged hushed whispers. Though they respected—and feared—the Martins, murmurs began to circulate. Some accused the family of bullying Isabella. If Evelyn had deceived Edward with a forgery, shouldn’t she admit her mistake? It wasn’t fair to dismiss it simply because Edward favored her.

Evelyn’s lips pressed together. She had remained silent, unwilling to disrupt Edward’s celebration.

But now, she couldn’t stay quiet—not when these people were dragging the Martin name through the mud. They could blame her all they wanted, but not Edward, not the Martins.

Evelyn turned to Isabella and Audrey, her voice steady but edged with steel. "So, you genuinely believe this painting is fake?"

"Isn’t it?" Audrey lifted her chin defiantly.

Evelyn didn’t respond immediately, her gaze boring into Isabella instead.

Isabella’s eyes darted away, but she maintained her composure. "Evelyn, I understand you wanted to make Grandfather happy. No one would fault you for failing to acquire the original. But shouldn’t you own up to your mistake? An apology would go a long way."

Evelyn smirked. "So, if I apologize, all will be forgiven?"

"Of course. Admit your error, make amends, and Grandfather won’t hold it against you. Neither will anyone else."

"How generous of you, Ms. Davis."

Then, Evelyn’s expression shifted. She pulled out her phone and tapped the screen. "Grandfather, an old friend of mine wishes to extend his birthday greetings. Would you like to see his message?"

"Absolutely! Any friend of yours is a friend of mine." Edward grinned, as though the authenticity of the painting no longer mattered.

But William and Margaret were displeased. Margaret snapped, "Evelyn, what other tricks do you have up your sleeve? Apologize to Grandfather and everyone here at once. Are you determined to humiliate the entire Mitchell family?"

"I haven’t even spoken yet. Why so impatient? You may not know Evelyn, but I do," Edward retorted, his sharp glare silencing the room.

Evelyn’s heart swelled with warmth, a faint smile touching her lips.

Though Nathaniel didn’t believe her, the Martins had given her something rare—a sense of belonging, of protection.

She squeezed Edward’s arm gently. "Grandfather, don’t let them upset you. Sit down, please."

Then, she projected the video from her phone onto the large screen and pressed play.

"Mr. Martin, greetings. Julian Mercer here. Happy birthday! This painting was, in fact, taken from me by Evelyn. She said she wanted to gift it to her beloved grandfather. I had the pleasure of meeting you years ago and know you’re my greatest admirer. This piece is from my private collection, and I’d never part with it—except for Evelyn. Wishing you a splendid celebration, and I hope we can meet soon for a game of chess. She tells me you’re quite the opponent."

The video ended, but the impact lingered.

Most attendees recognized the man in the footage.

"That was Julian Mercer!" someone exclaimed. "The painting might be questioned, but you can’t fake a person. Why would anyone spread such rumors about Ms. Mitchell?"

The tide of opinion shifted instantly. Those who had been fueling the flames moments ago now backtracked hastily.

William and Margaret frowned. "Evelyn, you should have clarified earlier. You could’ve spared Grandfather this distress."

"Who said I’m distressed? I’m delighted," Edward interjected, irritation lacing his tone. He turned to Evelyn, his voice warm. "Evelyn, you’ve arranged for me to meet my idol! You know Julian personally and didn’t tell me? We must invite him for dinner."

"Of course. Next time I see him, I’ll extend the invitation. I doubt he’ll stand a chance against you in chess."

Edward chuckled, his joy palpable.

Then, someone voiced the lingering question. "Ms. Davis claimed her painting was genuine, but Ms. Mitchell’s has been verified. What does that make Ms. Davis’s?"

Audrey and Isabella tensed visibly.

Edward spoke coolly. "Ms. Davis, you and your friend have wronged Evelyn. Don’t you owe her an apology? Frankly, I couldn’t care less about your painting’s authenticity—nor will the Martins."

If they didn’t like it, it held no value to him.

Audrey’s parents swiftly intervened, scolding her before offering hurried apologies and dragging her away.

Isabella stood frozen, desperation creeping into her expression. Her eyes locked onto Nathaniel. "Nathaniel, I swear, I had no idea. I was deceived. I exhausted every resource to acquire it, but those people—they tricked me!"

Tears streamed down her face.

Nathaniel’s expression remained unreadable, his handsome features carved from ice.

Before he could speak, Evelyn cut in. "So, Ms. Davis, being scammed absolves you of accountability?"

"Evelyn... I truly was. Why are you being so hostile? Why must you humiliate me?"

"Now you’re blaming me, Ms. Davis?" Evelyn’s smile was razor-thin.

"Nathaniel, please," Isabella whimpered, clutching his sleeve. "Tell them the truth. I don’t understand how this happened. My head—it’s throbbing again. I can’t breathe. I feel ill."

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed. "Grandfather, Isabella didn’t act maliciously. I apologize on her behalf. Please, don’t be angry."

"Nathaniel, if Ms. Davis is at fault, she should apologize herself. Is she exempt from accountability?"

Evelyn met Nathaniel’s gaze squarely as she posed the question.

###Chapter 76

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden patterns across the bedroom floor. Evelyn stirred, blinking against the light, her body still heavy with sleep. Beside her, Nathaniel lay motionless, his breathing steady and deep.

She studied his face—the sharp line of his jaw, the faint shadow of stubble, the way his dark lashes fanned against his cheeks. Even in sleep, he exuded an air of quiet authority.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Mrs. Martin?" Alfred's voice was muffled through the wood. "Mr. Edward has requested your presence in the study."

Evelyn frowned. Edward rarely summoned her directly. Something must be wrong.

She slipped out of bed, careful not to wake Nathaniel, and dressed quickly in a simple blouse and slacks. The house was eerily silent as she made her way to the study, her footsteps muffled by the plush carpet.

Edward sat behind his massive oak desk, his expression unreadable. Winston stood beside him, his usual composed demeanor replaced by something tense.

"Evelyn," Edward greeted, his voice gravelly. "Sit down."

Her pulse quickened. "What's going on?"

Edward exchanged a glance with Winston before sliding a folder across the desk. "This arrived early this morning."

Evelyn opened it, her breath catching as she scanned the contents. Legal documents. A lawsuit filed against Martin Group—by Summit Realty.

Her stomach twisted. Sebastian Wilson was making his move.

"This is retaliation," she said, her fingers tightening on the papers. "Because we refused his offer."

Edward nodded grimly. "He's claiming breach of contract and intellectual property theft. He’s targeting Nathaniel personally."

Evelyn's mind raced. Nathaniel had been working tirelessly to restructure the company after his father's mismanagement. A scandal like this could undo everything.

"We need to act fast," she said, forcing her voice steady. "I’ll contact Gregory. He has connections in corporate law."

Edward leaned forward, his gaze piercing. "There’s more. Wilson isn’t working alone."

A chill ran down her spine. "Who else is involved?"

Before Edward could answer, the door burst open. Nathaniel stood in the doorway, his expression dark.

"I just got off the phone with Samuel," he said, his voice dangerously calm. "Isabella is back in the city."

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

And just like that, the game had changed.

Nathaniel's brows furrowed deeper. "Evelyn, why must you always escalate things? Can't you just let it go?"

"Escalate?" Evelyn's voice was soft but firm. "Nathaniel, where was this concern when Isabella was lying and making my life miserable?"

Even though she knew Nathaniel would always side with Isabella, the sting of his betrayal still cut deep. She pressed her lips together, reminding herself not to hope for what would never be hers.

The guests murmured among themselves, speculating that Nathaniel protected Isabella because of their shared past.

The room fell into an uneasy silence.

Edward rose with the support of his cane, his gaze icy. "Nathaniel, keep defending her, and you'll regret it one day," he warned.

With that, he took Evelyn's arm and led her away to their private quarters.

Once inside, Edward spoke gently, trying to soothe her. "Evelyn, that boy is the one who wronged you. Your grandfather knows you've been treated unfairly."

"Grandfather, I'm fine. I shouldn't have ruined your celebration."

"Nonsense! Today has been the happiest I've been in years, all because of you," Edward chuckled, pulling an ornate jewelry box from a drawer. "Here, take this."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "What is it?"

"Don't ask questions. Just take it."

Edward insisted, and Evelyn couldn't refuse. The box was locked, and he didn't give her the key, but she accepted it without hesitation.

After chatting for a while, Edward finally said, "Don't stay cooped up with me. Go enjoy yourself with your friends."

Evelyn nodded. She wasn’t in the mood for festivities, but she didn’t want Edward to worry.

Stepping outside, she avoided the banquet hall and instead placed the box in her car before wandering toward the garden by the pool. The night air was crisp, the stars shimmering above.

Images from earlier flashed through her mind—Nathaniel defending Isabella so fiercely, without hesitation, in front of everyone.

He was probably with her now.

And Evelyn? She was likely already forgotten.

She let out a bitter laugh and decided to tell Richard and Victoria she was leaving for Pineview Villa.

But as she stood, Isabella stormed toward her, eyes blazing.

That woman never knew when to quit.

Isabella stopped inches from her, voice dripping with venom. "Evelyn, what’s your game? Do you enjoy humiliating me? Thinking you’ve won? Dream on! Nathaniel’s heart belongs to me. You’re nothing. So what if the Martins like you? He’ll never love you. Divorce him now, or I’ll make sure you regret it."

Evelyn’s gaze turned glacial. "Isabella, are you seriously blaming me for your own mess? What gives you the right to demand I divorce Nathaniel? It’s our marriage, not yours."

Isabella could play the victim for Nathaniel, but Evelyn saw right through her.

Isabella’s lips curled into a sneer. "So, you want to play hardball? Fine. I have ways to make you obey."

Evelyn scoffed. "Who do you think you are? I don’t answer to you."

With that, she turned to leave—but a sudden shove sent her tumbling into the freezing pool.

Late autumn water pierced her skin like knives. She gasped, but water flooded her lungs instead of air.

She flailed, but the depth swallowed her. Darkness crept at the edges of her vision—until a shadowed figure dove in after her.

Half an hour later, Evelyn’s eyes fluttered open to a white ceiling.

"Evelyn, sweetheart, are you in pain?" Victoria’s gentle voice reached her.

She shook her head slightly, then jolted upright. "What happened?"

Victoria eased her back down. "You fell into the pool. Nathaniel pulled you out just in time. Dr. Harrison checked you—you’re fine."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. If Victoria didn’t mention anything worse, she was safe.

Glancing at the clock—past nine—she murmured, "You should go back to the guests. I’ll be alright."

"I’m not leaving you alone."

Evelyn managed a faint smile. "Did you say… Nathaniel saved me?"

"Yes. He was frantic. Only after Dr. Harrison assured him you were fine did he return to the party with Richard."

Evelyn knew Victoria might be exaggerating Nathaniel’s concern, but she didn’t argue.

Just then, the door swung open.

Nathaniel strode in, his expression unreadable. "How are you feeling?"

"I’m fine."

"Good." His voice softened. "But next time, don’t be so reckless. Isabella was only trying to help when you slipped. Was your pride worth nearly drowning?"

His words weren’t angry—just disappointed, as if scolding a child.

Evelyn’s face paled. Tears welled, but she swallowed them back.

Victoria interjected, "Nathaniel, stop. It was an accident."

Evelyn finally met his gaze, voice trembling. "Is that what she told you? That I fell?"

Nathaniel frowned. "You argued, lost your balance, and when she tried to help, you pushed her away."

Evelyn’s heart shattered. "You actually believe her?"

Silence.

Her nails dug into her palms. Answer me, Nathaniel.
###Chapter 77

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of our penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. I stretched beneath the silk sheets, my fingers brushing against the cold, empty space beside me. Nathaniel had already left for his early meeting at Martin Group headquarters.

My phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. Gabrielle's name flashed across the screen with three missed calls. Before I could react, it rang again.

"Evelyn! Thank God you're awake," Gabrielle's voice crackled with urgency. "The client from Summit Realty is waiting at the office. They moved the presentation up by two hours."

I bolted upright, sheets tangling around my legs. "What? That's impossible! The models aren't even finished being printed yet."

"I know, but Sebastian Wilson just stormed in with his entire team. They're demanding to see the revised waterfront development plans now."

My bare feet hit the cool floor as I scrambled toward the walk-in closet. "Stall them. Offer coffee, pastries, anything. I'll be there in twenty minutes."

The shower spray barely had time to warm before I was twisting my damp hair into a professional bun. My fingers trembled as I buttoned the tailored navy blazer Nathaniel had gifted me last month. The elevator ride down to the garage felt interminable.

Traffic crawled along the financial district. I drummed my fingers against the steering wheel, mentally rearranging my presentation points. My phone buzzed again - this time a text from Nathaniel: Heard about Summit's ambush. Sending Samuel with the prototype you left at home last night.

Relief flooded through me. Of course he'd remember. I'd been working on that miniature model until 2 AM, long after he'd fallen asleep with his reading glasses still on.

The elevator doors opened to chaos. Half a dozen unfamiliar suits clustered around our reception area, while Gabrielle frantically refilled a coffee carafe. Sebastian Wilson stood apart from his team, examining our framed blueprints with a critical eye.

"Mr. Wilson," I extended my hand with practiced calm. "What an unexpected pleasure."

His grip was firm, his smile not quite reaching his eyes. "Ms. Mitchell. We had some... scheduling conflicts come up. Hope this isn't too inconvenient."

Before I could respond, the elevator dinged again. Samuel emerged, impeccably dressed as always, carrying the carefully wrapped model under one arm. He nodded discreetly to me before addressing Sebastian. "Mr. Wilson, Mr. Martin sends his regards. He thought you might appreciate seeing the latest iterations in person."

Sebastian's eyebrows lifted. "Nathaniel Martin is involved in this project?"

"Not officially," I interjected smoothly. "But as my husband, he occasionally offers... creative consultation."

The tension in the room shifted palpably. Sebastian's posture straightened, his gaze reassessing me with new interest. "Shall we begin the presentation then? I'm eager to see what the famous Martin touch has contributed."

As I led the group toward the conference room, Gabrielle caught my elbow. "Vanessa called three times while you were en route," she whispered. "Isabella's apparently throwing some charity gala next month and wants you to design the venue."

I nearly tripped over my own feet. Isabella Davis, Nathaniel's ex-fiancée, hadn't spoken to me since our wedding. Why now? And why me?

The answer hit me as I arranged my materials at the head of the conference table. This wasn't about architecture. This was a move in whatever game Isabella was playing. And judging by the predatory gleam in Sebastian's eyes as he took his seat, I was about to be pulled into multiple battles at once.

The morning sunlight no longer felt warm. It felt like a spotlight.

Silence. That was all she received in return.

Evelyn sensed something was wrong immediately. "Nathaniel," she said softly, "I believe you. Tell me what really happened."

Nathaniel's lips pressed into a thin line, his dark eyes locked onto Isabella. His heart sank like a stone.

See now, Evelyn? she thought bitterly. This is who he truly cares about. Stop deluding yourself.

Drawing a deep breath, Evelyn spoke quietly. "Nathaniel, whether you believe me or not, I didn’t throw myself down those stairs. Isabella pushed me. But of course, you’ll take her word over mine. Nothing I say has ever mattered to you."

Without waiting for a response, she turned to Victoria. "Victoria, I want to go back to Pineview Villa. I’m fine—don’t worry about me. Today was supposed to be Edward’s birthday, and yet everything somehow became about me. I’m sorry."

Victoria’s expression softened. "Don’t be ridiculous, child. You’re family. Richard, Edward, and I all stand with you." She shot Nathaniel a sharp look. "Take her home."

"No," Evelyn refused instantly. "I’ll go alone."

She threw off the covers and stood, her movements quick and decisive. She didn’t spare Nathaniel another glance.

Watching her pale, defiant face, Nathaniel’s expression darkened further, his brows knitting together.

As Evelyn drove away from Martin Manor, the emptiness in her chest expanded. She had known Nathaniel’s favoritism toward Isabella, yet she had still foolishly sought his validation.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips.

One year of marriage, and not an ounce of trust. How pathetic.

"Evelyn Mitchell," she whispered to herself, "you’re a fool."

Back at the manor, Victoria glared at Nathaniel. "What is wrong with you? Has Isabella cast some spell over you? You trust her over your own wife?"

Nathaniel remained silent, his face unreadable. Victoria, too furious to speak, stormed off after shooting him several withering looks.

Nathaniel stood motionless for a long moment, Isabella’s beautiful face haunting his thoughts. He knew exactly what she was capable of.

After a tense silence, he left the room and sought out Winston, demanding to see the security footage near the pool.

The recording made his jaw tighten, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.

Without hesitation, he deleted the footage and headed for the garage.

"Nathaniel, are you leaving? Could you give me a ride?"

Isabella’s soft, pleading voice reached him just as he was about to get into his car.

He turned to see her approaching, Audrey trailing behind her. Isabella’s hopeful gaze locked onto his, waiting.

Nathaniel said nothing, his expression blank.

His silence sent a ripple of panic through Isabella, though she forced herself to remain composed.

As other guests began to leave, witnessing the awkward exchange, Isabella felt her pride crumbling. She released Audrey’s hand and stepped forward. "Nathaniel, why won’t you answer me?"

She turned to Audrey. "Go ahead. I’ll leave with Nathaniel."

Audrey nodded, flashing Nathaniel a polite smile. "Mr. Martin, make sure she gets home safely."

Still, Nathaniel gave no response. Audrey left quickly, discomfort evident in her hurried steps.

Isabella swallowed hard. "Nathaniel, what’s wrong?"

"Call your manager to pick you up."

His voice was ice. He barely glanced at her before sliding into his car and driving away.

Isabella stood frozen, disbelief turning her cheeks pale.

The whispers started immediately.

"Looks like Isabella isn’t as close to Mr. Martin as she claims."

"Did you see how cold he was? It’s obvious he doesn’t care for her."

"The Martins clearly prefer Evelyn. I doubt Isabella will ever marry into that family."

Their words, deliberately loud enough for her to hear, made her fists clench.

This was all Evelyn’s fault. She must have poisoned Nathaniel against her.

Forced to call Vanessa for a ride, Isabella seethed—until she spotted Sophia approaching.

The two women locked eyes, hostility crackling between them.

Sophia’s voice was dripping with disdain. "Isabella, don’t you know Nathaniel is married? Your desperation is disgusting."

Isabella smirked. "Oh? And what about your feelings for him? Don’t pretend you aren’t jealous of Evelyn. How does it feel to want a man who’s now your brother-in-law?"

Sophia’s composure flickered, but she lifted her chin. "Unlike you, I have boundaries. If you hurt my sister, the Mitchells won’t let it slide."

Isabella laughed coldly. "Your sister? Please. We both know how your family treats her. You stole everything from her—you are the real betrayer."

Sophia’s face went rigid.

As Isabella walked away, Sophia stood frozen, her mind flooded with memories she’d tried to bury.

The truth was a blade, and it cut deep.

###Chapter 78

The moment Nathaniel stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, the air shifted. His presence commanded attention, his sharp features set in a mask of cool indifference. But Evelyn knew better—she could see the storm brewing in his stormy gray eyes.

"Evelyn," he said, his voice low and controlled. "We need to talk."

She swallowed hard, her fingers tightening around the blueprints in her hands. "Now isn't the best time, Nathaniel. I have a meeting with Gregory in twenty minutes."

His jaw clenched. "This can't wait."

Before she could protest, he took her wrist—gently, but with enough firmness to make it clear he wasn’t asking. He guided her into the private study, shutting the door behind them with a quiet click.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "What’s going on?"

Nathaniel ran a hand through his dark hair, frustration evident in the gesture. "Isabella is back."

The name sent a jolt through her. Isabella Davis—Nathaniel’s first love, the woman who had once held his heart before Evelyn came into the picture.

"And?" Evelyn forced her voice to remain steady. "What does that have to do with us?"

His gaze darkened. "She’s been spreading rumors. About you. About us."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. "What kind of rumors?"

"That our marriage is a sham. That you only married me for the Martin name and fortune."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "That’s ridiculous."

"Is it?" Nathaniel stepped closer, his eyes searching hers. "Because people are starting to talk, Evelyn. And if this gets out, it could damage your reputation—and the company."

She stiffened. "I don’t care what people think."

"You should." His voice dropped to a whisper. "Because I do."

The raw honesty in his words caught her off guard. For a moment, the mask slipped, and she saw the vulnerability beneath—the man who had fought so hard to protect what they had.

Evelyn reached out, her fingers brushing his. "Then we’ll handle it together."

Nathaniel’s grip tightened around her hand. "Isabella won’t stop easily. She’s determined to ruin this."

A slow, defiant smile curved Evelyn’s lips. "Let her try."

Outside, the wind howled, rattling the windows like a warning. But inside, the fire burned bright—and so did their resolve.

The game had just begun.

Evelyn stood waiting until Nathaniel and Isabella arrived.

The trio got into the car and headed back to the Mitchell Manor.

Margaret voiced her displeasure. "What's with Isabella? She knows someone as prestigious as Julian Mercer and didn’t even mention it. We were humiliated in front of everyone. If this gets out, people might think we’re mistreating her. And why did she gift that painting to Edward in her own name? It should’ve been from the Mitchell family."

"Why are you always so cold toward Evelyn, Mom?" Sophia challenged before Margaret could finish.

Silence filled the car.

Margaret turned sharply. "What are you talking about?"

Sophia met her gaze steadily. "Isn’t Evelyn your daughter too? Why do you and Dad publicly doubt her? Doesn’t she belong to this family?"

Her words left both Margaret and William speechless.

After a long pause, Margaret softened her tone. "Sophia, did she complain to you?"

"No."

"Sophia, you’ve grown up surrounded by love. You’re kind-hearted, and I understand your concern. But this time, Evelyn didn’t consider the family’s reputation—"

"Mom!" Sophia cut in sharply. "Evelyn hasn’t said a word. I just see how you treat her. Is this because of me?"

Sophia didn’t know the real reason behind Margaret’s coldness, so she blamed herself.

She disliked Evelyn’s aloofness—her unshakable pride, even under pressure.

Yet, she envied her.

For her honesty, for needing no pretenses.

Nathaniel didn’t go to the office. Instead, he drove straight to Pineview Villa.

He strode upstairs and pushed open the bedroom door.

The dim light revealed a slight figure curled beneath the sheets. He flicked on the lamp, hesitated, then murmured, "Evelyn... wake up. We need to talk."

It wasn’t late enough to disturb her rest, but she didn’t stir.

Frowning, he reached out to nudge her cheek. The moment his cold fingers brushed her burning skin, alarm shot through him. He pressed a palm to her forehead—scorching.

"Evelyn, you’re burning up. We need to get you to the hospital."

Her head throbbed, her body heavy. She barely cracked her eyes open before swatting his hand away. "Leave me alone."

Startled by her sharpness, Nathaniel scooped her up. "At least take medicine. You can’t ignore this."

Evelyn finally glared at him, irritation flaring. "I don’t want medicine. My health is my business. If you’re so concerned, go check on Isabella."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened.

She didn’t spare him another glance, collapsing back onto the bed.

But the fever raged through the night. Despite her refusal, Nathaniel tried cooling her with a damp cloth—useless.

By dawn, he called Dr. Harrison. Aware of her pregnancy, the doctor prescribed safe medication and stressed hydration.

When Evelyn woke, Nathaniel was already beside her, holding a glass of water and pills.

Weak and flushed, her lashes fluttered as she registered his presence.

"Take these," he urged. "The kitchen’s making soup."

"No."

"Evelyn, don’t be stubborn. You’ve been feverish all night. Dr. Harrison said—"

At the doctor’s name, her expression flickered—then hardened at the sight of Nathaniel.

"I’ll take them later," she said icily.

"Evelyn, what’s this about?"

Her sickly calm cracked. "You accuse me of making trouble when I’ve done nothing. Is Isabella the only one allowed to be perfect?"

"Why bring her up?"

"Because she’s always the answer, isn’t she?" Her laugh was brittle.

Nathaniel exhaled, offering the water. "Take the pills first. Then we’ll talk."

"I can do it myself. Put them down."

"Evelyn, must I force you?"

"I said I’ll take them!"

His patience snapped. He set the glass aside and hauled her against him. She stiffened, his scent enveloping her, her hands shoving uselessly at his chest.

Water sloshed onto the sheets, soaking them both.

Finally, stillness.

Evelyn wrenched free, coolly repeating, "I’ll take them later."

She slipped out of bed and vanished into the bathroom.

Nathaniel ignored her rejection.

She was his wife. Caring for her wasn’t optional.

His gaze lingered on the closed door before he left just as she emerged.

Evelyn’s illness dragged on, their interactions strained. Nathaniel tried; she remained indifferent.

Too drained to care, she barely registered Caroline’s early call.

"Isabella’s the laughingstock of the circle after Edward’s party," Caroline crowed. "She stole endorsements, and now karma’s biting back."

Evelyn sighed. "She brought it on herself."

"True." Caroline paused. "Feeling better?"

"Much."

Work had stalled. Pregnancy demanded caution.

Isabella’s drama meant nothing—just gossip to forget.

Caroline hesitated. "Evelyn… are you and Nathaniel not divorcing? Will you tell him about the baby? It’ll be obvious soon. He’s your husband—doesn’t he suspect?"

###Chapter 79

The moment I stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, the weight of Nathaniel’s absence pressed down on me. The chandeliers glittered overhead, casting golden light over the marble floors, but the opulence did nothing to ease the tightness in my chest.

"Evelyn."

I turned to find Edward Martin standing by the fireplace, his sharp gaze assessing me. The patriarch of the Martin family had always been an imposing figure, but tonight, there was something different in his expression—something unreadable.

"Mr. Martin," I greeted, forcing a polite smile.

"You look troubled," he observed, his voice low.

I hesitated. How much did he know? Nathaniel had been distant for days, ever since Isabella had resurfaced in his life. The woman who had once held his heart now threatened to unravel everything we had built.

Before I could respond, the doors swung open, and Nathaniel strode in, his presence commanding the room. His dark suit accentuated his broad shoulders, but his eyes—those piercing blue eyes—were cold, distant.

"Evelyn," he acknowledged me with a curt nod before turning to his grandfather. "We need to talk."

Edward’s lips thinned. "Not here."

The tension between them was palpable, and I clenched my fists at my sides. Whatever was happening, I was being shut out—again.

Isabella chose that moment to make her entrance, her crimson dress clinging to her curves, her smile dripping with false sweetness. "Nathaniel," she purred, brushing past me as if I were invisible.

A muscle ticked in Nathaniel’s jaw, but he didn’t push her away.

My stomach twisted.

"Excuse me," I murmured, turning on my heel before I could witness whatever would happen next.

The gardens outside were quiet, the night air cool against my flushed skin. I exhaled shakily, my breath forming a mist in the crisp air.

"Running away?"

I stiffened at the familiar voice. Vanessa, Isabella’s ever-loyal agent, leaned against a stone pillar, smirking.

"Just getting some air," I replied evenly.

She pushed off the pillar, stepping closer. "You know, it’s only a matter of time before he realizes he never stopped loving her."

I met her gaze, refusing to flinch. "And you’re here to deliver the message?"

Vanessa shrugged. "Just stating facts."

Before I could retort, my phone buzzed. A message from Gregory: We have a problem. The Summit Realty deal is falling apart. Call me.

My heart sank. Another crisis.

I glanced back at the estate, where Nathaniel stood framed in the doorway, his expression unreadable.

One thing was clear—I couldn’t rely on him anymore.

Not when Isabella was back in the picture.

And not when everything I’d fought for was crumbling around me.

Caroline's question darkened Evelyn's expression.

Truth be told, Nathaniel had touched her belly before—not realizing she was pregnant, merely thinking she'd gained weight. His fingers had lingered, tracing the soft curve as he murmured, "I like this. It's comforting."

Even as their relationship cooled in recent days, his hand always found its way to her waist by morning.

If only he'd paid closer attention, he might have noticed the changes. But his heart had never truly been hers, so he remained oblivious.

"Maybe we'll have parted ways before it becomes impossible to hide," Evelyn replied flatly. "Why complicate things now?"

The one not loved—everything they do is an annoyance anyway, she thought bitterly.

Meanwhile, in another Mayby-owned building, Isabella was dragged to the company at dawn by Vanessa. The past few days had been rough. The entertainment industry was ruthless—one misstep, and vultures circled.

Vanessa slid an invitation across the table. "Dinner tonight with the sponsor. Secure this, and your new song's disastrous rollout might recover."

"No." Isabella didn't hesitate. "Vincent Rossi is revolting. I'd rather starve."

The humiliation from Edward Martin's birthday still stung, but she refused to debase herself further.

Vanessa's patience frayed. "Isabella, we need this. It's just dinner. I'll be there the whole time."

"I'm the 'girl next door,'" Isabella snapped. "What if paparazzi catch me with that creep?"

A tense silence fell. Vanessa inhaled sharply—Isabella was her golden goose, but even geese could be plucked.

Finally, Vanessa leaned in, voice honeyed. "These past days, the entire industry's laughed at you. And Nathaniel? Radio silence. Is this really how you want things?"

Isabella stiffened.

She had reached out to Nathaniel, but his responses were tepid. Was it the birthday fiasco? Something Evelyn said? Nothing she tried worked.

Her nails dug into her palms. "What do you suggest?"

Vanessa whispered her plan. Isabella's eyes gleamed. "Just making him jealous is boring. I want everyone who mocked me to see how much he cares."

Vanessa opened her mouth—then closed it. Some battles weren't worth fighting.

That evening, Isabella arrived at the sponsor's chosen restaurant.

Vincent's gaze crawled over her. "Ms. Davis, exquisite as ever. I do hope we can... align our interests."

The implication hung thick.

Isabella's smile stayed plastered as his secretary simpered, "Mr. Rossi is very generous to those who please him. A collaboration would be... mutually beneficial."

Vanessa jumped in. "We're honored by your interest, Mr. Rossi!"

Isabella sipped her wine, seething. Even with her modest fame, capital demanded kneeling.

To mask her disgust, Vanessa kept her drinking. Glass after glass, until Isabella's head spun.

Then—the cue.

Vanessa excused herself, dialing Nathaniel. "Mr. Martin, it's Vanessa. Apologies for the late call."

His voice was ice. "What?"

"Isabella's drunk. Could you fetch her? With her image right now, if paparazzi catch her like this..."

"That's your job." He sounded ready to hang up.

Panicked, Vanessa glimpsed through the door—Vincent's hand sliding up Isabella's shoulder. "Mr. Martin, please. The sponsor's getting handsy. I'm scared he'll—"

A beat of silence.

Then: "Location."

She rattled off the address. "We'll wait outside."

Nathaniel stood by the bedroom window, phone clenched. The call left him unsettled.

The bathroom door opened. Evelyn emerged, towel-drying her hair.

"Going out?" she asked absently.

His jaw tightened. Her recent coldness made the lie stick in his throat. "Thomas set up an urgent meeting."

"Mm."

Gathering his coat, he left Pineview Villa, unease coiling in his gut. Why had he lied?

The truth would upset her—make her withdraw further. These days with her had revealed a side of Evelyn he didn't recognize: distant, untouchable. And he hated it.

At the restaurant, Nathaniel parked but didn't exit.

Vanessa half-dragged Isabella outside, two men hovering.

Then—Vincent reached for Isabella.

Nathaniel slammed the car door.

Vanessa waved frantically. "Mr. Martin!"

Isabella's head lifted. Seeing him, she wrenched free and stumbled forward, collapsing against his chest.

He caught her automatically.

Her arms locked around his waist, face buried in his shirt. "Nathaniel," she slurred, voice thick with tears. "You've ignored me for weeks. Are you angry with me?"

###Chapter 80

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work, his side of the bed cool to the touch. She sighed, stretching before sitting up.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory.

"Emergency meeting at the office. We need you here ASAP."

Evelyn frowned. She had planned to spend the morning reviewing the final blueprints for the Martin Group’s new project. Something must have gone wrong.

She dressed quickly, opting for a sleek black pantsuit—her armor for the day. As she fastened her watch, her gaze lingered on the framed photo on the dresser. It was from their wedding day, Nathaniel’s arms wrapped around her waist, his smile bright against the sunset.

A sharp knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called.

Alfred, their butler, stepped inside. "Madam, your car is ready."

"Thank you, Alfred." She grabbed her bag and headed downstairs.

The drive to the office was tense. Evelyn tapped her fingers against the steering wheel, her mind racing through possible scenarios. Had the client backed out? Was there an issue with the permits?

When she arrived, the conference room was already packed. Gregory stood at the head of the table, his expression grim. Gabrielle, her assistant, handed her a folder the moment she walked in.

"What’s going on?" Evelyn asked, flipping it open.

Gregory exhaled sharply. "Summit Realty just pulled out of the deal. They’re taking their investment elsewhere."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. Summit Realty was their biggest client. Without them, the entire project was at risk.

"Why?" she demanded.

Gabrielle hesitated. "Rumors are spreading. They think the Martins are unstable after… recent events."

Evelyn clenched her jaw. Recent events. The media had been relentless since Isabella’s sudden reappearance in Nathaniel’s life.

She closed the folder with a snap. "Call Sebastian Wilson. I want a meeting set up by the end of the day."

Gregory raised an eyebrow. "You think he’ll listen?"

"He will," Evelyn said, her voice steady. "Because I’m not letting this fall apart."

As she strode out of the room, her phone buzzed again. This time, it was Nathaniel.

"We need to talk. Tonight."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the phone. Whatever was coming, she wasn’t ready. But she had no choice.

The game was far from over.

Nathaniel's expression was icy as he stated flatly, "You're drunk."

"I'm perfectly sober. Don't you love me anymore? How can you be so cruel, ignoring me like this?"

Isabella's voice cracked into sobs as she gazed up at Nathaniel's sharp jawline, rising onto her toes to kiss him.

"Isabella, get in the car. I'll take you home."

Just as she leaned in, Nathaniel deftly sidestepped her, turning to open the passenger door with an unreadable expression. His tone left no room for argument.

Isabella hesitated, acutely aware of Vincent and the others watching from behind. Reluctantly, she slid into the seat, her pride stinging.

Unseen by them, a black van idled by the curb. Inside, a camera lens focused, capturing the intimate moment between the two at the perfect angle.

Vanessa spotted Isabella entering the car and quickly excused herself from Vincent. "Mr. Rossi, Mr. Martin is here to pick up Isabella. We'll be leaving now."

Vincent's face paled as he glared at his assistant. "Didn't you tell me Nathaniel had cut ties with her? Why is he here now? Are you trying to turn him against me and ruin everything?"

He knew better than to challenge Nathaniel.

Vanessa didn’t ride with them. Instead, she followed in her own car.

The drive was silent. Isabella, who hadn’t actually drunk much, sobered up quickly under Nathaniel’s cold demeanor.

When they arrived at Cedar Heights, the car rolled to a smooth stop.

Only then did Isabella dare to speak. "Nathaniel... thank you for bringing me home."

"It’s nothing. Try not to drink so much next time. A lady shouldn’t involve herself in these damaging social games, understood?"

"I know. It won’t happen again."

Isabella nodded, lifting her gaze cautiously.

But Nathaniel’s eyes remained fixed ahead, his sharp cheekbones casting shadows that made him look even more distant. Gathering her courage, she whispered, "Nathaniel... are you ending things with me?"

His brow twitched slightly before he finally turned to look at her.

"It's late. Go inside and rest." His voice was cool, detached.

"Nathaniel, why won’t you answer me? When I woke up, you promised to marry me. Why haven’t you mentioned it since? Is it because of Evelyn? Are you pushing me away for her?"

Her voice trembled, her fists clenched tightly in her lap.

Their eyes locked. Nathaniel’s gaze remained unreadable, his tone steady. "Isabella, this has nothing to do with Evelyn. I’m just disappointed in what you did."

Relief flickered through her at his words. "Nathaniel, I swear I’ve learned my lesson. Please, just forgive me this once?"

Silence.

Isabella refused to back down.

Tears spilled down her cheeks as she whispered, "Nathaniel, did you come for me tonight because of what happened a year ago? If you don’t want to marry me, just say it. I’ll leave Mayby. I won’t bother you anymore."

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened dangerously. "Is that a threat, Isabella?"

She froze.

"No! You misunderstand—I just—"

"Enough." His voice cut through her stammering. "I don’t respond to threats. What I promised you still stands. Just don’t test my patience again."

Isabella jerked her head in a quick nod. "I understand. I won’t disappoint you."

Nathaniel’s expression softened marginally. "Good. Get some rest. I’m leaving."

This time, she didn’t argue. His moods were too unpredictable, and she couldn’t risk pushing him further.

Back in her apartment, she dialed Vanessa. Before she could speak, the other woman asked, "Did Mr. Martin stay with you?"

"Release the footage we got tonight. Make sure it trends by morning."

Isabella’s voice was cold, calculated.

She would use this scandal to cement the illusion of her relationship with Nathaniel. Even if he denied it later, the damage would be done. And Evelyn? She’d make sure the woman knew exactly who held Nathaniel’s heart.

The next morning, the affair between Nathaniel and Isabella exploded across social media.

Nathaniel’s phone rang incessantly.

Samuel’s voice was tense on the other end. "Mr. Martin, the rumors are everywhere. Should we take them down?"

"Unless you’d like to explain why I pay you?" Nathaniel’s tone was frigid.

Evelyn noticed his irritation. After he hung up, she asked, "What’s wrong?"

"Nothing."

She didn’t press further, finishing her breakfast before heading to the office, fully recovered from her cold.

But as she moved to leave, Nathaniel suddenly suggested, "Why not rest another day?"

"No. I’m bored at home, and the project can’t wait. I won’t let it fall behind."

As the lead architect, the entire construction depended on her.

Nathaniel fell silent, something unreadable flickering in his eyes before he let it go.

At the office, Gregory’s expression was grim. When their eyes met, Evelyn frowned. "Gregory, why are you looking at me like that?"

"Let’s talk in your office."

She nodded, puzzled.

Once inside, Gregory shut the door and lowered his voice. "Evelyn, what is Nathaniel playing at? He’s stringing you along with this marriage while openly dating Isabella. Does he even respect you?"

Evelyn blinked. "What?"

"You didn’t know?" Gregory’s frown deepened as he pulled out his phone, showing her a screenshot. "This was taken last night outside a restaurant. It trended this morning before being taken down, but the buzz is still everywhere. I can’t believe Nathaniel didn’t tell you."

Evelyn barely heard him. Her entire focus was on the headline glaring from the screen:

"Martin Group’s Nathaniel Personally Escorts Isabella Home—Returning to Their Love Nest?"

The timestamp? Early this morning. When Nathaniel had supposedly been out with Thomas.

Her stomach twisted.

So last night, when he said he had plans with Thomas… he was really with Isabella?

And the call this morning—was it about this?

His suggestion that she stay home… was it to keep her from finding out?

A bitter laugh threatened to escape.

Nathaniel. Just how many lies have you told me?

###Chapter 81

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, blinking against the light, her body still heavy with sleep. Beside her, Nathaniel lay motionless, his breathing steady, his arm draped protectively over her waist.

She studied his face—the sharp line of his jaw, the faint stubble shadowing his cheeks, the way his dark lashes rested against his skin. Even in sleep, he exuded an air of quiet authority.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Mrs. Martin?" Alfred's voice was muffled through the wood. "Breakfast is ready."

Evelyn sighed, reluctantly slipping out from under Nathaniel's arm. She padded to the door, opening it just enough to see the butler's composed expression.

"Thank you, Alfred. We'll be down shortly."

Closing the door, she turned back to the bed—only to find Nathaniel watching her, his dark eyes already alert.

"Morning," he murmured, his voice rough with sleep.

"Morning," she echoed, unable to suppress a smile.

He reached for her, pulling her back into the warmth of the sheets. "Five more minutes."

She laughed, but didn't resist.

Downstairs, the dining room was bathed in sunlight. Rosalind, their new chef, had outdone herself—fluffy pancakes, fresh fruit, and a pot of steaming coffee awaited them.

Evelyn took a sip of her coffee, savoring the rich flavor. "So, what's on your agenda today?"

Nathaniel glanced at his phone, scrolling through messages. "Meeting with Daniel Carter about the waterfront project. Then lunch with Thomas."

She nodded. "I have a site visit this afternoon. Gregory wants to go over the final blueprints before we submit them."

Nathaniel's expression darkened slightly at the mention of Gregory. "I still don't trust him."

Evelyn sighed. "He's my business partner, Nathaniel. You don't have to like him, but you do have to tolerate him."

Before he could respond, his phone buzzed. He frowned at the screen.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Edward wants to see me." His tone was clipped.

Evelyn set down her fork. "About?"

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "He didn't say."

She reached across the table, squeezing his hand. "Whatever it is, we'll handle it together."

His grip tightened around hers. "Always."

Later that afternoon, Evelyn stood at the construction site, reviewing the plans with Gregory. The wind tugged at her hair, and she absently tucked a loose strand behind her ear.

"Everything looks good," Gregory said, nodding. "We should be ready to break ground next week."

Evelyn smiled. "Perfect."

Her phone buzzed in her pocket. Pulling it out, she saw a message from Nathaniel:

We need to talk. Meet me at home.

Her stomach twisted. Something was wrong.

Gregory noticed her expression. "Everything okay?"

She forced a smile. "Fine. I just need to head back early."

As she drove home, her mind raced. What had Edward said to him? What had changed in just a few hours?

When she walked through the front door, Nathaniel was waiting in the study, his back to her as he stared out the window.

"Nathaniel?"

He turned slowly, his face unreadable.

"We have a problem."

The way he said it sent a chill down her spine.

"What kind of problem?"

His jaw tightened. "Isabella's back."

Evelyn's breath caught.

And just like that, the peaceful morning felt like a lifetime ago.

Evelyn's heart had grown numb long ago. The knowledge that the man she loved was in love with someone else wasn’t new to her, yet somehow, that numbness still carried a dull ache.

When she remained silent for too long, Gregory leaned forward, concern etching his features. "Evelyn, why do you keep torturing yourself like this? What exactly is Nathaniel playing at?"

She lifted her gaze and handed him her phone, her voice steady. "Let’s focus on work. I’ve been away for days, and there’s a lot to catch up on. Gabrielle and I need to visit the site later. You handle things here."

She deliberately shifted the conversation, avoiding Gregory’s question and making it clear she had no intention of discussing it further.

Gregory’s brows knitted together, his expression darkening slightly. "Evelyn, did you even hear what I said?"

"Gregory, I know you care, but we’re at work. Let’s not talk about personal matters, alright?"

She offered him a reassuring smile, as if to prove she was fine—truly fine.

In truth, the suffocating weight in her chest wasn’t as crushing as before. Evelyn had known Nathaniel didn’t love her even before their marriage. Everything that followed had only helped her adjust to that reality.

She told herself she would be okay.

Gregory didn’t press further. Though worry gnawed at him, he refused to make her uncomfortable.

Evelyn threw herself into work. After organizing her files, she left for the construction site with Gabrielle.

At the Martin Group’s executive floor, the air was thick with tension. Nathaniel sat behind his desk, his expression icy, his sharp gaze radiating a chilling intensity.

Samuel knocked and entered. "Mr. Martin, I’ve investigated the situation. Those gossip accounts stirring up rumors are linked to a small firm registered last year. Our legal team is handling it. Also, Ms. Davis’s agent, Vanessa, called. She wants to explain the situation to you."

"Don’t respond. Have the trending topic removed and issue a company-wide notice—no stories about me are to trend again."

"Understood."

Samuel nodded, stealing a glance at Nathaniel’s stormy expression.

As he turned to leave, Nathaniel’s deep voice stopped him. "And her? Any updates?"

"Her?" Samuel hesitated before realizing. "Ah—Mrs. Martin and her assistant have gone to the construction site."

"Has she called or made any move?"

"No," Samuel answered softly.

Nathaniel’s frown deepened. He dismissed Samuel with a wave, then strode to the floor-to-ceiling window, staring down at the city below. Something had lodged itself deep in his chest, an undeniable mark he couldn’t ignore.

He grabbed his phone and dialed. After several rings, she answered.

"It’s me," he said.

"I know. What is it?" Her voice was cool.

His jaw tightened. After a beat, he spoke in a low voice. "I’m not dating Isabella. The trending story was fabricated."

"I see." Her response was clipped.

His grip on the phone tightened. "Evelyn, don’t you have anything else to say to me?"

"No. After all, your relationship with Isabella has nothing to do with us, right?"

She threw his own words back at him.

Nathaniel’s lips pressed into a thin line. "Are you angry?"

"No."

"Evelyn, I lied to you last night. But I didn’t mean anything by it. Isabella was having dinner with a sponsor who got out of line. Vanessa couldn’t handle it, so she called me. Nothing inappropriate happened."

"I understand," she replied, indifferent.

Her coldness stung. His voice turned sharp. "Evelyn, what are you saying? Does that mean you don’t care if something did happen between me and Isabella?"

Evelyn sighed, exasperated. "Nathaniel, what do you want from me? Should I throw a tantrum and demand answers? If I did, you’d tell me to behave. I’ve been compliant, and now you’re upset because I’m too indifferent. So tell me—what exactly do you expect?"

Nathaniel scoffed. "So all these excuses are just to prove you don’t care, is that it? Would it even matter to you if something did happen?"

Anger flared in his voice. He didn’t wait for her response. "Evelyn, you’re doing great. I’m the one making a fuss over nothing."

The line went dead.

Evelyn stared at her phone, frustration simmering.

She didn’t understand why he had called just to say these things.

She had done exactly what he wanted—kept her distance, stayed out of his affairs. And yet, he was still dissatisfied.

She sighed. Love was absent, so nothing she did would ever please him.

Before she could dwell on it, Gabrielle rushed over. "Ms. Mitchell, Mr. Carter needs you."

Evelyn followed, pushing all thoughts of Nathaniel aside. Work demanded her attention now.

After the trending topic was removed, Isabella received the news immediately.

But it wasn’t all bad. Since morning, Vanessa’s phone had been ringing nonstop. Sponsors who had previously ignored her were now extending offers. In just a few hours, she had secured multiple deals.

With her new song about to drop and brands clamoring for endorsements, Isabella was winning.

Still, Vanessa hesitated. "What if Mr. Martin releases a statement denying any relationship?"

That could ruin everything.

Isabella shrugged. "He removed the trending topic, which implies we’re not dating, but he didn’t deny a connection." She smirked. "Order lunch from Scarlett. I’m taking it to Nathaniel at the Martin Group."

"What if someone takes pictures of you there?"

"I’m just delivering lunch. What can I do if they snap photos?"

Vanessa had no choice but to comply.

At half past eleven, Isabella arrived at the Martin Group lobby. The receptionist recognized her immediately and treated her with deference.

She took the elevator to Nathaniel’s floor. The moment she stepped out, Samuel spotted her and hurried over. "Ms. Davis, what brings you here?"

"I brought Nathaniel lunch. Is he in his office?"

Samuel hesitated. "He is, but—"

"I’ll see him myself. You can go."

She brushed past him and knocked on Nathaniel’s door.

"Come in," came his curt reply.

She entered, placing the food on the coffee table before approaching his desk. "Nathaniel, take a break. Have some lunch."

He looked up, his expression unreadable. "Isabella? What are you doing here?"

"I wanted to apologize for last night. Bringing you lunch is the least I could do. You’re not upset with me, are you?"

She gazed at him expectantly.

Nathaniel studied her, his eyes cool and detached. Finally, he spoke. "Isabella, just because I didn’t expose what really happened doesn’t mean I don’t know everything. But let me make one thing clear—I don’t want a repeat of last night. Take what you brought and leave. Now."

###Chapter 82

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of our penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. I stretched beneath the silk sheets, my fingers brushing against the empty space where Nathaniel should have been. The cold sheets confirmed he'd left hours ago—again.

My phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. Gabrielle's name flashed across the screen. "Evelyn, the client moved the meeting to 10 AM. And Mr. Wilson needs those blueprints revised before noon."

I groaned, rubbing sleep from my eyes. Another chaotic day at Mitchell & Wilson Architects. The Martin Group project deadline loomed like a storm cloud, and Nathaniel's recent distance wasn't helping my concentration.

The penthouse felt eerily silent as I padded to the walk-in closet. Nathaniel's tailored suits hung perfectly arranged, his citrus-and-sandalwood cologne lingering in the air. My fingers trailed over one of his ties before I shook myself. This wasn't the time for melancholy.

The kitchen smelled of freshly brewed coffee—Alfred's doing. Our butler had left my favorite almond croissant warming in the oven. The small comfort almost made up for Nathaniel's absence. Almost.

My Uber pulled up to the Martin Group's sleek headquarters precisely at 9:45 AM. The glass skyscraper reflected the Manhattan skyline, a monument to the Martin family's empire. Security waved me through with practiced efficiency.

"Mrs. Martin." Samuel Yates, Nathaniel's perpetually harried assistant, intercepted me in the lobby. "Mr. Martin asked me to remind you about the charity gala tonight. He's... tied up with the Tokyo merger."

I forced a smile. "Of course." Translation: Another night alone. "Tell him I'll meet him there."

The elevator doors slid open to reveal Isabella Davis, resplendent in a dove-gray Chanel suit. Her honey-blonde hair cascaded over one shoulder, and her crimson lips curved into a smile that didn't reach her cold blue eyes.

"Evelyn." Her voice dripped with false warmth. "How... domestic you look today."

I glanced down at my tailored navy dress and sensible pumps. Compared to Isabella's runway-ready ensemble, I might as well have been wearing pajamas. "Isabella. I didn't realize Martin Group hired former reality stars as consultants."

Her manicured fingers tightened around her tablet. "Nathaniel values my... unique perspective." The emphasis made my stomach twist. "Oh, didn't he tell you? I'm spearheading the new luxury resorts division."

The elevator dinged at the 42nd floor. Isabella swept past me, her perfume—the same French brand Nathaniel had gifted me last Christmas—lingering like a taunt.

Gabrielle met me outside the conference room, her dark eyes wide with concern. "You okay? You look like you've seen a ghost."

"Just Isabella being Isabella." I squared my shoulders. "Let's get this over with."

The meeting dragged on for two grueling hours. By the time we finalized the resort's structural plans, my temples throbbed. I declined Gabrielle's lunch invitation, claiming a headache. The truth? I needed to see Nathaniel.

His office door stood slightly ajar. Through the gap, I saw him leaning against his desk, phone pressed to his ear. His usually impeccable tie hung loose, and his dark hair looked tousled, as if he'd been running his hands through it.

"—don't care what it takes, get it done before the board meeting." His voice held that dangerous edge I'd come to recognize—the one that meant billions hung in the balance. Then, softer: "Yes, I remember. Seven o'clock at our usual place."

The door creaked as I pushed it open. Nathaniel's head snapped up, his gray eyes widening almost imperceptibly before his professional mask slid back into place. He ended the call with a terse, "Handle it."

"Evelyn." He straightened his tie. "I didn't expect you."

"That much is obvious." I crossed my arms. "Our usual place? Should I be worried?"

A shadow crossed his face. "Business dinner. With the Tokyo investors."

"At seven? The gala starts at eight."

"I'll meet you there." He rounded the desk, his cologne enveloping me as he brushed a kiss against my cheek. "Trust me."

But as I watched him stride away, his phone already back at his ear, I couldn't shake the feeling that the man I married was slipping through my fingers like sand. And Isabella's smug smile haunted me all the way back to my office.

Evelyn's face turned ghostly pale as she stared rigidly at Nathaniel. Her voice was barely above a whisper when she asked, "Nathaniel, are you trying to push me away? I never imagined last night would become such a public scandal. If I had known it would end like this, I wouldn’t have let you leave."

Nathaniel remained silent, his expression unreadable, cold as winter frost.

Seeing him like this, Evelyn felt a crushing weight of despair, but there were words she could no longer speak. She could only do as he suggested, picking up the lunchbox she had brought with trembling hands before murmuring, "Nathaniel, please don’t be angry with me. I truly didn’t mean for this to happen. If you’re upset because picking me up last night made headlines, I’ll issue a statement immediately clarifying that we’re just friends. I’ll even send cease-and-desist letters to those tabloid reporters. Would that make you feel better?"

Nathaniel’s dark eyes bore into her, his face still an impassive mask. He hadn’t uttered a word, but his displeasure was palpable, impossible to ignore.

Evelyn bit her lip, frustration bubbling beneath the surface as her lengthy explanations were met with nothing but silence.

She pressed further, "Nathaniel, why won’t you speak? Are you telling me you don’t plan on divorcing, and that I should stay away from you from now on?"

"Evelyn, when did you become so insecure?" Nathaniel remarked coolly, his brow barely twitching.

His casual words struck her like a slap, leaving her momentarily speechless.

The implication was clear—without Isabella in the picture, she had been more confident, less prone to wild assumptions.

Evelyn wanted to argue, but fearing she’d only worsen his mood, she swallowed her words and left without another sound.

As she stepped out of the office, she nearly collided with Samuel Yates.

Her face was stiff, her eyes rimmed with unshed tears. "Mr. Yates, is Nathaniel upset about today’s trending news?"

Samuel, ever perceptive, noted the untouched lunchbox in her hands and the speed of her departure. Clearly, the visit hadn’t gone well, and the displeasure had been one-sided.

He lifted his chin slightly, his tone neutral. "Ms. Davis, I can’t speculate on Mr. Martin’s thoughts. If you have concerns, it’s best to address them with him directly."

Though irritation flickered in her chest, Evelyn didn’t lash out. She simply nodded and walked away.

Once she disappeared into the elevator, Samuel knocked and entered Nathaniel’s office.

He relayed Evelyn’s words verbatim. Nathaniel showed no reaction, his expression as unreadable as ever.

After a beat of silence, he finally spoke, his voice low. "Cancel tonight’s engagements. I’ll drive myself home."

Samuel blinked in surprise but quickly nodded. "Understood. I’ll arrange it immediately."

Nathaniel’s gaze darkened. "And the matter I asked you to look into—any updates?"

"Nothing significant yet. The usual faces come and go. Nothing suspicious beyond that."

"Keep watching. Don’t miss anyone they’ve been in contact with."

His eyes narrowed slightly, deep and unfathomable, like ancient secrets buried beneath layers of ice. The game had begun, and the players were stepping onto the stage one by one. A storm was brewing, and it wouldn’t be long before it broke.

Isabella had been working nonstop until mid-afternoon before finally returning to the office.

She had grabbed a quick lunch with Gabrielle earlier, but the lingering effects of her fever left her exhausted after minimal effort.

Gregory took one look at her pale face and poured her a glass of warm water. "Isabella, you should go home and rest."

"I can’t. I just discussed some design flaws with Mr. Carter. I need to make the revisions and show him tomorrow."

"Work will always be there. Lie down for a bit. I’ll wake you later, okay?"

Without waiting for a response, he took her laptop and gently guided her to the sofa.

Isabella didn’t protest. For the sake of her health—and the baby—she didn’t refuse.

She slept deeply, undisturbed even as the office quieted down near closing time. Gregory tiptoed in, careful not to wake her.

The fading sunlight cast a golden glow over her sleeping form. Her lashes fluttered slightly, her lips slightly parted, soft and inviting.

Gregory stood over her, his gaze darkening, his throat tightening.

He had loved her for years—first with the hope of being with her, then simply wishing for her happiness. But after she married Nathaniel, she had changed. The light in her eyes dimmed. It pained him. He wanted nothing more than for her to leave Nathaniel and cut all ties with the Martin family.

He knelt beside the sofa, his fingers hovering near her cheek, aching to touch but afraid she might wake. Just as his fingertips brushed her skin, he hesitated.

Unable to resist, he leaned in, intending to press a kiss to the corner of her lips. But before he could, a cold gust of air swept through the room, and a hand yanked him back by his collar.

"What do you think you’re doing?"

The voice was low, icy, restrained fury simmering beneath the surface. Nathaniel’s dark eyes burned with barely contained rage, his refined features stripped of all civility, leaving only ruthless intent.

Gregory smirked. "Isn’t it obvious? Do I need to spell it out for you?"

Before he could react, Nathaniel’s fist connected with his jaw—hard. The impact sent him stumbling back, giving him no chance to dodge.

Nathaniel dragged him out of the office and landed another brutal punch, his expression twisted with unchecked menace.

Gregory didn’t fight back. He hit the ground, Nathaniel towering over him, his gaze murderous. "Stay away from her. You know exactly who she is. If you try anything like this again, I won’t hesitate to make you disappear."

"The Martins have made people vanish before. I don’t doubt it," Gregory said, wiping blood from his lip. Despite his disheveled state, his mocking smile remained intact.

Nathaniel’s frown deepened, but he didn’t engage further. His warning was clear. "Don’t think because you’re her friend, I won’t act. Keep your filthy thoughts to yourself. I won’t have her exposed to your delusions."

"Mr. Martin, on what grounds do you say these things to me?" Gregory looked up, his smile unwavering. "As her husband? It seems, aside from that title, you and Isabella are less close than she and I. After all, the person she loves isn’t you. What does a piece of paper change?"
###Chapter 83

The morning sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Pineview Villa, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. Evelyn stood by the window, her fingers tracing the delicate veins of a monstera leaf as she watched Nathaniel's car disappear down the winding driveway. The silence of the grand house pressed against her ears.

Her phone buzzed with an incoming call from Gregory. "Evelyn, we've got a situation at the office," his voice carried an urgency she hadn't heard in weeks. "Summit Realty just pulled out of the waterfront project. Sebastian Wilson left a message saying they're taking their business elsewhere."

Evelyn's grip tightened around her phone. "What? We've spent months on those designs." Her mind raced through the implications - the team's hard work, the impending deadlines, the financial repercussions. "I'll be there in twenty minutes."

As she hurried to gather her things, Alfred appeared in the doorway, his usual composed demeanor slightly ruffled. "Madam, Mr. Martin just called. He asked that you meet him at the corporate office immediately. Something about reviewing contracts with Edward Martin."

Evelyn froze. Edward Martin's sudden interest in their business dealings never boded well. The old man's schemes were as intricate as the antique clocks he collected. "Tell him I'll be there after I handle the Summit crisis," she said, slipping into her blazer.

The drive to her architecture firm passed in a blur of honking horns and flashing traffic lights. When she arrived, the entire design team was gathered in the conference room, their faces drawn. Gabrielle handed her a tablet showing the termination email from Summit Realty. "They cited 'creative differences,'" her assistant said, making air quotes, "but Jonathan Blake told Daniel Carter it's because Isabella Davis recommended another firm."

Evelyn's blood ran cold. Isabella's name was like a ghost that refused to stay buried. "Get me everything we have on the contractual obligations," she instructed, her professional mask firmly in place despite the storm brewing beneath. "And someone pull Isabella's recent projects. I want to know exactly what we're up against."

As the team scrambled, Evelyn's phone lit up with a text from Nathaniel: "Grandfather's called an emergency board meeting. He's making moves. Be careful." The message was followed by three ominous dots indicating more was coming. Then: "Isabella will be there."

The office suddenly felt too small, the walls closing in. Evelyn realized with chilling clarity that this wasn't just about a lost client - it was the opening move in a much larger game. One where her marriage, her career, and everything she'd built were now pawns on Edward Martin's chessboard.

She took a steadying breath and straightened her shoulders. If they wanted a war, they'd get one. But this time, Evelyn Mitchell wouldn't play by their rules. She'd make her own.

Nathaniel's blunt accusation ignited fury within him once more.

His fist connected with Gregory's face—once, twice—until blood smeared his knuckles. The commotion drew the attention of employees lingering after work. Though they didn't understand the cause, they recognized Nathaniel immediately.

Gabrielle, Evelyn's assistant, rushed into her office. "Ms. Mitchell! There's a fight outside!"

Evelyn, drowsy from her nap, jolted awake. "Who?"

"Mr. Martin and Mr. Wilson."

She hurried out to find Gregory slumped on the floor, Nathaniel gripping his collar with icy disdain.

"Nathaniel! What are you doing?"

Evelyn shoved Nathaniel aside and helped Gregory up. "Gregory, are you hurt?"

"It's nothing," he muttered, wiping blood from his lip.

She turned on Nathaniel, eyes blazing. "Why would you attack him for no reason?"

"Ask him what he tried to do," Nathaniel bit out, his voice dangerously low.

Gregory interjected, "Evelyn, Mr. Martin misunderstood. It's fine. You two should go."

"Misunderstood?" Nathaniel scoffed. "You think attempting to kiss her while she slept is a misunderstanding? Pathetic. At least own your actions."

Evelyn didn't argue further. She arranged for Gregory's assistant to take him to the clinic and dismissed the remaining staff.

Alone with Nathaniel, she finally demanded, "Was this because you're jealous of my friendship with him?"

His jaw tightened. Before he could respond, she continued, "How is this fair? You parade around with Isabella, fueling rumors, while Gregory and I have never crossed any lines. So why?"

"So to you, I'm just some violent brute with no justification?" Nathaniel's laugh was brittle. The fight had left his hair disheveled, his shirt wrinkled, yet it only accentuated his dangerous allure.

Their gazes locked. Evelyn faltered.

Nathaniel pressed on, "If I'd been a second later, he would've kissed you. You call him a friend, but does he see you that way? What kind of 'friend' takes advantage when you're vulnerable? Do you truly believe men stay close without ulterior motives?"

Evelyn's breath hitched. The accusation swirled in her chest, leaving her speechless.

Finally, she whispered, "You're wrong. He wouldn’t. He knows my boundaries."

"So I imagined it?" Nathaniel's voice dropped. "Should I wait until he violates you to prove it? Evelyn, my line is clear: I won’t tolerate infidelity. Stay away from him—or I’ll enforce that distance myself."

She fell silent, unwilling to entertain his implications. To her, Gregory had always been just a friend. But doubt crept in—had there been other moments she’d missed?

The car ride to Pineview Villa was suffocating. Neither spoke. Even after parking, they remained seated, the tension thick.

Nathaniel broke the silence. "Have you ever considered finding the man you still love?"

Evelyn stiffened. "What?"

"If you haven't moved on... maybe I could help you locate him." Gregory's words haunted Nathaniel. Unless Evelyn resolved her feelings, that shadow would always linger between them.

Her lips pressed into a thin line. "No, thank you."

"Why not?"

"No reason. I’m not interested." She met his gaze. "Do you really want me to forget him?"

"It’s not about what I want. But my wife carrying another man in her heart? That’s unacceptable." His eyes darkened.

"And what about the woman in yours?" she countered. "Shouldn’t marriage be equal?"

Nathaniel’s expression hardened. "Things aren’t as they seem."

Evelyn mirrored his tone. "Perhaps neither are mine."

Their verbal dance left them both frustrated. Evelyn ached to confess that he was the one in her heart—but if his response was rejection, she’d rather keep it buried forever.

That night, she texted Gregory:
[Are you okay?]

He replied instantly:
[Just a scratch. Did he take it out on you?]

She typed:
[I’m sorry. He misinterpreted things. This shouldn’t have happened.]

Gregory called immediately. "Why are you apologizing? He’s the one who threw punches. I don’t need his remorse—or yours."

Evelyn’s voice was steady. "Gregory, I’m his wife."

The word wife silenced him.

"Right," he said coldly. "I overstepped. Forget it."

She hung up, turmoil churning. Unless she acted, this would happen again. And Evelyn refused to let anyone else get hurt because of her.

###Chapter 84

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, blinking against the light as she turned to find Nathaniel already awake, his piercing gaze fixed on her.

"You're up early," she murmured, her voice still thick with sleep.

Nathaniel's lips curved into a lazy smile. "Couldn't sleep. Too much on my mind."

Evelyn propped herself up on one elbow, studying him. "Anything you want to talk about?"

He exhaled, running a hand through his tousled hair. "Just work. The merger with Summit Realty is getting complicated. Sebastian Wilson is playing hardball."

Evelyn frowned. "I thought the terms were already agreed upon?"

"They were," Nathaniel said darkly. "Until he decided to change them last minute."

She reached out, brushing her fingers over his tense knuckles. "You'll handle it. You always do."

His expression softened at her touch, but before he could respond, his phone buzzed on the nightstand. Samuel Yates’ name flashed across the screen.

Nathaniel sighed, grabbing it. "Yates. What now?"

Evelyn watched as his jaw tightened, the muscles in his shoulders coiling like a spring. Something was wrong.

"Understood. I'll be there in twenty." He ended the call and stood abruptly.

"What happened?" Evelyn asked, sitting up fully now.

"Edward Martin just had a heart attack."

Her breath caught. "Is he—?"

"He's stable. But I need to go."

Evelyn scrambled out of bed. "I'm coming with you."

Nathaniel hesitated, then nodded. "Alright. But hurry."

As they dressed in tense silence, Evelyn’s mind raced. Edward Martin wasn’t just Nathaniel’s grandfather—he was the backbone of the Martin empire. If anything happened to him…

She pushed the thought away. Now wasn’t the time for speculation.

The drive to the hospital was a blur of city streets and honking horns. When they arrived, the private wing was already swarming with family—Victoria Martin’s tear-streaked face, Richard Martin’s grim expression, and Winston, Edward’s loyal butler, standing stiffly by the door.

Dr. Harrison emerged from the room, his face unreadable. "He’s asking for Nathaniel."

Nathaniel didn’t hesitate. He strode forward, but Evelyn caught his wrist.

"Whatever happens in there," she whispered, "I’m with you."

His grip tightened briefly before he let go and disappeared behind the door.

Evelyn turned to the others, forcing calm into her voice. "He’ll be alright. He’s strong."

Victoria let out a shaky breath. "He has to be."

But as Evelyn stood there, surrounded by the Martin family’s silent dread, she couldn’t shake the feeling that this was more than just a health scare.

Something was coming.

And it would change everything.

The call ended, leaving Evelyn in prolonged silence. Only when Nathaniel retreated to their bedroom did she finally regain her composure.

Meanwhile at the hospital, Gregory emerged clutching medication, his expression unreadable beneath the cold aura surrounding him.

"Mr. Wilson, shall I drive you home now?" his assistant inquired as Gregory slid into the backseat.

A curt nod.

Gregory leaned back, eyes closed, the remainder of the journey passing in heavy silence. Upon arriving at his penthouse, he tossed the untouched medication aside and headed straight for the shower.

Evelyn's words about establishing boundaries echoed relentlessly. Pretending they didn't affect him was impossible.

He'd always admired Evelyn's razor-sharp clarity about what she wanted - and didn't want. That very quality had drawn him to her years ago.

Even if she erected walls between them, his feelings wouldn't change.

Otherwise, he wouldn't have waited this long.

A bitter chuckle escaped his lips. "Evelyn Mitchell, you're truly merciless," he murmured to the steamy bathroom tiles.

Stepping out wrapped in a towel, Gregory froze. A woman lounged on his sofa, scrolling through her phone.

His jaw tightened. "What are you doing here? I explicitly said no contact during this critical phase. Do you realize how close he is to discovering everything?"

Danielle looked up, unfazed. "I took three different cabs and circled the block twice. No one followed me."

Gregory's shoulders relaxed marginally. "You can't take these risks. One slip and everything we've worked for collapses. Understood?"

"Perfectly." She rose, fingertips brushing the bruise on his cheekbone. "How did this happen?"

"Nothing important."

Her eyes flashed. "Don't I deserve your trust?"

"A minor disagreement with Nathaniel."

Danielle's breath hitched. "Over what?" Before he could answer, she hissed, "It's Evelyn, isn't it?"

"This doesn't concern her."

"Everything concerns her lately! What else could make you two fight? I don't get your obsession. She's jeopardizing our entire—"

"Enough." Gregory's voice turned glacial. "I've made my position clear. Evelyn remains separate from our objectives. If you can't respect that, perhaps we should reconsider our arrangement."

The unyielding steel in his gaze made Danielle recoil. "Fine. I'll follow your lead."

"Good. Now leave - and don't return unless it's urgent."

After ensuring Danielle entered the elevator, Gregory double-locked his door. Still uneasy, he fired off a text:

[Remember - no more visits. I'll contact you when it's safe.]

Her reply came instantly: [Understood.] Only then did he exhale.

Perhaps provoked by Gregory's actions, Nathaniel began personally collecting Evelyn from work daily. When business detained him, Samuel or a chauffeur would appear instead.

Initially resistant, Evelyn protested, "This surveillance is unnecessary."

Nathaniel's fingers tightened on the steering wheel. "I won't risk anything threatening our marriage again."

The finality in his tone brooked no argument.

Gregory recognized the unspoken message in Nathaniel's new routine. Noting Evelyn's passive acceptance, he confronted her during lunch. "Is Mr. Martin marking his territory? Preventing some imagined transgression between us?"

Evelyn stirred her latte. "He's just... suddenly developed free time."

Weeks of her growing distance finally pushed Gregory to ask, "If he's forbidding our friendship, just say so. I'll step back to spare you trouble."

"You're misreading things."

"Then why the coldness?" Gregory leaned forward. "Evelyn, I know you. Did Nathaniel threaten you?"

Her spoon clinked against the porcelain. "Gregory, I'm a grown woman capable of setting boundaries. Our closeness was becoming... inappropriate. For both our sakes, especially future relationships, distance is wise."

A humorless smile twisted his lips. "Planning to play matchmaker now?"

Evelyn's expression sobered. "I said 'if.' Unless you plan to die alone?"

Gregory's eyes narrowed. "Have I made you uncomfortable?"

"Not at all." She forced a smile. "Friends don't pressure each other, right?"

That word - friends - landed like a guillotine between them.

Her ringing phone shattered the tension.

Nathaniel's baritone vibrated through the receiver: "I'm outside your office."

Evelyn's gaze flicked to Gregory. "I'll be right down."

Five minutes later, Nathaniel watched Evelyn exit the building, her silhouette backlit by sunset. From his eighteenth-floor window, Gregory observed her approach the waiting Bentley.

He imagined her smiling as Nathaniel opened the car door. The thought burned like acid.

"Early today," Evelyn remarked, buckling her seatbelt. "Playing hooky from the office?"

Nathaniel's hand covered hers. "Some things are more important than meetings."

As the car pulled away, Evelyn resisted glancing back at the building. Some goodbyes were better left unacknowledged.
###Chapter 85

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

She sighed, sitting up and running a hand through her tousled hair. The weight of their recent argument still lingered, pressing against her chest like an invisible hand.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory.

"Evelyn, we need to finalize the blueprints for the Summit project by noon. Edward is breathing down my neck."

She groaned. The Summit Realty deal was supposed to be her big break, but lately, it felt like a noose tightening around her.

Throwing back the covers, she padded to the bathroom, splashing cold water on her face. The reflection staring back at her looked exhausted—dark circles under her eyes, lips pressed into a thin line.

When was the last time I slept properly?

Breakfast was a rushed affair—black coffee and a half-eaten piece of toast. She grabbed her bag and keys, pausing only to glance at the framed photo on the hallway table. Their wedding day. Nathaniel’s arms around her, both of them laughing like they didn’t have a care in the world.

Now, it felt like they were strangers sharing the same house.

The drive to the office was a blur of traffic and honking horns. By the time she arrived, her nerves were frayed.

Gabrielle, her assistant, intercepted her the moment she stepped inside.

"Mr. Wilson has been asking for you. And—" she hesitated, lowering her voice, "Isabella Davis called. Twice."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. Isabella. Nathaniel’s ex. The woman who had slithered back into their lives like a ghost from the past.

What does she want now?

Before she could respond, Gregory appeared in the doorway, his expression grim.

"We have a problem."

She followed him into the conference room, where Jonathan Blake from Summit Realty stood waiting, arms crossed.

"The client wants major revisions," Jonathan said without preamble. "And they want them by the end of the week."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. "That’s impossible. We’ve already gone through three rounds of changes."

Jonathan’s smile was tight. "Not my call. Sebastian’s orders."

Sebastian Wilson. The man who seemed determined to make her life a living hell.

As she sank into a chair, her phone buzzed again. A text from Nathaniel.

"We need to talk."

Her fingers trembled as she typed a reply. "About what?"

The three dots appeared, then disappeared. Then—

"Isabella."

The room spun.

She barely registered Gregory’s voice as he continued discussing the revisions. All she could think about was Nathaniel’s message.

What did Isabella tell him?

And more importantly—

Was this the end of them?

"Mrs. Martin, I'm the boss."

Evelyn blinked. Right, the boss. The man who calls all the shots.

Out of nowhere, he suggested, "Let's go out for dinner. What are you craving?"

"Why eat out?" she questioned.

"Tired of home-cooked meals," Nathaniel replied casually, making the chefs at Pineview Villa sneeze in unison, as if sensing the betrayal.

They ended up at a high-end restaurant. Lately, Evelyn had developed an obsession with spicy sour soup.

The moment it arrived, she downed an entire bowl, barely touching anything else.

Nathaniel frowned. "Is it really that good?"

"Try it. Tangy, spicy—absolutely addictive."

Just as she lifted the spoon to her lips, Nathaniel caught her wrist, redirecting it toward his own mouth. He drank straight from her spoon.

Evelyn stared, baffled. Nathaniel, however, remained unbothered, smirking as he said, "Hmm. Sour... but sweet."

Sweet?

Since when is sour soup sweet?

Is he hallucinating?

Then it hit her—what he really meant by "sweet." Her cheeks flamed instantly. The warmth of his touch lingered on her wrist, sending her pulse into overdrive. Even after everything, moments like this still left her breathless.

Noticing her hesitation, Nathaniel’s voice dropped low. "Why’d you stop eating?"

"I'm... full," she murmured.

"So soon? You said it was delicious." His smirk deepened. "Evelyn, are you blushing?"

She scowled, avoiding his gaze. "Of course not."

Nathaniel nodded sagely. "Right. I’m the shy one here."

She pressed her lips together. Experience had taught her that when she couldn’t outwit him, silence was the best defense.

After dinner, they returned to Pineview Villa. It was past eight.

Evelyn headed for a shower while Nathaniel lounged on the leather sofa, flipping through a book.

Then her phone rang.

She answered in front of him. "Hello?"

"Guess who this is?"

A smooth, husky male voice filled the quiet room.

Evelyn’s gaze flicked to Nathaniel. Their eyes met briefly before she looked away, smiling into the phone. "No need to guess. I know it’s you."

"Recognized me that fast?"

"Your voice is unforgettable. What’s the occasion?"

She stepped onto the balcony, escaping Nathaniel’s piercing stare. The night air was a relief.

The caller chuckled. "Missed you. Thought I’d drop by."

"You? The hermit, leaving your cave just to see me? Now I know you’re joking."

"Dead serious. I’ll be in Mayby tomorrow night. Pick me up?"

His voice, warm and effortless, sent a thrill through her.

Evelyn grinned. "Of course. What time?"

After settling the details, she added, "Need me to book you a place? Or do you have it covered?"

"Here for a friend’s favor. Staying a few days. I’ll handle lodging—just want to see you. It’s been over a year, hasn’t it?"

"Fine, Mr. Mysterious. But wrap up—I don’t want a mob chasing you."

"You still don’t know me well enough? Teasing me now?"

"Wouldn’t dare. You’re every girl’s dream prince, after all."

Their banter left her spirits high.

Hanging up, she stretched her arms wide—only to freeze when she turned and found Nathaniel right behind her, watching.

Her eyes widened. "How long have you been there?"

"Since you stepped out."

His tone was calm, but his gaze was anything but.

Evelyn frowned. "Were you eavesdropping?"

"I was standing in plain sight. You were too absorbed to notice. So—who has you that happy?"

His stare was relentless, dissecting her every reaction.

"Just a friend. Not like I was hiding it. You just startled me," she said lightly.

"Just a friend?"

"Yes."

She wondered why he’d been so on edge lately, reading into everything.

"A friend makes you that happy?"

Nathaniel’s smile was razor-sharp.

"We haven’t seen each other in ages. Of course I’m happy."

"If it’s worth celebrating, share it with me."

Evelyn’s frown deepened. "Nathaniel, I told you—it’s just catching up with an old friend. Nothing for you to be happy about, so drop it, okay?"

She wasn’t sure how to explain when there was nothing to explain.

Nathaniel’s gaze hardened. "Or is it that you won’t share?"

"I’m not hiding anything. It’s late—I don’t want to argue. I just want to sleep."

She moved to leave, but he caught her wrist, pinning her against the wall.

His voice was dangerously soft. "Running so soon? Guilty conscience?"

"No."

"Then what? Why shut me out?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "A friend’s visiting Mayby soon. We’re meeting for dinner. We’re close, so yes, I’m happy. Happy now?"

His grip tightened. "Not even close."

Then his mouth crashed onto hers.
###Chapter 86

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting golden streaks across our bedroom. I stirred awake to find Nathaniel already dressed, his crisp white shirt accentuating his broad shoulders. He turned, catching my gaze, and flashed that heart-stopping smile that still made my pulse race after all this time.

"Morning, Evelyn," he murmured, leaning down to brush his lips against my forehead. "Sleep well?"

"Better now that you're here," I teased, stretching beneath the satin sheets. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted from the kitchen where Alfred must have prepared breakfast.

Nathaniel's phone buzzed insistently. He glanced at the screen, his expression tightening almost imperceptibly. "Samuel needs me at the office early. There's... something that needs my attention."

I sat up, instantly alert. "Everything alright?"

"Just routine Martin Group business," he said too quickly, adjusting his cufflinks. But I knew my husband - the slight tension in his jaw betrayed his words. Before I could press further, he kissed me again. "Don't worry. I'll see you at the gala tonight."

As the front door closed behind him, I reached for my own phone. Three missed calls from Gregory. My stomach dropped. He never called this early unless—

"Evelyn, thank God," Gregory's voice crackled through the line. "We have a situation. Summit Realty just pulled out of the waterfront project. Sebastian Wilson left a message saying they're taking their designs elsewhere."

The news hit like a physical blow. That project was our firm's biggest commission this year. "What reason did he give?"

"None. Just that it was a 'business decision.'" Gregory's tone darkened. "But get this - Isabella Davis was spotted having lunch with Jonathan Blake yesterday at The Oak Room."

Ice flooded my veins. Isabella. Nathaniel's ex who'd made no secret of wanting him back. And Jonathan was Summit's project manager. This couldn't be coincidence.

I was halfway through dressing when Caroline called. "You need to see this," she said without preamble. A second later, my screen lit up with a gossip column photo: Isabella draped over Nathaniel at some charity event last night, her manicured fingers possessively gripping his arm.

The caption burned my eyes: "Reconciliation in the air for Martin heir and former flame?"

My hands trembled as I scrolled to the next image - Nathaniel's expression unreadable as Isabella whispered something in his ear. He hadn't mentioned seeing her last night. Hadn't mentioned anything.

The bedroom door burst open. Gabrielle stood there, face pale. "Evelyn, you need to come to the office. Now. Someone just leaked confidential blueprints to the press - our entire Lakeside development is front-page news."

As I grabbed my bag, my phone buzzed again. Unknown number. The attached photo made my blood run cold: Nathaniel entering a hotel room, the timestamp from two hours ago. The next image showed Isabella stepping into the same room fifteen minutes later.

The final text read: "Some marriages are built on lies. Tonight, everyone will know yours is one of them."

She barely had time to complete her thought before his lips captured hers.

The space between them vanished in an instant, his mouth claiming hers with possessive urgency. After days of hectic schedules and stolen moments, Nathaniel found himself losing control, his teeth grazing her lower lip in a barely restrained bite.

Evelyn gasped against his mouth, hands instinctively pushing at his chest, but Nathaniel anticipated her resistance. He caught her wrists effortlessly, pinning them above her head against the wall, leaving her no room for protest.

Time dissolved as the kiss deepened. Evelyn's knees weakened, her body melting against his until only Nathaniel's firm grip kept her upright. When he finally pulled back, his breathing was ragged, his darkened gaze tracing the swollen curve of her lips.

"You destroy me, Evelyn," Nathaniel murmured, his voice rough with barely leashed desire.

Eyes wide with innocent confusion, Evelyn thought, I didn't even do anything!

Reading her expression, Nathaniel dragged his thumb across her damp lower lip. "Don't look at me like that, sweetheart."

The implication in his gravelly tone finally registered. Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks as she squirmed in his hold. "Nathaniel, let go. I can't breathe."

His smirk turned wolfish. "Now you're just inventing excuses."

Evelyn pressed her lips into a stubborn line.

With surprising tenderness, he smoothed back her hair. "Just let me hold you. I'll behave." His arms encircled her waist, pulling her flush against him as satisfaction curved his mouth.

Long minutes passed before Nathaniel spoke again, his voice still thick. "Your friend arrives in Mayby tomorrow. As hosts, we should take him to dinner. Any dietary restrictions? I'll have Samuel reserve the private dining room at The Sapphire."

Evelyn shook her head. "That's unnecessary. He's quite shy—I planned to pick him up and dine alone. His accommodations are already arranged, and this is primarily a business trip. I don't want to overwhelm him."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "You're ashamed to introduce me to your friends?"

"What? No!"

"Then why the secrecy? Is it because he's male? Or do you deliberately keep me separate from your life?" His tone brooked no argument, the unspoken demand clear—he would meet this friend.

Evelyn frowned. Since when did Nathaniel care about such formalities? Is he worried I'll embarrass him?

With a resigned sigh, she relented. "If you insist, I'll ask him first. If he agrees, we can all dine together. Satisfied?"

Nathaniel neither confirmed nor denied, leaving the decision hanging between them like an unspoken challenge.

Evelyn massaged her temples. What's gotten into him lately?

She pushed the thought aside. Their marriage had an expiration date—analyzing his every mood swing was pointless. Still, she noted with surprise that since Isabella's scandal broke, Nathaniel had shown zero interest in his ex. No calls came during their shared rides home, though texts remained a mystery.

(Isabella had, in fact, messaged repeatedly. Nathaniel left every notification unread. Not wanting to provoke his ire further, Isabella channeled her frustration into her secret Twitter account.)

Her latest post, thirty minutes prior, read:
[We belong together, but his family forced him into a marriage of convenience with her. When he finally sought divorce, she manipulated the elders to trap him. I refuse to be the other woman, yet walking away destroys me. A loveless union can't last—but must I be the one to surrender?]

Though posted anonymously, her devoted followers recognized her voice. Within minutes, thousands rallied behind "the wronged heroine," vilifying the unnamed schemer.

[Queen, we know it's you! Name the witch!]
[True love deserves fighting for!]
[We stand with you!]

The outpouring soothed Isabella's wounded pride—until reality intruded. No word from Isaac. No response from Nathaniel.

Having subtly hinted to industry contacts about her "upcoming collaboration with Isaac," failure now meant public humiliation. After a sleepless night, she devised a new approach.

The next morning found her parked outside Martin Group headquarters. Unlike previous visits, she remained in her car and dialed Nathaniel's private line.

"Nathaniel, forgive the interruption. Are you free?"

"Preparing for a board meeting. What do you need?"

"I'm downstairs. It's about... I think I remembered something last night regarding that matter..."

"Why wait until now?" His sharp tone betrayed unusual urgency.

Isabella bit her lip. "I feared you'd still be angry. Nathaniel, please—I know I was wrong. Don't shut me out?"

Her nails dug into her palms as silence stretched. Finally:

"Come up."

"But your meeting—"

"I'll send Samuel. Now."

Though his words were calm, Nathaniel's expression turned glacial as he ended the call. By the time Samuel announced Isabella's arrival, his mask of polite indifference was flawless.

"Ms. Davis," Nathaniel gestured to the sitting area, pouring her mineral water with practiced courtesy. "You usually don't hesitate to visit. Why the hesitation today?"

Isabella accepted the glass with trembling fingers. "I didn't want to be a distraction."

Nathaniel studied her over the rim of his coffee cup. "Still upset about the disciplinary measures?"

###Chapter 87

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, blinking against the light. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She traced the curve of his jaw with her fingertips, a small smile playing on her lips.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory.

"Emergency meeting at the office. We need you here ASAP."

Evelyn sighed. She had hoped for a quiet morning, but work never waited. Carefully, she slipped out of bed, trying not to disturb Nathaniel.

Downstairs, Alfred had already prepared breakfast—fresh fruit, toast, and coffee. He gave her a knowing look. "Another early start, Miss Evelyn?"

She nodded, grabbing a piece of toast. "Duty calls."

The drive to the office was quick. The city was just waking up, the streets still quiet. When she arrived, Gregory was pacing in the conference room, his expression tense.

"You're not going to believe this," he said, handing her a folder.

Evelyn flipped it open. Inside were blueprints—her blueprints—but with significant alterations. The signature at the bottom made her blood run cold.

Sebastian Wilson.

Her grip tightened on the papers. "What is this?"

Gregory exhaled sharply. "Summit Realty just submitted these to the city council. They’re claiming it’s their original design."

Evelyn’s mind raced. This was sabotage. She had spent months perfecting those plans, and now Sebastian was trying to steal her work.

She reached for her phone, dialing Nathaniel. He answered on the second ring, his voice rough with sleep.

"Evelyn? Everything okay?"

"No," she said, her voice steady despite the anger simmering beneath. "I need your help."

There was a pause, then the sound of sheets rustling. "I’m on my way."

Evelyn ended the call, her gaze fixed on the blueprints. This wasn’t just about a project anymore.


"I didn't, Nathaniel. How could I blame you? That incident was my fault from the beginning. I shouldn't have let Vanessa arrange for you to pick me up. I know how strictly you separate your personal and professional life. It was my mistake..."

"Enough. That's in the past. Let's not revisit it," Nathaniel cut her off, his expression unreadable.

Isabella nodded, offering a gentle smile. "Nathaniel, please don't be upset. I promise it won’t happen again."

"Hmm." He acknowledged with a slight nod before shifting the topic. "What exactly did you remember last night?"

Isabella met his gaze steadily. "I recalled that the man had a tattoo—a dragon coiling around his entire arm."

"Why would such a specific detail surface now?"

"Perhaps seeing a documentary about tattoos triggered the memory."

Nathaniel studied her in silence, his piercing gaze making her shift uncomfortably.

"Nathaniel, why are you looking at me like that? Do you doubt me?"

"Not at all. I'm just trying to recall if I’ve encountered someone matching that description."

"Have you?" she pressed softly.

"Not certain yet." He glanced away, then added, "Isabella, I consulted specialists about your condition. Trauma can sometimes suppress memories temporarily. A psychologist might help retrieve them. Can you spare time in the coming days for a session?"

A flicker of tension crossed Isabella’s ever-serene face before she nodded. "Of course. I’ll follow your lead, Nathaniel."

He hummed in response, falling silent.

Sipping the water he’d poured, Isabella ventured, "Any word from Isaac? The silence is unsettling. Has he refused?"

"Samuel is handling it," Nathaniel said, striding to his desk and dialing an extension. "Any updates on Isaac?"

Samuel’s voice came through promptly. "Mr. Martin, I just received confirmation. Isaac is in Mayby. I’ve arranged dinner tomorrow at The Scarlet."

"Good. His accommodations?"

"He declined to share, and I didn’t press to avoid discomfort."

"Manage it discreetly."

Hanging up, Nathaniel turned to find Isabella approaching, her eyes alight. "Isaac is here?"

"Yes."

"Nathaniel, you’re incredible! I never imagined he’d agree to meet."

Isaac wasn’t just a legendary composer—his last single had shattered records within minutes. Association with him meant industry reverence and limitless opportunities.

The thought sent a thrill through Isabella. She impulsively clasped Nathaniel’s arm.

He frowned, subtly withdrawing. The gesture reminded him of Evelyn’s unfiltered joy upon receiving a friend’s call—genuine, unlike Isabella’s calculated enthusiasm.

"Meeting doesn’t guarantee cooperation," he said coolly. "We’ll know tomorrow."

Undeterred, Isabella nodded. "I understand. But I believe he’ll say yes."

She lingered until Samuel announced a meeting, then excused herself, buoyant. Once Isaac writes for me, let’s see Evelyn compete with that.

By midday, Evelyn texted Nathaniel:
[No need to pick me up later. I’ll cab home early.]

Receiving no reply, she assumed he was busy and left the office.

As she hailed a cab, a sleek black car pulled up. The window lowered, revealing Nathaniel.

"You’re here? Didn’t you get my text? It’s too early—I can manage."

"We can’t idle here. Get in."

She canceled the cab, buckling up as the car merged into traffic.

"I wasn’t here for you," he said tersely. "Had business nearby."

A hint of jealousy laced his tone.

Evelyn suppressed a smile. "Nathaniel, I’m a CEO too. My company might not rival Martin Group, but I set my hours."

"Noted, Ms. Mitchell," he deadpanned, his deep voice sending warmth to her cheeks. She turned to the window, hiding her blush.

Back at Pineview Villa, Evelyn showered and sat at her vanity, reaching for her makeup.

Pregnancy had kept her bare-faced lately, something Nathaniel openly preferred. So when he saw her lining her eyes, he frowned. "What are you doing?"

"Eyeliner," she said, steady-handed.

"For an airport reunion? Is that necessary?"

"It’s basic courtesy. I can’t greet a friend looking disheveled."

"You claimed closeness. Why the formality?"

"Nathaniel, it’s just light makeup. Why twist it?"

Exasperated, she finished her subtle look—peach lipstick, a flowy dress, and a trench coat—effortlessly striking.

Satisfied, she grabbed her bag. "I’m heading out now?"

Silence.

She turned to leave when his voice stopped her. "Wait. Come here."

Approaching, she gasped as he pulled her into a searing kiss, leaving her breathless.

###Chapter 88

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, blinking against the soft light as she turned to find Nathaniel already awake, his piercing gaze fixed on her.

"You're up early," she murmured, stretching slightly.

Nathaniel smirked, his fingers tracing idle patterns along her arm. "Couldn't sleep. Too much on my mind."

Evelyn propped herself up on one elbow, studying him. "Anything you want to talk about?"

Before he could answer, his phone buzzed on the nightstand. He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening. "It's Samuel."

Evelyn exhaled. "Work?"

Nathaniel nodded, sitting up. "I need to take this."

She watched as he strode out of the room, his voice low and clipped. Something was off.

Downstairs, Alfred was setting the breakfast table. He gave her a polite nod. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin."

"Morning, Alfred," she replied absently, her thoughts still on Nathaniel's tension.

The front door opened, and footsteps echoed in the hall. A moment later, Gregory Wilson appeared, looking harried. "Evelyn, we have a problem."

She frowned. "What kind of problem?"

"The Summit Realty deal. Sebastian Wilson just pulled out."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. "What? Why?"

Gregory ran a hand through his hair. "No explanation. Just a cold email saying they're terminating negotiations."

Nathaniel re-entered the room, his jaw tight. "I just got off the phone with Jonathan Blake. He claims it's a 'strategic realignment.'"

Evelyn crossed her arms. "That's corporate speak for someone got to them."

Nathaniel's eyes flashed. "Exactly."

A tense silence settled over them. Then, Evelyn squared her shoulders. "We need to find out who's behind this."

Nathaniel's phone buzzed again. He glanced at it, then looked up, his expression unreadable. "We might already know."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "Who?"

His voice was grim. "Isabella Davis."

The name hung in the air like a storm cloud. Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Of course it is."

Gregory frowned. "But why would she interfere with your business?"

Nathaniel's grip on his phone tightened. "Because she knows hitting us professionally is the fastest way to get under our skin."

Evelyn met his gaze, determination hardening her features. "Then we hit back."

Nathaniel's lips curved into a dangerous smile. "Oh, we will."

The game had just escalated. And Evelyn wasn't about to let Isabella win.

Nathaniel's palm cradled the back of Evelyn's head, his grip firm yet possessive. She wanted to pull away, but his other arm was locked around her waist, trapping her against him. Afraid of putting pressure on her abdomen, she could only tilt her head and surrender to his demanding kiss.

His lips claimed hers with an intensity that left no room for escape. The scent of him—warm, masculine, intoxicating—filled her senses. He deepened the kiss, his mouth moving over hers with relentless hunger, teasing and tasting until she was breathless.

By the time he finally pulled back, Evelyn was limp against his chest, her face flushed, her pulse racing. She looked up at him, her voice a breathless murmur. "What was that for?"

It sounded more like a coy challenge than a protest.

Nathaniel's lips curved as he leaned down to steal another quick kiss. "What do you think?" His voice was rough, thick with desire. Even through the fabric of her dress, she could feel the heat of his hands branding her skin.

Evelyn bit her lip, unaware of how tempting she looked in that moment.

"Skip your plans tonight," he murmured, his fingers tracing the curve of her jaw.

"No."

She tried to shift away, but he tightened his hold, keeping her in place.

Nathaniel brushed his thumb over her lips. "No more lipstick. It doesn't taste good."

The blunt demand made her cheeks burn hotter.

At first, he had only meant to wipe away the bright color, but the sight of her bare lips—soft, slightly swollen—only made his restraint falter further. His gaze darkened, and Evelyn knew if this continued, she wouldn’t be leaving the house at all.

Seizing the moment when his grip loosened slightly, she slipped free and hurried toward the door, her heart pounding.

Nathaniel watched her go, a slow smirk curving his lips.

At the airport, Evelyn spotted her friend waiting at the arrivals gate. The man wore a cap pulled low over his forehead, sunglasses, and a nondescript outfit—clearly trying to avoid attention. They exchanged a quick embrace.

"Long time no see," she teased. "I was worried I’d hug the wrong person. That would’ve been awkward."

He chuckled. "Still as sharp-tongued as ever?"

They walked to the parking lot together, and as Evelyn slid into the driver’s seat, she said, "Let’s grab dinner first, then you can rest. Tomorrow, I’ll show you around the city."

"Sounds perfect. Though, I have a dinner tomorrow night—care to join me?"

"Isn’t that inappropriate?"

"Since when are you so formal with me?" He smirked. "I’d feel better with you there. Otherwise, I might just bail."

It was half a joke, but not entirely untrue. He had always been socially anxious, preferring small gatherings over crowded events. Tomorrow’s dinner was an exception, and Evelyn understood.

She agreed.

At the restaurant, they settled into a private booth. As they ate, her friend suddenly asked, "You’ve been distant this past year, Evelyn. Not that I mind, but… are you okay?"

"I’m fine," she said, shaking her head. "Just personal things."

"Good." He didn’t press further. Then, after a pause, he added, "Is Gregory still in Mayby with you?"

"Yes. We’re partners at the firm now."

"He’s always treated you well." His tone turned knowing. "And as a man, I can tell—he’s in love with you."

Evelyn laughed. "Oh, come on. Let’s not ruin a good friendship with that kind of talk."

"If he had any game, you’d have fallen for him years ago."

She only smiled, not denying it.

Her friend didn’t push. After dinner, she dropped him off at his hotel. Before getting out, he said, "I talked too much tonight. If I annoyed you, just say so. Though I can’t promise I’ll change next time."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "If only your social anxiety could cure your big mouth."

He mimed zipping his lips and walked inside.

Meanwhile, at Pineview Villa, Nathaniel’s phone rang.

A voice reported, "Mr. Martin, Mrs. Martin just dropped her friend at the hotel. She didn’t go inside—they said goodbye at the entrance."

"Good."

He hung up, setting the phone aside.

Evelyn had no idea.

When she returned home half an hour later, she headed straight upstairs. Nathaniel was in bed, reading, ignoring her.

She broke the silence first. "Not sleeping yet?"

"My wife is out with another man. How could I sleep?"

"I told you I was going. It’s not like I snuck out."

"Only because I asked. Would you have told me otherwise?"

His sharp gaze pinned her.

Evelyn had no answer.

She showered, removed her makeup, and waited—but the moment she slipped into bed, Nathaniel rolled over, pressing her into the mattress.

Instinctively, her hands flew to her stomach, stopping him from putting his full weight on her.

He frowned. "What’s wrong?"

"You’re too heavy. It hurts."

Nathaniel accepted the excuse but adjusted, lifting her on top of him instead. His fingers tipped her chin up. "I’ve waited all night. Now it’s your turn to satisfy me."

She opened her mouth to protest, but he silenced her with another kiss.

Evelyn knew she couldn’t keep refusing. If she did, he’d figure it out sooner or later. Caroline had assured her that as long as they were careful, it would be fine. So she controlled the pace, driving Nathaniel to the edge of madness.

By the time they finished, it was deep into the night. Nathaniel, thoroughly satisfied, cleaned her up with a smug tenderness that only made her more flustered. She threw a pillow at him before burying her face in the sheets.

The next morning, Evelyn slept through her alarm.

Nathaniel turned it off for her, letting her rest. But just as he was about to leave, her phone rang.

He picked it up, saw the name, and answered immediately, stepping onto the balcony.

"Evelyn, I brought breakfast. Want to share it at the office?" Gregory’s voice came through.

Nathaniel’s tone was deceptively smooth. "Mr. Wilson, how thoughtful of you. But my wife is still asleep. She won’t be joining you today. Enjoy your meal alone."

The words were laced with warning.

Gregory stiffened. "Mr. Martin, are you now dictating who Evelyn can see?"
###Chapter 89

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of our penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. I stretched beneath the silk sheets, my fingers brushing against the empty space where Nathaniel should have been. The digital clock on the nightstand blinked 7:32 AM in bold red numbers.

"Alfred?" I called out, my voice still thick with sleep.

The door opened immediately, revealing our ever-efficient butler. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin. Mr. Martin left for the office two hours ago. He asked me to inform you that the board meeting was moved up unexpectedly."

I sighed, running a hand through my tangled hair. "Of course it was." These sudden schedule changes had become more frequent since Edward Martin's health began declining. The weight of the Martin Group was shifting onto Nathaniel's shoulders faster than either of us had anticipated.

The scent of freshly brewed coffee and cinnamon rolls drifted through the open door. "Rosalind prepared your favorite breakfast," Alfred added with a knowing smile. "She mentioned something about needing your strength today."

As I stepped into the shower, the hot water did little to ease the tension coiling in my shoulders. Today marked the final review of the Harborview project - my first major design since joining Martin Group. The memory of Isabella Davis's smug expression at last week's presentation flashed through my mind. Her architectural firm had been the primary competitor for this contract.

My phone buzzed against the bathroom counter. A text from Gregory lit up the screen: "Emergency meeting at 9. Summit Realty changed their requirements again. Bring your A-game."

I groaned, turning off the water with more force than necessary. Summit Realty and their mercurial CEO Sebastian Wilson had been nothing but trouble since day one. Every approved design seemed to spark a dozen new "suggestions" from their team.

The walk-in closet offered too many choices. I settled on a navy Carolina Herrera pantsuit - professional but with enough feminine detailing to remind the boardroom that I wasn't just Nathaniel's wife. The diamond studs Nathaniel had given me for our anniversary caught the light as I fastened them, their cool weight a comforting reminder of his support.

Downstairs, Rosalind had indeed outdone herself. The cinnamon rolls were still warm, their icing melting slightly against my fingertips. I was halfway through my second cup of coffee when the doorbell rang.

Alfred reappeared, holding a long white box. "Delivery for you, madam."

Inside lay a single white orchid and a note in Nathaniel's precise handwriting: "For my brilliant wife. Knock them dead today. -N"

I smiled despite myself, tucking the flower into my briefcase. The grandfather clock in the foyer chimed eight times. Time to face the dragons.

The elevator doors opened directly into the Martin Group executive floor. Samuel Yates stood waiting, his tablet already in hand. "Mrs. Martin, we have a situation. Summit's project manager Jonathan Blake is insisting on structural changes that would require completely reworking the west wing."

I took the tablet, scanning the new demands. "These aren't just modifications, these are entirely different load-bearing requirements." My stomach dropped as I recognized the implications. "They want to add three more floors without changing the foundation specs? That's not just difficult, it's physically impossible."

Samuel's grim expression confirmed my assessment. "Mr. Martin is already in with them. He asked me to bring you straight there when you arrived."

The conference room doors loomed ahead, their polished wood surface reflecting the tense set of my shoulders. Through the glass walls, I could see Nathaniel at the head of the table, his posture deceptively relaxed as he listened to Sebastian Wilson's animated gestures. Isabella sat to Sebastian's right, her designer glasses glinting as she nodded along.

I took a deep breath, adjusting the orchid in my lapel. Time to prove why Martin Group had chosen my design over hers.

"Of course not. She was exhausted last night. Calling this early might disturb her rest, so I answered for her."

The mention of her exhaustion drained the color from Gregory's face, leaving him speechless.

Nathaniel cut in again, his voice sharp. "Gregory, remember that Evelyn is a married woman. Do you understand the implications of your actions? If this gets out, can you still stay at Mayby? If you want to avoid humiliation, keep your distance. Even years of friendship won’t save you."

Without waiting for a response, Nathaniel ended the call abruptly.

His grip on the phone tightened, his expression composed, but his eyes were icy.

This Gregory is relentless.

He switched the phone to silent mode and left the bedroom.

Evelyn slept until half past nine, stretching as she reached for her phone. The moment she saw the screen, she bolted upright.

Multiple missed calls and WhatsApp messages—all from one person.

[Evelyn, why aren’t you answering? Are you upset about what I said last night?]
[Are you really angry?]
[You’re still coming to dinner tonight, right?]

She ran a hand through her hair and quickly replied: [Sorry, just woke up. Not upset. Of course, I’ll be there tonight.]

A relieved emoji popped up immediately: [Good. Don’t bother coming by during the day. I’ll wander around Mayby on my own. See you tonight.]

Evelyn typed: [Okay.]

Then she got out of bed.

The curtains were drawn tight, blocking out any hint of daylight. What infuriated her more was Nathaniel’s audacity to silence her phone. With a sigh, she immediately changed her password and removed his fingerprint access.

After freshening up and grabbing breakfast downstairs, she drove to the office.

She rarely arrived this late. The moment she stepped into her office, Gabrielle entered with a stack of design documents, beaming. "Ms. Mitchell, you look radiant today."

"Out with it. Do you need a day off?"

"No, I mean it. You’re glowing—like you’ve been kissed by love. Ms. Mitchell, are you in love?"

Evelyn’s expression flickered. Images from last night flashed in her mind, warmth creeping up her cheeks.

Gabrielle didn’t miss it. Her eyes widened. "Oh my god, you are in love!"

"No, I’m not."

"You are! I can see it! Who is it? Mr. Wilson? But you don’t look at him like that. Is it Mr. Martin? He and Mr. Wilson fought last time—was it over you...?"

"Gabrielle," Evelyn interrupted coolly, "do you not have work? Or are you so eager to gossip about your boss that you’d rather not keep your job?"

Evelyn wasn’t one to smile often, but when she did, it was mesmerizing. Right now, though, her face was all sharp edges and frost, radiating an unapproachable aura.

Gabrielle straightened immediately. "Ms. Mitchell, I’ve organized these documents. Once you review them, I’ll take them to Mr. Carter at the construction site."

"I’ll look them over. If there are issues, I’ll let you know."

"Understood. I’ll leave now."

Gabrielle pressed her lips together, not daring another word, and scurried out.

Evelyn watched her go, shaking her head with a faint smile. She hadn’t truly been angry—just unwilling to entertain the conversation further.

By the time she finished reviewing the designs, it was already lunchtime.

Gregory had ordered food, and they ate in her office. He didn’t mention the morning’s incident, but his gaze lingered on the faint marks on her neck. His expression darkened.

"Evelyn," he ventured, "have things improved between you and Nathaniel?"

"Why do you ask?"

Improved? How could they? He doesn’t love me. There’s nothing to improve.

Gregory didn’t press. "Just a feeling."

"You’re mistaken. He doesn’t love me. There’s no ‘improvement’ to speak of." Her voice was soft, a fleeting sadness crossing her face before she smiled. "Let’s eat. I don’t want to talk about this."

Gregory merely hummed in response.

Then her phone rang.

It lay on the coffee table, the caller ID visible to both of them. She frowned and picked up.

"Hello?"

"At the office?"

"Yes."

"You should be resting."

Nathaniel’s low, smooth voice carried implications that made her skin prickle.

"I have work," she replied evenly. "Unlike you, who can skip the office and still have someone else do your job."

"Then come to Martin Group. I’ll give you the position. How about it?"

His tone was casual, but there was no jest in it.

Evelyn blinked. "What would you do?"

"I’ll assist you. Be your secretary. What do you say, Ms. Mitchell?"

The way he purred her title sent heat rushing to her cheeks.

"I’ll think about it," she muttered.

"Think hard. Give me an answer, hmm?" Then, "Eating lunch?"

"Yes."

"What are you having?"

"Chicken."

"Alone?"

Her gaze flicked to Gregory across from her. His expression was neutral, giving nothing away. She stood and walked to the window, lowering her voice. "No. I’m having lunch with Gregory."

Silence.

Then Nathaniel’s voice turned dangerously soft. "So you’d rather eat with him than come to Martin Group and have lunch with me?"

Evelyn was baffled.

"You never asked me to," she pointed out.

"Are you saying if I did, you’d turn him down and come to me?"

It was a challenge—one that demanded a satisfactory answer.
###Chapter 90

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of our penthouse, painting the marble floors with streaks of light. I stretched lazily, the silk sheets sliding against my skin as I turned to find Nathaniel already awake, his piercing blue eyes watching me with that familiar intensity.

"You're staring," I murmured, tucking a strand of hair behind my ear.

A slow smirk curved his lips. "Can't help it."

Before I could respond, his phone buzzed on the nightstand, shattering the quiet moment. He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening.

"Work?" I asked, already knowing the answer.

"Edward wants an urgent meeting." He sighed, running a hand through his tousled hair. "Something about the Summit Realty deal."

I sat up, frowning. "I thought that was finalized."

"So did I." His jaw tightened as he swung his legs off the bed, the muscles in his back flexing as he reached for his shirt. "I’ll handle it."

I watched him dress, the effortless grace in his movements making my pulse quicken. Even after all this time, he still had that effect on me.

Downstairs, Alfred had already prepared breakfast—fresh fruit, pastries, and steaming coffee. Nathaniel barely touched his plate, his mind clearly elsewhere.

"You should eat," I chided gently.

He shot me a distracted smile. "Later."

The doorbell rang, and Alfred moved to answer it. Moments later, Samuel Yates, Nathaniel’s ever-efficient secretary, strode in, his tablet in hand.

"Mr. Martin," he greeted briskly. "Edward’s waiting at the office. He’s brought Jonathan Blake with him."

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed. "Blake? Why?"

Samuel hesitated, then lowered his voice. "There’s been a complication with the zoning permits. The city council is raising objections."

I set down my coffee cup, unease prickling at the back of my neck. This wasn’t just a minor hiccup—it was a potential disaster for the project.

Nathaniel stood abruptly. "Let’s go."

He leaned down, pressing a quick kiss to my forehead. "Don’t wait up. This might take a while."

I nodded, forcing a smile. "Good luck."

As the door closed behind him, I exhaled slowly, my fingers tightening around my cup. Something about this felt off. Edward Martin didn’t make unannounced visits unless it was serious.

And if he’d brought Jonathan Blake into it?

This wasn’t just business.

This was a power play.

And Nathaniel was walking right into it.

Evelyn couldn’t fathom why Nathaniel had been acting so childish lately, picking petty arguments with Gregory as if they were schoolboys.

She didn’t dwell on it, though. Instead, she glanced at the clock and said, "It’s getting late. You should eat. I still have work to finish, so I’ll let you go now, alright?"

Nathaniel didn’t respond—whether he was upset or not, she couldn’t tell—but he ended the call abruptly.

When she returned to the sofa, Gregory had already set the table. He waited for her to sit before placing a piece of chicken on her plate. Evelyn raised a brow. "Aren’t you eating?"

"I was waiting for you."

The words caught her off guard, and for a moment, she just stared. Gregory didn’t elaborate.

His dark eyes held a quiet warmth as they lingered on her. He always waited—even when he knew it might lead nowhere. Some habits were hard to break.

After dinner, Evelyn reviewed the blueprints and documents one last time before instructing Gabrielle to send them to Daniel.

With no site visit scheduled, she spent the afternoon at the office, going over quarterly reports and other projects with Gregory.

Though their firm was small, their roles were clearly defined. Gregory handled operations and client relations seamlessly, leaving her free to focus on design. It was a partnership that worked—efficient, balanced, and refreshingly stress-free.

As they wrapped up, Gregory leaned back in his chair. "The Martin Group has a bid next month. It’s right in our niche. Should we go for it?"

Evelyn’s fingers stilled on the keyboard. She took the file he offered, scanning the requirements before exhaling. "I’ll think about it. What’s your take?"

"We could pull it off. Our size doesn’t matter when we’ve got the expertise."

"Mm."

She hesitated. Working with the Martins—even professionally—left a bitter taste.

Gregory read her silence. "If you’re not comfortable, we’ll pass. But given your involvement in their current project, they might come to us anyway. Just… be prepared."

Evelyn nodded. Logically, it was just business. But after everything, she wasn’t keen on walking back into that world. Not unless she had to.

At six, she packed up.

Gregory walked her to the elevator, eyeing her as she checked her phone twice in thirty seconds. "In a hurry?"

"Meeting a friend for dinner."

"Who?"

"Isaac."

Gregory’s brows lifted. "Isaac Whitman? What brings him to Mayby?"

They’d met briefly before—polite nods, nothing more.

"Work, I think—"

Her phone buzzed.

[Downstairs. Come now or I’m coming up.]

She smirked, typing back: [Two minutes.]

Gregory watched her. "You two still close?"

"Always. He helped me through grad school. Acts like a kid sometimes, but he’s got wisdom I still use."

Isaac was over a decade older, their bond forged during his peak fame. Time and distance hadn’t dulled it.

Gregory chuckled. "Evelyn… does he like you? The man’s never been linked to anyone. Is there a reason?"

Her expression iced over. "Don’t. That’s not fair to him—or me. He’s family. If there were anything else, I wouldn’t be here discussing it with you."

Her tone brooked no argument.

Gregory held up his hands. "Sorry. Overstepped."

The elevator dinged. They parted ways in the garage.

Evelyn pulled up to the building’s entrance, spotting Isaac’s car immediately. She rolled down her window. "Get in."

He slid into the passenger seat, tugging off his cap and mask. "That was more than two minutes."

"You once said waiting for a woman is a man’s privilege."

"Now you weaponize my words against me."

Laughing, she merged into traffic, following his directions to the restaurant.

They chatted easily, unaware of the sleek black sedan trailing them. Its driver watched, expression unreadable.

At the private dining room, their guest hadn’t arrived. Evelyn teased, "Must be a big favor you owe. They’re keeping you waiting."

"At my age, punctuality is overrated."

"Spoken like a man in his seventies."

"Compared to you, I might as well be."

She grinned. "Exactly. So, respect your elders and call me more. Don’t make me chase you down."

Isaac’s voice was light, but his eyes softened as he ruffled her hair.

Evelyn swatted at him. "Stop! You’ll regret it when I walk out looking like a mess."

"I don’t mind—"

The door swung open.

Both froze mid-tussle.

Four pairs of eyes locked—three surprised, one unreadable.

Isaac withdrew his hand smoothly. "Mr. Martin. It’s been a while."

Nathaniel stepped inside, Isabella on his arm. "Mr. Whitman."

Isabella beamed. "I’m such a fan! Isabella Davis."

"Ms. Davis." Isaac’s smile was polite but distant.

Evelyn stayed silent. Of all people, she hadn’t expected Nathaniel and Isabella to be Isaac’s guests.

Then Nathaniel’s gaze cut to her, cool and deliberate. "Mr. Whitman, won’t you introduce your companion?"

###Chapter 91

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden patterns across the bedroom floor. Evelyn stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

She sighed, rolling onto her back. The silence of the house was deafening.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory: "Meeting in an hour. Don’t be late."

Evelyn groaned. She had completely forgotten about the client presentation. Throwing off the covers, she hurried to the shower, the warm water doing little to ease the tension in her shoulders.

By the time she arrived at the office, Gabrielle was already waiting with a stack of blueprints. "You look like you’ve been through a war," her assistant remarked, handing her a much-needed coffee.

"Feels like it," Evelyn muttered, flipping through the designs.

The meeting went smoothly—until it didn’t.

Halfway through her presentation, the conference room door swung open. Nathaniel stood there, his expression unreadable.

Everyone turned to stare.

Evelyn’s breath hitched. "Nathaniel? What are you doing here?"

He didn’t answer immediately. Instead, his gaze swept over the room before landing back on her. "We need to talk."

Her stomach twisted. Something was wrong.

Gregory cleared his throat. "Perhaps we should take a short break?"

Nathaniel didn’t wait for a response. He turned on his heel and walked out.

Evelyn excused herself and followed, her heels clicking against the marble floor. She caught up to him in the hallway. "Nathaniel, what’s going on?"

He stopped abruptly, his jaw clenched. "Isabella’s back."

The name hit her like a punch to the gut. Isabella—his ex, his first love. The woman who had shattered his heart before Evelyn had even met him.

"And?" Evelyn forced her voice to remain steady.

Nathaniel finally met her eyes. "She wants to see me."

The air between them thickened with unspoken words. Evelyn swallowed hard. "When?"

"Tonight."

Her fingers curled into fists at her sides. "And you’re telling me this why?"

His expression softened, just slightly. "Because I wanted you to hear it from me first."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Fine. Go see her. But don’t expect me to be okay with it."

She turned to leave, but Nathaniel caught her wrist. "Evelyn—"

She yanked her arm free. "Not here. Not now."

Without another word, she walked away, her heart pounding in her chest.

Isabella was back.

And nothing would ever be the same again.

Nathaniel's lips curved into a faint smile as he gestured toward Evelyn. "This is Evelyn Mitchell, a dear friend of mine. She's currently working in Mayby. I'd appreciate it if you could look out for her, Mr. Martin."

"A dear friend?" Nathaniel repeated the words with deliberate emphasis, his voice dropping an octave.

Isabella visibly paled, her gaze darting toward Evelyn with barely concealed surprise.

Nathaniel simply nodded. "Indeed."

Evelyn maintained her polite facade, offering a practiced smile. "Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Martin."

"The pleasure is mine, Ms. Mitchell." His response was cool, his piercing gaze lingering on her just a moment too long before turning away. Yet Evelyn could feel the storm brewing beneath his composed exterior.

The arrival of their meal provided temporary relief as the four began dining. Through Nathaniel and Isabella's conversation, Evelyn learned they'd known each other for years - their connection stemming from Isabella's college professor who happened to be Nathaniel's longtime friend.

As the men talked, Isabella seized the opportunity to demonstrate her familiarity with Nathaniel, serving him soup with practiced ease before addressing Isabella. "Mr. Whitman, what an honor to meet you. What a coincidence that we're both in the same industry."

Isabella offered a polite nod but remained silent.

Undeterred, Isabella pressed on. "Mr. Whitman, Nathaniel specifically invited you to Mayby hoping you'd compose for my new single. I understand you've retired, but just this once..."

She deliberately emphasized Nathaniel's involvement, implying their special relationship would sway Isabella's decision.

Isabella took a measured sip from his glass, his smile never wavering. After allowing her to finish, he turned to Nathaniel. "Is this truly your wish, Mr. Martin?"

"I'm merely making the introduction. If you find her suitable, by all means." Nathaniel leaned back, his expression unreadable.

Isabella interjected eagerly, "Mr. Whitman, I'd love the chance to collaborate. Please listen to my previous work - I promise you won't be disappointed."

"Ms. Davis, my apologies but I must decline. Retirement means exactly that - no exceptions." Isabella's tone was final.

"But your talent is being wasted! Your fans want you back. If you prefer anonymity, we needn't credit you-"

Isabella chuckled, interrupting her. "Ms. Davis, my style is unmistakable. Do you honestly believe my involvement could remain secret?"

Isabella had cultivated a distinctive musical signature over the years - impossible to disguise.

Frustration flashed across Isabella's face as she turned to Nathaniel. "Nathaniel, please..."

"Mr. Whitman, is there truly no reconsideration?"

"Mr. Martin, I came to Mayby as a personal favor. The only song I owe is to Evelyn here. Beyond that, I have no plans to compose for anyone else."

Isabella was notoriously uncompromising - a man who followed his own rules, answerable to no one. This very quality had cemented his legendary status in the industry.

Convinced of Evelyn's interference, Isabella blurted, "Mr. Whitman, has Evelyn said something about me? Whatever past misunderstandings we've had, you can't question my professionalism because of them!"

Isabella's expression darkened. "Are you questioning my integrity? Or my judgment? Evelyn is my friend. You will apologize to her immediately."

Isabella's eyes widened in disbelief. "It's obvious Evelyn's poisoned you against me! I'm not doubting you, just trying to salvage this opportunity-"

"Your arrogance is astounding," Isabella cut in coldly. "Do you imagine I came here today for you? Even the biggest stars wouldn't dare address me so disrespectfully."

The truth of his words silenced her. Lips pressed tight, she looked to Nathaniel for support but found none.

"Apologize to Evelyn," Isabella repeated. "Or this meeting is over."

"I...I didn't mean...I just wanted this collaboration so badly..."

"Your words were directed at the wrong person, Ms. Davis."

Cornered, Isabella turned to Evelyn. "My apologies for the misunderstanding."

Evelyn remained silent, deliberately ignoring the apology as she sipped her water before telling Isabella calmly, "I appreciate the thought, but my voice isn't suited for singing. Let's drop it."

"Stop making excuses," Isabella chided playfully. "Even Cole would drag himself here with his cane to scold you for that."

"Careful, or I'll tell on you."

"After all his harsh treatment, you still defend him?"

"Mr. Whitman, need I remind you he's your father?"

Their easy banter revealed years of familiarity, making Nathaniel's expression grow colder while Isabella stiffened beside him.

"Nathaniel," she whispered desperately, "I don't know what to do."

"Apologize properly. Unless this collaboration means nothing to you?"

Left with no choice, Isabella raised her glass. "Evelyn, let me toast you with water since we're not drinking. I sincerely apologize for my earlier words. Please don't hold it against me."

"Unnecessary, Ms. Davis," Evelyn replied coolly. "Our relationship doesn't warrant such formalities. Whether I care or not is hardly your concern - you're responsible for your own words."

The blunt dismissal left Isabella seething but powerless, secretly vowing revenge that would remove Evelyn from Nathaniel's orbit permanently.

The meal continued awkwardly until, for Nathaniel's sake, Isabella offered Isabella a conciliatory remark: "You're talented. With time, perhaps we'll collaborate."

Isabella's smile didn't reach her eyes.

Later, as Evelyn walked Isabella to his car, he asked quietly, "What's between you and Isabella?"
###Chapter 92

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, blinking against the light, her body still heavy with sleep. The space beside her was empty, the sheets cool—Nathaniel had already left for work.

She stretched, her muscles protesting slightly from the previous night’s events. The gala had been exhausting, but worth it. The Martin Group’s latest project had been unveiled to resounding success, and Nathaniel had been in rare form—charming, confident, and utterly magnetic.

Evelyn reached for her phone, scrolling through the flood of notifications. Messages from Gregory, her business partner, about an upcoming client meeting. A missed call from her sister, Sophia. And then—her thumb stilled.

An email from Isabella Davis.

Her stomach tightened. Isabella, Nathaniel’s ex, had been a ghost from the past for years—until recently. Now, she seemed determined to claw her way back into their lives.

Evelyn hesitated before opening it.

"Evelyn, we need to talk. It’s about Nathaniel."

The words were simple, but the implication was anything but. Evelyn exhaled sharply, tossing the phone onto the bed. She wasn’t going to let Isabella rattle her. Not today.

She dressed quickly, opting for a sleek black pantsuit—armor for whatever the day might throw at her. Downstairs, Alfred, their butler, had already prepared coffee.

“Good morning, Mrs. Martin,” he greeted, handing her a steaming cup.

“Morning, Alfred.” She took a sip, the rich bitterness grounding her. “Has Nathaniel left already?”

“Yes, ma’am. He mentioned an early meeting with Mr. Yates.”

She nodded. Samuel Yates, Nathaniel’s ever-efficient secretary, was likely already briefing him on the day’s agenda.

Her phone buzzed again—another message from Gregory.

"Client moved the meeting to 10 AM. You’re presenting. Don’t be late."

Evelyn groaned. She loved her work, but some days, the universe seemed determined to test her patience.

As she headed out, her phone rang—an unknown number. She answered cautiously.

“Evelyn Mitchell?” A smooth, unfamiliar voice.

“Speaking.”

“This is Vanessa. Isabella’s agent.”

Evelyn’s grip on the phone tightened. “What do you want?”

Vanessa’s tone was honeyed, but there was an edge beneath it. “Isabella would like to meet. Today. She has something important to discuss.”

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. “If it’s about Nathaniel, she can take it up with him.”

A pause. Then, softly, “It’s not just about him. It’s about you, too.”

The line went dead before Evelyn could respond.

She stood frozen on the sidewalk, the city bustling around her. Whatever game Isabella was playing, Evelyn refused to be a pawn.

But first—she had a presentation to nail.

The meeting went better than expected. The clients loved her vision, and Gregory shot her an approving nod as they wrapped up.

“You killed it,” he murmured as they exited the conference room.

She smirked. “I know.”

Her phone buzzed—another message. This time, from Nathaniel.

"Dinner tonight? Just us."

A small smile tugged at her lips. Maybe today wouldn’t be so bad after all.

Then, another notification. A photo.

Her breath caught.

It was Nathaniel—with Isabella.

The caption read: "Some things never change."

Evelyn’s world tilted.

Game on.

"More or less?"

"Why do you ask?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Just typical girl things—probably not wanting to admit someone else is prettier."

Nathaniel chuckled, his voice low and smooth. "She doesn't hold a candle to you."

"I'll take that as a compliment."

Evelyn pulled up to the hotel entrance, shifting the car into park. Before Nathaniel could step out, she turned to him. "Are you really not considering working with Isabella? If it's because of me, don't worry. It won't affect your reputation. We're not close, so there's no reason for you to hold back."

"Are you trying to gauge how much you mean to me?"

Evelyn's brows knitted slightly, her gaze cool and detached, as if silently warning him not to read too much into it.

Nathaniel's expression sobered. "It's not about you or anyone else. It's my own choice. Plenty like Isabella have approached me—people with influence, unique talents, status. I've turned them all down. If I make one exception, the floodgates open. I prefer to stay neutral in industry circles, avoid making enemies. The simplest solution? Say no to everyone."

"What did you tell Isabella in the end?"

"A polite refusal. I couldn't exactly say, 'Ms. Davis, I have no interest in collaborating with you. Kindly stop contacting me,' could I?"

Evelyn smirked. "Another lesson learned. Thanks, Nathaniel."

She watched him disappear into the hotel before driving back to Pineview Villa.

Nathaniel's car was already in the garage, but the house was dark. Had he come home early just to sleep?

Evelyn stepped inside, still lost in thought, when suddenly strong arms wrapped around her from behind before she could even slip on her shoes.

She gasped. "Ah!"

The familiar warmth and scent told her who it was. She relaxed, then sighed. "What are you doing?"

Still barefoot, she was pressed against the wall, his body caging her in. Their faces were inches apart, breaths mingling.

In the dim light, his dark eyes bore into hers, sharp with accusation. His voice was icy. "So, Nathaniel was the friend you hadn't seen in ages—the one worth dolling up for?"

His displeasure was palpable, his handsome features carved in frost.

Evelyn bit her lip. "Yes."

"Evelyn, why do you have so many male friends? Wasn't Gregory enough? Now Nathaniel? What's your game?"

His tone was deceptively calm, but the edge was unmistakable.

Evelyn exhaled silently. "Nathaniel is my teacher's son."

She didn’t understand Nathaniel's sudden possessiveness. He could mention her male friends, but what about him? Didn’t he have Isabella, the woman he’d once loved?

Double standards much?

Nathaniel sighed. "If he's your teacher's son, why not invite him for dinner? We could host him here."

"He doesn’t know we’re married. There’s no need."

"He doesn’t know? You didn’t tell him, or you chose not to?"

His voice was frigid, laced with displeasure.

Evelyn resisted the urge to roll her eyes. "I just didn’t find the right moment to blurt out, 'Hey Nathaniel, guess what? I’m married now!' He’d think I’d lost it."

Their marriage was supposed to be private. If she spilled the secret without his consent, would Isabella be happy? And if Isabella wasn’t happy—wouldn’t that mean he wasn’t?

The irony wasn’t lost on her.

Evelyn didn’t want to argue. She pushed against his chest lightly. "The floor’s cold. I’m not wearing shoes."

Nathaniel stepped back, watching as she slid into her slippers. Then, coolly, he said, "Since you missed the chance to tell him, we’ll invite Nathaniel to dinner while he’s in Mayby. A gesture of gratitude for his father’s guidance. Your teacher should know his prized student is married, don’t you think?"

"Nathaniel, aren’t you worried that if he knows we’re married, Isabella will be upset? Don’t you want him to work with her?"

"Whether they collaborate isn’t my call. If Nathaniel sees something in her, he’ll agree."

"Aren’t you afraid of making Isabella unhappy?"

She searched his eyes.

"We are married. That’s not new information."

His tone was flat, stating facts.

Evelyn blinked. What did that mean?

That Isabella’s happiness—or lack thereof—was already a given? That it didn’t matter anymore?

She exhaled. "I can’t promise anything. I’ll have to ask Nathaniel first."

"Fine. I’m sure Mr. Whitman will be agreeable."

"I’ll confirm with you after I speak to him."

Relief washed over her as Nathaniel finally dropped the subject.

Exhausted, Evelyn showered and climbed into bed.

But questions swirled in her mind. Nathaniel had been different lately—more controlling, more possessive.

What was going on with him?

With those thoughts, she drifted into sleep.

Nathaniel stayed up longer. Listening to her steady breathing, he slipped out of bed, soundless, and stepped onto the balcony. He dialed a number.

"What did you find?"

"Mrs. Martin and Mr. Whitman have known each other since high school. His father was her homeroom teacher. Their relationship stems from that."

"Is that all?" Nathaniel’s voice was devoid of inflection.

Samuel replied, "Yes. From what we’ve gathered, those who know them describe their bond as sibling-like. Nothing more."

"Siblings?"

Nathaniel’s face darkened, his eyes turning glacial.

Samuel continued, "That’s the extent of it. Mrs. Martin spent most of her high school years at the Whitman residence due to her grandmother’s poor health..."

"The Mitchells really let their daughter live elsewhere without a second thought?" Nathaniel’s voice dripped with disdain.

Then, softly, he added, "If the Mitchells are so negligent, let’s see how far they’ll go. Their new project is about to launch, correct? Spread the word—the Martin Group won’t be backing it."

"Sir, won’t this upset Mrs. Martin?" Samuel asked cautiously.

###Chapter 93

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of our penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. I stretched beneath the silk sheets, my fingers brushing against the cold space where Nathaniel should have been. The digital clock on the nightstand blinked 7:32 AM in bold red numbers.

"Alfred?" I called out, my voice still thick with sleep.

The door opened immediately, revealing our ever-efficient butler. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin. Mr. Martin left for the office two hours ago. He asked me to inform you he has an important meeting with the Japanese investors today."

I sighed, rubbing my temples. Another morning without him. The merger with Tanaka Corporation had consumed Nathaniel completely these past weeks. "Please have Rosalind prepare my usual breakfast. And tell Gabrielle I'll be in the office by nine."

As I stepped into the shower, the hot water did little to ease the tension in my shoulders. My architectural firm's deadline for the waterfront project loomed closer, and Gregory had been sending increasingly frantic messages about zoning permits. The steam fogged up the mirror as I toweled off, obscuring my reflection - much like how my life had become lately, blurred at the edges from exhaustion.

The dining table was set with precision - fresh orange juice in a crystal glass, avocado toast arranged artfully on bone china, and a single red rose in a slender vase. Rosalind's quiet efficiency reminded me of Alfred, though her pastries were far superior. I was halfway through my coffee when my phone buzzed.

A text from Caroline: "Emergency brunch needed. The hospital just assigned me to the night shift rotation. Save me from this caffeine-deprived hell?"

I smiled despite myself. My cousin never changed. Typing a quick reply, I promised to meet her at our usual café after my morning site inspection.

The elevator doors opened to reveal Gabrielle holding two steaming to-go cups, her auburn hair pulled into a messy bun. "Double shot espresso, just how you like it," she said, handing me one. "Gregory's already at the construction site. Apparently, the city inspector showed up unannounced."

I groaned, taking a scalding sip. "Of course he did. Because today wasn't stressful enough already." The car ride passed in a blur of phone calls and last-minute revisions to blueprints. By the time we arrived at the waterfront, my coffee was gone and my patience was wearing thin.

The construction site buzzed with activity, workers moving like ants across the steel skeleton of what would become the city's newest luxury condominium. Gregory stood near the foundation, gesturing animatedly at a man in a hard hat holding a clipboard. His salt-and-pepper hair was more disheveled than usual, a sure sign of trouble.

"Evelyn, thank God," he said, spotting me. "This gentleman seems to think our cantilever design violates the new coastal construction codes."

I extended my hand to the inspector, forcing a professional smile. "I assure you, we've accounted for all the updated regulations. If you'll come to the trailer, I can show you the revised schematics."

Three hours and countless technical explanations later, the inspector finally left with a grudging approval. Gregory collapsed into a folding chair, wiping his brow. "Remind me why we took this project again?"

"Because it's our biggest commission yet," I said, massaging my aching temples. "And because we're gluttons for punishment."

My phone chimed with a calendar reminder: "Lunch with V.M. - 1 PM." Victoria Martin's monthly "casual" lunches were anything but, though I'd learned to navigate them with practiced ease. Today's venue was a new French bistro downtown, no doubt chosen for its exclusivity rather than its cuisine.

I arrived five minutes early, as always, to find Victoria already seated at a secluded corner table. She looked immaculate as usual, her silver-blonde hair swept into a chignon, a strand of pearls at her throat. "Evelyn, darling," she said, air-kissing my cheeks. "You look exhausted."

"Just busy with the waterfront project," I said, accepting the menu from the waiter. "Nathaniel sends his regrets - he's in meetings all day."

Victoria's lips pursed slightly. "That boy works too hard. Though I suppose he comes by it honestly." She sipped her mineral water. "Speaking of which, Edward has been asking about you both. He wants the family at the estate this weekend for dinner."

I kept my expression neutral, though my stomach tightened. Family dinners at the Martin estate were minefields disguised as social gatherings. "I'll check with Nathaniel, but we should be able to make it."

The conversation turned to safer topics - the upcoming charity gala, Victoria's garden club, the dreadful state of modern architecture (a not-so-subtle dig at my profession). By the time dessert arrived - a ridiculously elaborate chocolate soufflé - my phone buzzed with a text from Nathaniel: "Emergency at the office. Have to cancel our dinner plans. So sorry, love."

I stared at the message, the sweet dessert suddenly tasting like ash. Another cancelled date. Another night alone. Victoria noticed my expression and reached across the table, her manicured fingers brushing mine. "He'll slow down eventually, dear. All Martin men do... usually around their first heart attack."

It was meant to be comforting. It wasn't.

The afternoon passed in a haze of meetings and emails. By seven o'clock, even Gabrielle looked ready to collapse. "Go home," I told her, shutting down my computer. "I'll finish these renderings tomorrow."

The penthouse was dark when I arrived, Alfred's note on the foyer table informing me Nathaniel was still at the office. I changed into sweatpants and an old MIT hoodie, pouring myself a generous glass of cabernet before curling up on the sofa. The television played some forgettable rom-com, the volume low as I scrolled through my phone.

A notification popped up - a tagged photo from Isabella Davis's Instagram. My thumb hovered over it before I could stop myself. The image loaded to reveal Isabella at some glamorous event, her arm linked with a familiar broad-shouldered figure in a tuxedo. Nathaniel. Smiling. At a gala I hadn't even known he was attending.

The timestamp showed the photo was taken two hours ago.

The wine glass slipped from my fingers, shattering on the marble floor like my carefully constructed composure. Red liquid spread across the pale stone like blood, seeping into the grout where no amount of scrubbing would ever fully remove the stain.

"It's merely a standard corporate decision. Why should Evelyn be upset? Besides, how does the Mitchell Group's project benefit the Martin Group? There's nothing wrong with prioritizing the Martin Group's growth over a less significant venture."

After ending the call, Nathaniel didn’t return to the bedroom immediately. Instead, he lingered on the balcony, lighting a cigarette. His expression was unreadable as he recalled the image of Evelyn chatting with Isaac in the private room—so relaxed, so unguarded. It was a side of her he rarely saw, one that stirred an unfamiliar discomfort in his chest.

A sharp, unwelcome irritation coiled inside him.

They were husband and wife. As long as they remained married, every part of her belonged to him.

Yet something was shifting beyond his control, slipping through his fingers like smoke. Nathaniel couldn’t quite name the feeling, but it unsettled him.

When Evelyn woke the next morning, Nathaniel was already gone.

After breakfast, she headed to the office.

On the way, Isaac called. "Are you free tonight? Cole’s friend is having a birthday party, and I need a plus-one."

"So you came to Mayby to do Cole a favor?"

"If I'd known it would be this troublesome, I would’ve refused," Isaac grumbled.

Evelyn laughed. "He should’ve worked on your social anxiety years ago."

"Enough. Just pick me up tonight. I’ll be leaving in a couple of days anyway."

"Fine. Do I need to bring anything?"

Isaac considered it. "No, the gift’s already taken care of."

After hanging up, Evelyn realized she hadn’t told Isaac about the dinner yet. She could already imagine his reaction when she and Nathaniel eventually divorced. He’d tease her mercilessly—especially since he knew she’d only just gotten married.

Shaking her head, she pushed the thought aside and texted Nathaniel.

[Nathaniel, I’m attending a birthday party with Isaac tonight. I’ll be home late.]

His reply was curt.

[Fine.]

One word, loaded with unspoken tension.

Evelyn frowned but didn’t respond further—the Mitchell Group’s PR team had just arrived.

She and Gregory received them. The PR manager smiled warmly. "The Mitchell Group is interested in collaborating with your firm. Mr. William Mitchell admires your design aesthetic—it aligns perfectly with our new youthful vitality campaign. Would you consider partnering with us?"

Evelyn’s identity wasn’t public knowledge. Few knew of her connection to the Mitchell Group, and certainly not their employees.

Gregory handled the response smoothly. "We’re honored the Mitchell Group would consider us. However, we’re currently engaged with the Martin Group and need to assess our capacity before committing."

"Understandable. But do think it over. And Ms. Mitchell—what a coincidence, sharing our name. We’d ensure favorable terms for you."

Evelyn offered a polite smile. The decision required more deliberation.

After seeing them out, Evelyn turned to Gregory. "They approached us awfully fast."

"You haven’t heard? The Martin Group issued a statement withdrawing support for their project. It’s a subtle way of declaring they won’t work with the Mitchell Group—and now others are following suit."

The Martin Group’s influence was undeniable. No one dared oppose them.

Evelyn stiffened.

Why was Nathaniel suddenly targeting the Mitchell Group?

She pulled up the news Gregory mentioned—already topping business headlines.

Her brow furrowed. "Why now?"

"He didn’t mention it to you?"

"We don’t discuss work." She shook her head, baffled.

Gregory studied her. "Any recent arguments?"

"No."

"Maybe he’s retaliating for how the Mitchells treated you?"

Evelyn dismissed it. "If he cared about that, he would’ve acted sooner."

So what was the reason?

But this was the Martin Group’s affair. Even as Nathaniel’s wife, she had no right to interfere.

The Mitchells, however, had other ideas.

William’s blood pressure spiked when he saw the news. He called Nathaniel immediately—no answer. Finally, he reached Samuel, who said, "Mr. Martin is in a meeting. Please call back later."

Frustrated, William turned to Evelyn.

Gregory had warned her. "Evelyn, the Mitchell Group stands to lose a lot. Your father will call. What will you say?"

Before she could answer, her phone rang.

William didn’t wait for pleasantries. "Did you fight with Nathaniel? Why would the Martin Group sabotage us? Evelyn, apologize to him and get that statement retracted!"

Evelyn listened silently, her grip tightening on the phone.

"You think Nathaniel did this because of me?"

"Of course! Control your temper. Stop talking about divorce—it’s causing problems for the family!"

His words were sharp, demanding.

Evelyn’s voice turned icy. "Nathaniel and I are fine. This has nothing to do with me."

"Then talk to him! The Mitchell Group can’t afford setbacks right now!"

She exhaled slowly. "I can’t help you. The Martin Group’s decisions aren’t mine to influence."

"What kind of answer is that?"

William’s fury crackled through the line, but Evelyn remained unmoved.

Later, Margaret called, her tone laced with accusation. Evelyn had heard it all before—yet each time still stung.

Gregory placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Evelyn..."

She forced a smile, but the weight of her family’s indifference pressed down, heavier than ever.
###Chapter 94

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples as she reviewed the latest blueprints for the Martin Group's new resort. The project was demanding, but she thrived under pressure.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Come in," she called, glancing up as Gabrielle, her assistant, entered with a tray of coffee.

"You've been at it for hours," Gabrielle said, setting the tray down. "Thought you could use a break."

Evelyn smiled gratefully. "You're a lifesaver." She took a sip, savoring the rich aroma.

Gabrielle hesitated. "Nathaniel called earlier. He said he’d be late tonight—another meeting with the investors."

Evelyn’s grip tightened slightly around the cup. Lately, Nathaniel had been distant, buried under the weight of his family’s expectations. She understood, but the growing distance between them gnawed at her.

"Did he say when he’d be back?" she asked, keeping her voice steady.

Gabrielle shook her head. "Just that he’d text you."

Evelyn exhaled slowly. "Thanks for letting me know."

As Gabrielle left, Evelyn turned back to her work, but her focus had shattered. She tapped her pen against the desk, her mind drifting to the whispered rumors she’d overheard at last week’s gala—rumors about Nathaniel and Isabella Davis, his ex, being seen together.

She shook her head. No, he wouldn’t.

But doubt lingered.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Charlotte.

"Girls’ night. My place. Wine and venting. You in?"

Evelyn hesitated, then typed back: "I’ll be there."

Maybe a distraction was exactly what she needed.

Meanwhile, across town, Nathaniel sat in his office, staring at the contract in front of him. The numbers blurred as his thoughts wandered.

Samuel Yates cleared his throat. "Sir? The investors are waiting for your signature."

Nathaniel blinked, forcing himself back to the present. "Right." He signed the papers mechanically.

"Everything alright?" Samuel asked carefully.

Nathaniel hesitated. "Just tired."

But it was more than that. The weight of his family’s legacy, the expectations, the constant scrutiny—it was suffocating. And then there was Evelyn.

He missed her. Missed the way she’d tease him out of his bad moods, the way her laughter filled the silence. But lately, every conversation felt strained, every touch hesitant.

His phone lit up with a message from Isabella: "We need to talk. It’s important."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. He’d been avoiding her, but he knew he couldn’t forever.

With a sigh, he replied: "Meet me at the usual place. 8 PM."

As he pocketed his phone, a sense of foreboding settled over him. Whatever Isabella wanted, it wouldn’t be good.

And he had a sinking feeling it would only drive Evelyn further away.

"Gregory, I'm fine. Don't say anything. I just need some quiet time."

"Alright, I'll step out then. Take all the time you need. If you need anything, I'm here for you."

"Thanks."

She forced a small smile.

That evening, Evelyn arrived at the lavish birthday party with Nathaniel, held in an opulent villa in Mayby's elite neighborhood—home to the city's wealthiest families.

The host, Simon Gilbert, personally greeted Nathaniel's arrival. They exchanged pleasantries for quite some time, and even Evelyn, as his companion, received VIP treatment.

"Mr. Martin, Ms. Mitchell, enjoy the evening. With so many guests tonight, I apologize if I can't attend to you as I'd like."

Nathaniel gave a slight nod. "No need for apologies."

Just then, Simon's assistant hurried over. "Mr. Gilbert, Mr. Edward from Martin Group has arrived."

"Mr. Edward?" Simon's face lit up with surprise.

He turned back to Nathaniel. "Mr. Martin, please excuse me. Someone will escort you to your seats. I'll join you for a drink later."

"Of course, Mr. Gilbert. Don’t let us keep you."

Simon rushed off. Through the crowd, Evelyn spotted him heading toward a distinguished-looking couple. She studied the man, only for Nathaniel's voice to pull her attention back.

"Edward is here too. What a coincidence."

"We all move in the same circles. It's inevitable."

"Yet this party hardly matches his status. Did you see Simon's reaction?" Nathaniel glanced at her. "Shall we find our seats?"

"Sure." Evelyn withdrew her gaze—but not before locking eyes with the man in the gray suit, his expression unreadable.

Nathaniel led her to the lounge area, where he proved to be the perfect escort, attentive and composed. Many recognized him, but his aloof demeanor kept most at bay. Those bold enough to approach received only curt replies.

Evelyn smirked. "You really know how to charm a crowd."

Nathaniel shot her a look but said nothing.

She laughed softly.

Just then, Isabella approached on Edward's arm, her voice dripping with sweetness before they even reached them.

"What's so amusing, Mr. Martin and Evelyn? Care to share with us?"

Evelyn's smile vanished, replaced by icy indifference. Nathaniel remained composed, offering only a polite nod.

Isabella continued, feigning innocence. "Edward, have you noticed how Mr. Martin dotes on Evelyn? I can't help but wonder if there's something more between them."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "Why don’t you announce it to the entire room, Isabella? Make sure everyone hears your speculation."

The sweeter the facade, the sharper the claws beneath.

Isabella gasped, playing the wounded victim. "How cruel! I merely observed that you two seem close."

Evelyn scoffed. "And why do you care about my relationships?"

Nathaniel interjected calmly. "Ms. Davis, Evelyn isn’t seeing anyone. Your words could cause misunderstandings. Best to drop it."

Isabella feigned embarrassment. "My apologies, Mr. Martin. I didn’t mean to assume."

"An apology doesn’t erase the implication," Evelyn countered. "Should criminals just say sorry and walk free?"

Nathaniel’s lips curved slightly. "Evelyn, any more of this, and Ms. Davis might burst into tears." Then, to Isabella, "She’s spoiled. You understand, don’t you?"

His words left Isabella speechless. She glanced at Edward, but his gaze never left Evelyn—cold, calculating.

The tension thickened until Edward finally spoke. "Mr. Martin, shall we share a drink?"

"Certainly."

The two men raised their glasses, while Evelyn and Isabella sat in strained silence.

Though not close, Nathaniel and Edward conversed effortlessly—business, politics, even art. Their exchange was smooth, but Evelyn felt Edward’s piercing stare the entire time.

Unable to bear it, she stood abruptly. "Excuse me. I need the restroom."

Nathaniel nodded, his eyes flickering to Edward, who met his gaze with equal intensity.

"Confused?" Nathaniel asked lightly.

"Not particularly," Edward replied.

Nathaniel sipped his wine. "I studied psychology. A person’s thoughts are often written on their face."

"Oh? Can you read mine?"

"Not entirely. Men like you are the hardest to decipher."

Their cryptic exchange left Isabella lost. She leaned in eagerly. "Then tell us, what is Edward thinking?"

Edward remained silent.

Nathaniel smiled. "That would require his consent. Professional ethics, you understand."

Isabella paled, sensing the veiled mockery. She pressed her lips together, fists clenched.

Edward finally spoke, his voice low. "Go on. Tell me."

"Do you really want me to?"

"By all means."

Nathaniel’s gaze flickered to Evelyn’s empty seat. "You’re troubled by a woman you’re intimately connected to."

Isabella’s breath hitched. Her wide eyes darted to Edward, searching for denial—but found none.

Her mind raced. Who? Evelyn? Impossible.

Before she could react, Edward’s phone buzzed. He excused himself and strode away, leaving Isabella seething.

The moment he was gone, she whirled on Nathaniel. "Do you have feelings for Evelyn?"

Evelyn had just dried her hands when the bathroom door burst open. A tall figure pinned her against the sink, his familiar scent enveloping her.

Edward’s smirk was infuriatingly charming as he whispered, "Nathaniel says you’re single. So, who am I? Still keeping our relationship a secret?"
###Chapter 95

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady and deep. She traced the sharp line of his jaw with her fingertips, marveling at how peaceful he looked.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A text from Gregory.

"Emergency meeting at the office. Need you here ASAP."

Evelyn frowned. Gregory rarely sent urgent messages unless something was seriously wrong. She slipped out of bed carefully, not wanting to wake Nathaniel.

Downstairs, Alfred was already setting the breakfast table. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted warmly. "Would you like your usual coffee?"

"Yes, please," Evelyn replied absently, scrolling through her emails. One from Summit Realty caught her eye—a project proposal she hadn’t approved yet.

Alfred handed her the coffee, his expression concerned. "Is everything alright?"

"I’m not sure," she admitted. "Gregory called an emergency meeting. I need to head to the office early."

Just then, Nathaniel appeared at the doorway, his shirt half-buttoned, hair still tousled from sleep. "What’s going on?"

Evelyn sighed. "Work crisis. I have to go in."

He stepped closer, his fingers brushing her arm. "Do you want me to come with you?"

She shook her head. "No, it’s probably just a client issue. I’ll handle it."

Nathaniel studied her for a moment before nodding. "Call me if you need anything."

The drive to the office was tense. Evelyn’s mind raced with possibilities—had Summit Realty backed out? Had there been a design flaw?

When she arrived, Gregory was pacing in the conference room, his usually composed demeanor frayed at the edges.

"Thank God you’re here," he said, handing her a folder. "Look at this."

Evelyn flipped it open. Inside was a contract—one she’d never seen before—with her signature forged at the bottom.

Her stomach dropped. "What the hell is this?"

Gregory’s jaw tightened. "That’s what I’d like to know. Someone used your name to authorize a deal with Sebastian Wilson."

Sebastian Wilson. The name sent a chill down her spine. He was ruthless in business, known for underhanded tactics.

Evelyn clenched her fists. "We need to find out who did this."

Gregory nodded grimly. "And fast. Because if this goes through, we’re screwed."

Just then, her phone buzzed again. An unknown number.

"Looking forward to our partnership, Evelyn. - S.W."

Her blood ran cold.

This wasn’t just a mistake.

It was a trap.

His piercing gaze narrowed slightly in warning, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn met his eyes calmly. "I haven't had the chance to tell him yet."

"Was it truly a matter of time, or did you simply not want him to know you're married?"

"Nathaniel, even if I tell Adrian about us, he's right about one thing. You're not my boyfriend."

"Then what am I?"

"You're my husband."

The husband who didn't love her. The one who wanted a divorce. The man in love with someone else.

Yet they were still legally bound, still husband and wife.

Her answer came naturally, and Nathaniel's lips curled into a satisfied smirk. "Good. Then go tell him about us. And cancel that dinner."

"Now isn't the right time."

"When is the right time? Were you ever planning to tell him? Did he call you spoiled? By whom—him?"

His tone was sharp, his displeasure evident as he glared at her.

Evelyn blinked, taken aback by his sudden shift in mood.

"What are you implying?"

"Nothing. I just think discussing this in someone else's home is inappropriate."

She lowered her gaze, refusing to meet his eyes.

"Or is it that you don’t want to discuss it?"

His voice dropped dangerously. In one swift motion, he lifted her onto the counter, blocking her escape.

Evelyn exhaled shakily. "If you've already decided I'm hiding it, why ask?"

"Are you?"

"If that's what you—"

Before she could finish, he closed the distance between them.

Her breath hitched as his lips claimed hers, fierce and possessive.

Panic flared—anyone could walk in. She shoved against his chest. "Are you insane? Someone could see us!"

"Afraid people will find out you're married to me?"

"It's not fear. We're getting divorced. What's the point in announcing a failed marriage? Nathaniel, you have Isabella. Why are you doing this? Are you jealous?"

A bitter laugh escaped her. She'd asked before, always receiving the same answer—his concern stemmed from obligation, not affection.

But this time, Nathaniel didn't deny it.

His fingers tightened around her waist as he murmured against her lips, "Yes. I am. So behave. Stay away from Gregory and Adrian. And don’t forget who your husband is."

Evelyn froze.

Had she heard correctly?

His jealousy shouldn’t exist—not for her.

Yet before she could process it, he kissed her again, softer now, almost tender.

Lost in the moment, neither noticed Isabella lurking outside the door, her fists clenched in silent fury.

The words "I'm jealous" echoed in her mind, twisting like a knife.

Nathaniel had promised to marry her. She wouldn’t let Evelyn steal him away.

With a final glare, Isabella slipped away, her mind already plotting revenge.

The kiss lasted minutes, leaving Evelyn breathless.

Nathaniel nipped at her ear, his voice rough. "Remember what I said, Evelyn."

Her pulse raced, her cheeks burning.

She couldn’t respond, his words looping in her mind like a spell.

The rest of the evening passed in a daze.

Later, driving Adrian back to his hotel, silence stretched between them.

Adrian, slightly tipsy, finally broke it. "Aren’t you going to explain what happened tonight?"

Evelyn kept her eyes on the road. "Explain what?"

"Don’t play dumb. We lived together for years—I know you. What’s going on with Nathaniel?"

Her grip tightened on the wheel. She’d planned to tell him eventually, but not like this.

After a pause, she whispered, "We’ve been married for a year."

Adrian didn’t react.

"But we’ll probably divorce soon," she added.

His brow furrowed. "Because of Isabella?"

"It doesn’t matter why."

"Do you love him?"

Her silence was answer enough.

Finally, she said, "No one knows about the marriage. Keep it that way?"

Adrian nodded.

The quiet returned, heavy with unspoken thoughts.

Evelyn’s mind churned. Nathaniel’s jealousy—was it possessiveness? Or something more?

Impossible.

She shut down the hope before it could take root.

Then Adrian spoke again. "Nathaniel and Isabella dated a year ago, didn’t they? But I never sensed real love between them. I never thought he’d actually marry her."

Evelyn’s head snapped toward him.

"Why do you say that?"

Curiosity burned in her chest.

###Chapter 96

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden streaks across her blueprints. She tapped her pen against the desk, lost in thought. The Pineview Villa project was nearing completion, but something felt off.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel.

"Meeting at Martin Group HQ in an hour. Wear something impressive."

Evelyn arched a brow. Impressive? That was vague, even for him. She sighed and pushed back from her desk. Whatever it was, she’d play along—for now.

The Martin Group’s boardroom was packed when Evelyn arrived. Executives murmured in hushed tones, their eyes flickering toward her as she entered. Nathaniel stood at the head of the table, his expression unreadable.

"Ah, Evelyn. Perfect timing." His voice was smooth, but there was an edge to it.

She took her seat beside Gregory, who leaned in. "You have any idea what this is about?"

"None," she muttered.

Nathaniel cleared his throat. "As you all know, the Pineview project is nearly finished. But we’ve hit a snag." He tapped a button on the remote, and the screen behind him lit up with a series of documents.

Evelyn’s stomach dropped.

Those were her designs—but altered. Key structural elements had been changed, compromising the integrity of the entire project.

"These modifications were unauthorized," Nathaniel continued, his gaze locking onto hers. "And they’ve already been implemented."

A murmur rippled through the room. Evelyn’s fingers curled into fists.

"That’s impossible," she said, standing. "I never approved these changes."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Then explain how they ended up in the final blueprints."

Silence.

Evelyn scanned the faces around her—some curious, others smug. Someone had sabotaged her work. And the worst part? Nathaniel didn’t seem to believe her.

Gregory placed a hand on her arm. "We’ll figure this out."

But Evelyn barely heard him. Her mind raced.

Who would do this?

And why?

The meeting ended in tense silence. Evelyn stormed out, Nathaniel hot on her heels.

"Evelyn, wait—"

She whirled around. "You think I’d risk my reputation like this?"

His expression darkened. "I didn’t say that."

"Then what are you saying?"

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "I’m saying we need to find out who did this—before the media gets wind of it."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Fine. But I’m handling this my way."

She turned and walked away before he could respond.

Because one thing was clear—someone was playing games.

And Evelyn wasn’t about to lose.

Nathaniel smirked faintly, his voice low. "No reason. Just a man's intuition."

Evelyn arched a brow. "You've never been in love. How would you know what it feels like?"

"Nathaniel, are you questioning my judgment as a man?" he countered.

"I'm not questioning your judgment. I just didn't think you could read Nathaniel's mind," she shot back.

"Have you forgotten what I studied in college?"

His tone was light, but Evelyn fell silent.

Because she remembered—Nathaniel had majored in psychology.

He studied her for a moment before speaking again. "Is Isabella really the only reason you two divorced?"

"He promised to marry her," Evelyn replied flatly.

"That's it?"

Her expression darkened, voice turning icy. "Isn't that enough? If someone wants to marry another person without hesitation, doesn't that mean love?"

"That's your perspective. Love isn't the only reason a man marries. Duty, ambition—those can play a role too."

His words left Evelyn puzzled. How could there be duty without love?

And ambition—what kind of ambition could that be?

She merely smiled and said nothing.

Nathaniel didn’t press further. Matters of love and marriage were best understood by those involved.

"Come upstairs with me," he said instead. "Edward asked me to bring you gifts. My mother also baked your favorite cookies. I didn’t want to carry them on the plane, so I had them shipped to the hotel. They arrived this afternoon."

"They're so thoughtful. Meanwhile, you didn’t even get me anything. And now I have to chauffeur you around. It’s depressing."

"Are you complaining about me?"

"Be nice, or Edward might kick you out again."

Evelyn scoffed, pushing open the car door and following Nathaniel into the hotel.

To avoid misunderstandings, she didn’t step inside his room. She lingered at the doorway. "Just hand me the stuff. I won’t come in."

Nathaniel frowned.

"It’s late. If we’re photographed, it’ll be trouble. I am married, you know."

"Fine. Wait here."

He gave her a look before disappearing inside, returning moments later with a gift bag. "Here. Now hurry home, Mrs. Martin."

"Rest well. Dinner tomorrow?"

"Haven’t we already eaten?"

"He wants to invite you."

She met his gaze, explaining.

Nathaniel’s lips curled. "Why? In what capacity? As your husband?"

Evelyn didn’t answer, just stared.

He chuckled. "Then what’s my role? Family?"

"Are you coming or not?" she asked flatly.

"Of course. If Mr. Martin is inviting me, how could I refuse? Tell him to pick me up."

Evelyn didn’t respond, only giving him a look. "Do your fans know you’re like this in private?"

The Nathaniel the public knew was nothing like the man before her.

Without waiting for a reply, she turned and left.

Watching her retreat, Nathaniel called out, "Drive safe."

He didn’t close the door until the elevator swallowed her from view.

Back at Pineview Villa, Nathaniel had already returned. She handed the gifts to a servant. "Nathaniel, I told Nathaniel about dinner. He agreed. Should we host here or go out?"

"What do you think?"

His gaze pinned her.

Evelyn considered it. "If you don’t want outsiders in your home, we’ll arrange it outside."

Her words pleased him. A rare smile touched his lips.

He stepped closer, voice dropping. "You know me so well. You care that I don’t like strangers in my space. Let’s eat out."

Evelyn blinked, confused.

Nathaniel said nothing more. If he had, she might’ve questioned if this was really him.

Staring at him, she reached one conclusion:

He was probably trying to make up for the divorce. After all, a second marriage wasn’t ideal for a woman’s reputation.

The next morning, Evelyn was jolted awake by Nathaniel’s phone before her alarm.

Samuel was calling.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened the second he answered.

He sat up, voice sharp. "Take it down. Now."

Evelyn, now fully awake at his tone, asked softly, "What’s wrong?"

He didn’t answer immediately, jaw tight.

Then her phone rang.

She glanced at Nathaniel before answering. "Hello?"

"Evelyn, you and Nathaniel are trending. Someone leaked a video of you two at the hotel last night, plus photos of you together these past few days. The internet thinks you’re his girlfriend."

Gregory’s voice was tense.

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. She looked at Nathaniel—now she understood his call.

"I see," she said quietly.

"His older fans aren’t taking it well. Stay away from the office for now. It might not be safe."

"Okay."

"Should I contact Nathaniel for a statement?"

"Let me talk to him first."

Her voice was low. She needed to end this call.

"Evelyn, it’s just a misunderstanding. Clarify it, and it’ll blow over. I’m here for you."

Gregory’s reassurance barely registered before she hung up.

Setting her phone down, she faced Nathaniel calmly. "I only went to the hotel to get gifts from his parents. I didn’t even step inside his room. If you don’t believe me, check the hotel surveillance."

She’d been careful—yet they’d still been caught.

It wasn’t that she cared for herself. She didn’t want to drag Nathaniel into this. His fans had been waiting for his return. He was an icon. She wouldn’t tarnish that.

Nathaniel’s voice was ice. "Contact Nathaniel. Have him clarify you’ve been friends for years."

Before she could respond, his phone rang again.

He answered curtly. "Speak."

###Chapter 97

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, she felt the weight of countless eyes on her. The air was thick with tension, the kind that made her fingers curl instinctively into her palms. She had known this confrontation was inevitable, yet nothing could have prepared her for the storm brewing in Nathaniel’s darkened gaze.

"Evelyn," Nathaniel’s voice was low, controlled, but the undercurrent of anger was unmistakable. "We need to talk."

She lifted her chin, refusing to let her nerves show. "About what, Nathaniel? The fact that you’ve been keeping secrets from me? Or the sudden reappearance of Isabella in our lives?"

His jaw tightened at the mention of his ex-lover’s name. "It’s not what you think."

"Isn’t it?" Evelyn let out a bitter laugh. "Because from where I’m standing, it looks like history is repeating itself."

The silence that followed was suffocating. The opulent chandeliers above cast flickering shadows across the marble floor, mirroring the turmoil inside her. She had trusted him—had believed in the love they’d built—but now, doubt gnawed at her like a relentless beast.

Before Nathaniel could respond, the sharp click of heels echoed through the hall. Isabella strode in, her crimson dress a stark contrast to the muted tones of the room. Her lips curved into a knowing smile as she glanced between them.

"Am I interrupting something?" she purred.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. She had seen that look before—the same one Isabella had worn years ago when she’d effortlessly torn them apart.

Nathaniel’s expression hardened. "Isabella, this isn’t the time."

"Oh, but I think it is," Isabella countered, her gaze locking onto Evelyn’s. "After all, secrets have a way of coming out, don’t they?"

Evelyn’s breath hitched. What does she know?

The tension in the room was a live wire, ready to snap. And as Nathaniel stepped forward, his voice dropping to a whisper meant only for her, Evelyn realized one thing with chilling certainty:

This wasn’t just about the past.

"Mr. Martin, this situation is escalating. It's no longer just about the rumors between Mr. Whitman and Mrs. Martin. Someone has posted allegations that Mrs. Martin was unfaithful during their relationship. Several accounts are backing these claims with supposed evidence."

Evelyn heard Nathaniel's secretary, Samuel, deliver the report.

She turned to Nathaniel, her expression unreadable. Silence stretched between them like a taut wire.

Part of her wanted to explain—to insist she had never betrayed him. But the words died before they could form.

Distrust had always been their shadow. If he wouldn’t believe her now, no amount of pleading would change that.

Her silence made Nathaniel’s brow furrow. His voice was softer than she expected when he finally spoke. "Don’t you have anything to say?"

She met his gaze. "Would you believe me if I did?"

Their eyes locked, stubbornness mirrored in both.

The scandal had erupted too suddenly, spreading like wildfire. Someone was pulling strings behind the scenes.

Nathaniel didn’t linger in bed. He washed up quickly and disappeared into his study, the door shutting firmly behind him.

Evelyn stayed behind, her mood heavy.

The Martin family called—Edward, Victoria, and Richard—all voicing their support. "Evelyn, we stand with you," Edward said firmly. "We know you. These accusations are baseless."

Their faith warmed her, but it couldn’t lift the weight in her chest.

Her gaze drifted to the closed study door. A dull ache settled in her ribs.

Truthfully, public opinion didn’t frighten her. She knew her innocence. What others thought had never mattered.

She checked the time and called Isaac.

He was notorious for turning off his phone at night, so it took until morning to reach him.

The call connected quickly. She summarized the situation, then added, "There are probably reporters swarming your hotel. Stay inside today."

Isaac, still groggy, processed her words before responding. "What do you need me to do?"

"Nothing."

"Nothing?"

"Exactly. This isn’t something a simple clarification will fix. Let’s wait and see what else unfolds."

She wanted to uncover what—or who—was lurking in the shadows.

Though Isaac disagreed, he assumed it was Nathaniel’s strategy and reluctantly agreed.

Evelyn scrolled through Twitter and forums. The comments were brutal—a flood of condemnation and vitriol. The world had already convicted her.

This was the cruelty of the internet.

She exhaled sharply, the bitterness lingering.

After washing up, she forced down a light breakfast before carrying Nathaniel’s upstairs.

She hesitated outside the study, her hand hovering over the knob.

Then his voice cut through the door. "I don’t care if she agrees. Proceed as planned. It’s time the public knew."

His words sent a jolt through her.

What was he revealing?

Who was "she"?

Was it her?

Her lips pressed into a thin line. The courage to enter evaporated.

She retreated downstairs, feigning calm as she sank onto the living room sofa, lost in thought.

Her phone buzzed incessantly with unknown numbers. She knew what they wanted. With a sigh, she powered it off.

The morning passed in stifling silence, the house divided.

Meanwhile, Twitter exploded.

The Martin Group’s official account pinned a post at the top of its feed: [No more hiding. Mr. and Mrs. Martin—happiness forever.]

Below it was a photo.

A stunning woman beside a devastatingly handsome man.

The post went viral instantly, shredding the rumors to pieces.

A second tweet followed: [The Martin Group’s legal team will pursue all accounts spreading defamatory rumors. We urge everyone to cease speculation. Congratulations to Mr. and Mrs. Martin.]

Reactions flooded in:

[Wait—THAT’S Mrs. Martin?!]

[What kind of plot twist is this?!]

[So she’s not some cheating gold-digger? She’s his WIFE?]

[But what about Isabella? She’s been hinting she’s with Nathaniel this whole time!]

[Isabella’s got some explaining to do…]

The official confirmation left no room for doubt.

Five minutes before the Martin Group’s post, Isaac received a call.

Samuel’s polite voice came through. "Mr. Whitman, regarding the rumors—Mr. Martin has a request. Would you be willing to assist?"

Isaac, already briefed by Evelyn, wasn’t bothered. "Go on."

"Mr. Martin intends to publicly confirm his marital status. He hopes you’ll help clarify your relationship with Evelyn."

A slow smile curved Isaac’s lips. "He’s announcing their marriage?"

"Yes."

"Fine. For Evelyn’s sake, I’ll cooperate."

Within minutes, Isaac posted on his long-dormant Twitter:

[Evelyn and I met in high school. My father was her teacher. She lived with us until graduation. We’ve remained close since—like family. To my fans: don’t believe the lies. Thank you.]

The message was clear.

His followers rushed to apologize to Evelyn, spawning the hashtag #SorryEvelyn.

Some questioned why she’d lived with Isaac’s family if she was a Mitchell, but those comments drowned in the tide of support.

Many declared her life goals: a husband like Nathaniel and a friend like Isaac.

The crisis had dissolved.

But Evelyn didn’t know yet.

Nathaniel descended the stairs, finding her still on the sofa, staring blankly ahead.

"What are you doing?" he asked.

She blinked, returning to the present. "Thinking."

His frown softened, the morning light catching the warmth in his eyes. "Have you checked Twitter today?"
###Chapter 98

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew across the keyboard as she finalized the blueprints for the new Martin Group project. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint aroma of lavender from the diffuser in the corner.

A sharp knock interrupted her concentration. "Come in," she called without looking up.

Gabrielle, her assistant, entered with a tablet in hand. "Ms. Mitchell, Mr. Wilson is here to see you. He says it's urgent."

Evelyn's fingers stilled. Gregory never visited without an appointment. "Send him in."

Gregory strode in moments later, his usually composed face tight with tension. He closed the door firmly behind him. "We have a problem," he said without preamble. "The zoning permits for the waterfront development just got rejected."

"What?" Evelyn's chair scraped against the hardwood as she stood abruptly. "That's impossible. We had all the approvals in place."

Gregory ran a hand through his salt-and-pepper hair. "Apparently there were last-minute objections from the environmental committee. Someone tipped them off about potential wetland disturbances."

Evelyn's mind raced. This project was crucial - not just for their firm, but for Nathaniel's reputation at Martin Group. She reached for her phone. "I need to call Nathaniel."

"Wait." Gregory's hand hovered over hers. "There's more. I just got off the phone with Jonathan Blake from Summit Realty. He mentioned seeing Isabella Davis having lunch with Sebastian Wilson yesterday."

The air left Evelyn's lungs. Sebastian Wilson - Edward's biggest business rival. And Isabella... Nathaniel's ex who'd made no secret of wanting him back. This couldn't be a coincidence.

Her phone buzzed with an incoming call. An unknown number. With trembling fingers, she answered. "Hello?"

"Evelyn Mitchell?" A smooth female voice purred through the line. "We need to talk. About your husband... and the rather interesting documents that just landed in my possession. Meet me at The Velvet Lounge in an hour. Come alone."

The line went dead before Evelyn could respond. She stared at the phone, her pulse pounding in her ears.

Gregory's brow furrowed. "Who was that?"

Evelyn swallowed hard, her mouth suddenly dry. "I think... I think it was Vanessa. Isabella's agent."

The office seemed to tilt around her. Whatever game was being played, the stakes had just gotten dangerously high. And Evelyn had the sinking feeling she was being maneuvered into checkmate.

Evelyn assumed he was talking about the scandalous rumors, so she nodded. "Yes, I saw them."

"You have nothing to say to me?"

His expression was tense. The Martin Group had released two official statements. Why was she so indifferent?

Evelyn met his gaze steadily. "I never did any of those things. Whether you believe me or not, I—"

"You think I’m asking about the rumors?" Nathaniel’s deep voice cut her off.

"Then what?"

Nathaniel let out a low chuckle. "So you haven’t seen the announcement?"

Evelyn frowned, confused.

Nathaniel picked up his phone, pulled up Instagram, and handed it to her. When she saw the Martin Group’s post confirming their marriage, her breath hitched.

She stared at the screen, frozen.

Nathaniel took his phone back. "Anything to say now?"

"You announced our marriage?"

"Obviously."

"But what about Isabella? And we’re supposed to be getting divorced soon, aren’t we?"

"Evelyn," Nathaniel said, his voice edged with frustration, "you really have a talent for worrying about everyone but yourself. You should be relieved this mess is over. For once, think about yourself."

Her lack of enthusiasm darkened his expression.

Evelyn just frowned at him. It wasn’t that she cared about Isabella—she just didn’t see the point in revealing their marriage when it was ending anyway.

Given time, the scandal would fade.

But Nathaniel’s actions stirred something in her. He had defended her publicly, silencing the rumors. It was unexpected.

Before Evelyn could respond, Nathaniel’s phone rang. Martin Group stocks had surged after his marital status was confirmed. He needed to attend an emergency meeting.

Before leaving, he glanced at her. "Evelyn, when I get back tonight, I hope you’ll understand why I did this. And don’t mention that word again."

That word.

Divorce.

She watched him walk away, her thoughts tangled.

Evelyn was always logical, but Nathaniel’s actions left her uncertain.

A thought flickered in her mind.

Did he do this because he doesn’t want a divorce?

No.

She shook her head. "Impossible."

Not only did Evelyn struggle to believe it, but Isabella would never accept it either.

Meanwhile, Isabella was in chaos. Fans who had shared her posts were demanding explanations.

Vanessa, her agent, asked, "Isabella, how do we respond? The studio’s phone hasn’t stopped ringing. Sponsors want answers."

Public scrutiny was ruthless. Even if the scandal faded, the internet never forgot.

Isabella sat stiffly, her face blank. Since seeing the marriage announcement, she had been numb.

"Just have someone impersonate me online," she said flatly. "My account isn’t under my real name."

"That’s all we can do. But why would Nathaniel reveal his marriage now? Did the Martin family pressure him because of Evelyn’s scandal?"

Isabella stayed silent.

The announcement required Nathaniel’s approval. No one could force him.

Her chest ached with frustration.

She pulled the blanket over her head, unwilling to speak. Only when Vanessa left did she grab her phone and dial.

"Why did it turn out like this? I wanted rumors about Evelyn and Isaac, not a marriage announcement!"

"Blame yourself. Those rumors spread because of you. Now that they’ve gone public, it’ll be even harder for you to get close to him. At least now you know where you stand."

"But—"

"Enough. Focus on damage control. When this dies down, find a way to drive them apart."

The cold voice on the other end gave her a sliver of confidence.

Meanwhile, the Martin family was celebrating.

Edward called Nathaniel. "Bring Evelyn for dinner tonight. Your mother’s cooking."

Nathaniel smirked. "You’re in a good mood."

Edward huffed. "You should’ve done this sooner. Maybe then I wouldn’t have to nag you."

"Grandpa, am I really part of this family?"

"Not if you don’t treat Evelyn right," Edward teased before turning serious. "Come early. I have big news tonight."

"What is it?"

Edward chuckled. "Patience. You’ll find out soon enough. Consider it your reward."

"My reward?" Nathaniel echoed.

###Chapter 99

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Pineview Villa, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. Evelyn stretched beneath the silk sheets, her fingers brushing against the cold, empty space where Nathaniel should have been. Again.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory flashed on the screen: "Emergency meeting at 9. Summit Realty changed the blueprints again."

Evelyn groaned, rubbing her temples. The Summit project had been nothing but trouble since Sebastian Wilson took over. She could already feel the beginnings of a migraine forming.

Downstairs, Alfred was setting breakfast on the terrace. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted with his usual impeccable timing. "Mr. Martin left early for the office. He asked me to inform you he'll be attending the charity gala tonight without you."

Evelyn's fork hovered mid-air. "Again?" Her voice came out sharper than intended.

Alfred's expression remained neutral. "He mentioned urgent business with Mr. Yates."

The toast turned to ash in her mouth. Samuel Yates. Nathaniel's ever-present shadow. Lately, it seemed her husband spent more time with his secretary than with her.

Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was Charlotte: "Saw the photos from last night's event. Isabella looked particularly cozy with Nathaniel. You okay?"

Evelyn's thumb hovered over the screen. The familiar ache in her chest intensified. Isabella Davis - Nathaniel's first love, the woman who still haunted their marriage like a persistent ghost.

She was about to reply when another notification popped up - an email from Summit Realty's project manager, Jonathan Blake. The subject line made her blood run cold: "Immediate Revisions Required - Client's Personal Request."

Opening the attachment, Evelyn's breath caught. The architectural renderings had been altered beyond recognition. Worse still, the revision notes bore Edward Martin's personal signature. Her father-in-law had interfered again.

The terrace doors slid open suddenly. Nathaniel stood there, his tie already loosened despite the early hour. "Change of plans," he said without preamble. "We're both attending the gala tonight. Grandfather's orders."

Evelyn studied his face - the tightness around his eyes, the barely concealed tension in his jaw. "What aren't you telling me?"

Nathaniel's phone rang before he could answer. The way his entire demeanor changed when he saw the caller ID told Evelyn everything she needed to know.

"Take it," she said coolly, rising from the table. "I have a company to run and blueprints to salvage. Again."

As she walked away, she heard Nathaniel's hushed "Isabella?" followed by the terrace doors closing behind her. The sound might as well have been a gunshot.

Upstairs in her study, Evelyn stared at the Summit blueprints. The revisions weren't just impractical - they were impossible. Just like her marriage.

Her computer pinged with a calendar reminder: "Dr. Harrison - Annual Physical - 2 PM." Right. The Martin family physician's mandatory checkup. Another obligation in this gilded cage.

Evelyn opened her bottom desk drawer, fingers brushing against the unopened pregnancy test hidden beneath her files. Three days late. Probably just stress.

She jumped when her office phone rang. It was Gabrielle, her assistant. "Mrs. Martin? Mr. Wilson is here with the Summit clients. They're demanding to see you immediately."

Evelyn took a steadying breath. "Tell them I'll be right down."

As she straightened her blazer, her reflection in the mirror caught her eye. The perfect society wife. The accomplished architect. The woman whose husband was still in love with someone else.

The clock on the wall ticked ominously. 9:15 AM. Twelve hours until the gala. Twelve hours until she'd have to watch Nathaniel and Isabella together again.

Evelyn squared her shoulders. First, she'd handle Summit Realty. Then Dr. Harrison. Then tonight's performance. One mask at a time.

But Nathaniel remained silent.
He knew Evelyn was sharp. She probably had pieced together part of the truth. Nathaniel intended to consult Edward first—he always valued his grandfather's counsel.

Evelyn didn’t press further. She assumed Nathaniel was pleased and wanted to commend her.

After hanging up, she leaned back in her plush office chair, eyes half-lidded. Nathaniel’s stunned expression flashed through her mind—the moment he’d publicly declared their marriage.

She never expected him to do it.

A wry smile tugged at Evelyn’s lips. What does he even think of me?

Her reaction hadn’t been the joy he’d anticipated. Was she worried her ex would find out?

The thought darkened her gaze.

7:00 PM. Martin Manor.

Before stepping inside, laughter already spilled from the grand foyer. Evelyn’s radiant smile greeted him as she murmured, "Grandfather, your happiness means everything to me."

Edward beamed. "It’s seeing you and Nathaniel together that brings me joy. Our family’s harmony grows stronger."

Richard nodded in agreement while Victoria bustled in the kitchen—a rare sight.

For the first time, Nathaniel felt genuine warmth here. No schemes, no tension—just simple, unguarded affection.

He arched a brow, envisioning a future bathed in this light.

"Mr. Martin! You’re here." Victoria emerged with a fruit platter.

Edward waved him over with an uncharacteristic grin. "Sit."

As Nathaniel approached, Edward poured him coffee.

"Since when do you spoil me, Grandfather?"

"Don’t flatter yourself. You’ve merely done one thing right."

"Should I thank Evelyn, then?"

"Obviously." Edward’s chuckle was met with Nathaniel’s smirk as their eyes locked onto the quiet woman beside them. Electricity crackled in the space between.

Evelyn caught the unspoken question in his obsidian gaze: Figured it out yet?

She quickly looked away.

Nathaniel’s voice dripped honeyed venom. "Grandfather, I’m grateful. But Evelyn seems... displeased about the announcement. She hasn’t spoken to me all evening."

Evelyn’s head snapped up. In their year of marriage, he’d been nothing but considerate—yet now, he felt like a stranger.

He tilted his head, confidence oozing.

"Grandfather, I—" she began.

"If she’s ignoring you, reflect on your actions," Edward cut in. "Evelyn’s kindness is boundless. If she’s upset, you provoked it."

The blatant favoritism made Nathaniel laugh. "Your bias is showing."

"I simply trust her judgment."

"Should I leave, then?" His self-deprecating tone drew chuckles from Richard and Victoria.

Victoria turned to Evelyn. "You didn’t want the marriage public?"

Evelyn’s smile was tight. "It was just... sudden. I need time to adjust."

"You’ll adapt," Victoria gushed. "Darling, you wouldn’t believe the messages I’ve received! Everyone admires our family for having you."

Her adoring gaze made Evelyn’s cheeks warm.

Dinner passed without incident. As Nathaniel prepared to return to Pineview Villa, he cornered Edward.

"My surprise?"

Edward’s gaze flicked to Evelyn. "Patience. You haven’t earned it yet."

Nathaniel frowned, then shot Evelyn a questioning look.

"Take her home," Edward deflected, retreating upstairs.

The car ride was thick with silence. Halfway home, Nathaniel finally spoke, voice low.

"What did Grandfather tell you? About this surprise?"

Evelyn stiffened. The secret—their child—burned on her tongue. But revealing it would chain them forever.

Could she condemn herself to a loveless marriage? Condemn her child to that life?

No. Some surprises were better left unshared.
###Chapter 100

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. She stood by the window, sipping her coffee, her mind racing with the events of last night. Nathaniel had proposed—again. But this time, it felt different.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Gregory. "Meeting in 30. The investors are waiting."

Evelyn sighed. She wasn't ready to face the world yet. Not after the emotional whirlwind Nathaniel had thrown her into. But duty called.

She dressed quickly, opting for a sleek navy pantsuit—her armor. As she stepped into the elevator, her reflection stared back at her. "What are you doing, Evelyn?" she muttered.

The lobby was bustling. The doorman tipped his hat. "Morning, Ms. Mitchell."

"Morning, Alfred," she replied absently, stepping into the waiting car.

The ride to the office was a blur. Her thoughts kept drifting back to Nathaniel's words. "I never stopped loving you."

The car stopped. She took a deep breath.

Gregory was waiting at the entrance, his usual composed self. "You're late."

"Traffic," she lied.

He raised an eyebrow but said nothing.

The meeting room was packed. Investors, board members—all eyes turned to her as she entered.

"Ah, Ms. Mitchell. We were just discussing the new project," said Jonathan Blake, Summit Realty's project manager.

Evelyn forced a smile. "Perfect timing, then."

She launched into her presentation, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. The numbers, the projections—all flawless. But her mind was elsewhere.

Halfway through, her phone vibrated. A message from Nathaniel. "We need to talk."

Her heart skipped a beat.

Gregory noticed her hesitation. "Everything alright?"

"Fine," she said, locking her phone. "Let's proceed."

The meeting dragged on. Questions, debates, more questions. Evelyn answered mechanically, her thoughts a tangled mess.

Finally, it was over.

Gregory cornered her outside. "What's going on with you today?"

"Nothing. Just tired."

He studied her face. "This isn't just fatigue. Is it Nathaniel?"

Evelyn looked away. "It's complicated."

"Complicated?" He scoffed. "You've been dancing around this for years."

She clenched her fists. "I don't need a lecture, Gregory."

"Fine. But don't let it ruin what we've built."

She watched him walk away, guilt gnawing at her.

Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was Charlotte. "Emergency girls' night. My place. 8 PM."

Evelyn smiled faintly. Some things never changed.

She texted back. "I'll be there."

As she stepped out of the building, the city buzzed around her. The noise, the chaos—it mirrored her mind.

Nathaniel's words echoed. "I never stopped loving you."

Did she still love him?

The answer terrified her.

Because deep down, she already knew.

She always had.

Evelyn turned to face him. A fleeting emotion crossed her delicate features, but Nathaniel maintained his composed tone. "No."

"Are you certain?"

"Absolutely."

"Then what did you and Grandfather discuss?"

"He asked if I was happy."

Nathaniel's gaze flickered toward her, skepticism evident. "Well then, tell me—are you?"

The striking man was dressed in an immaculate black suit, his expression unreadable, his dark eyes intense.

Evelyn instinctively averted her gaze, looking out the window instead. "I'm more... surprised than happy."

His lips curled into a cold smirk. "Evelyn, Grandfather claims you're kind and considerate. So why don’t I see it? Or are you deliberately hiding that side from me?"

She froze for a heartbeat.

When she turned back, he had already closed his eyes, his face a mask of indifference, brows slightly furrowed.

Evelyn remained silent the entire ride back to Pineview Villa.

As the car halted, Nathaniel’s phone rang.

He answered in front of her. "What is it?"

"Drinks?"

"Where?"

The caller gave an address. Nathaniel glanced at Evelyn. "It’s still early. I’m heading to Thomas’s place. You should rest."

"Fine." She stepped out, watching the car reverse before retreating into the house.

Half an hour later, Nathaniel arrived at the private club.

Thomas and the others were already waiting. Thomas poured him a drink and announced, "Mr. Martin is covering the tab tonight."

The other two—Theodore and Maxwell—exchanged glances. They were all close friends.

The moment Nathaniel sat down, Thomas leaned in and whispered, "Nathaniel, what’s going on? Why the sudden announcement?"

"Not your concern." His tone was icy.

"We’re just looking out for you. Do you realize how many hearts you’ve broken? Especially Isabella’s. Was this your idea, or did Edward force you?"

Thomas already knew the answer. Nathaniel hadn’t been the same man he was a year ago. Now, he was untouchable—the face of the Martin empire.

Thomas pressed further. "Nathaniel, is this because you’ve cut ties with Isabella?"

A cold glance. "This has nothing to do with her."

"But you once said you’d marry her."

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened.

Thomas hesitated before asking, "So... you’re not planning to divorce Evelyn? You intend to stay married?"

"And if I do?"

"Then there’s no issue."

Thomas smirked. "Unless... you’ve fallen for her?"

Nathaniel’s expression remained impassive, but his gaze warned Thomas to back off.

Did love matter?

They’d been married for a year. They’d made it public. That was enough.

Theodore chimed in, "Thomas, stop prying. They’re husband and wife. It’s their business."

"If you have fallen for her, we support you."

Nathaniel arched a brow. "Since when do I need your approval?"

Thomas chuckled. "Nathaniel, if you’re serious about spending your life with Evelyn, have you ever considered her feelings?"

Would she even want that?

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened imperceptibly. He gave Thomas a dismissive glance before looking away, his face betraying nothing.

But the question lingered.

The prolonged silence made the trio exchange uneasy looks.

Thomas cleared his throat. "Forget I asked—"

"Does it matter?" Nathaniel finally spoke. "The marriage is public. Divorce isn’t an option. Grandfather wants an heir. We’ll give him one."

Thomas stiffened.

Was he planning to bind Evelyn to him with a child?

Nathaniel drank calmly, his expression unreadable.

A year of marriage. A public declaration. A child was the next logical step.

But he hadn’t mentioned this to Evelyn.

She had no idea.

Meanwhile, Evelyn’s life had shifted dramatically since the announcement.

The Mitchells were suddenly inundated with visitors—wealthier, more influential than they’d ever been.

"William Mitchell, you’ve kept this alliance with the Martins so quiet! We could learn a thing or two from your humility."

William smiled politely. "My daughter and Nathaniel chose each other. We don’t interfere."

"You’re fortunate to have a son-in-law like Mr. Martin."

William exchanged a worried glance with Margaret. Why had the Martins gone public now?

What if they divorced? Would that be announced too?

Evelyn arrived at work to uneasy stares.

Her colleagues hesitated, unsure whether to address her as Mrs. Martin.

She sighed. "I’m still Evelyn. Just act normal."

They relaxed, nodding.

She glanced at Gregory’s empty office. "Mr. Wilson isn’t in yet?"

###Chapter 101

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. She stood by the kitchen island, absently stirring her coffee while scrolling through emails on her phone. The aroma of freshly brewed espresso mingled with the crisp scent of lavender from the balcony garden.

A notification popped up—another message from Nathaniel. Her fingers hovered over the screen. Three weeks since their explosive argument, and he still texted daily. Persistent as always, she thought, though the corner of her mouth twitched upward. This one read: "Meeting with Edward at 2. He asked about you."

She exhaled sharply. Edward Martin’s inquiries were never casual. The patriarch of the Martin dynasty had a way of weaving questions like spider silk—delicate but inescapable. Setting the phone down, she traced the rim of her cup. The last family dinner had ended with shattered crystal and Isabella’s thinly veiled barbs about "failed commitments."

Her assistant Gabrielle buzzed in. "The contractor for the waterfront project is on line two. Also, Gregory’s here—says it’s urgent."

Evelyn’s spine straightened. Gregory never dropped by unannounced. She swiped the call to voicemail. "Send him up."

The elevator doors parted to reveal Gregory, his usually impeccable suit rumpled, a file clutched under one arm. "We have a problem," he said without preamble. "Summit Realty just filed an injunction against the Heritage Tower bid. Sebastian’s claiming design infringement."

Her nails dug into her palms. Sebastian Wilson. The name alone conjured images of boardroom ambushes and his smirk during last year’s zoning hearing. "On what grounds?"

"He’s citing the cantilevered lobby design. Says it’s identical to their unbuilt proposal for Dubai." Gregory tossed the folder onto the counter. Inside, side-by-side sketches bore unsettling similarities.

Evelyn’s breath hitched. She’d drafted those renderings alone, late nights when Nathaniel was overseas. Only one other person had access to her studio during that time—Isabella, who’d "stopped by for tea" the week before the Dubai bid.

Across the city, Nathaniel’s phone lit up with a calendar alert: Lunch with Isabella – Noon. The screen reflected his grimace. Vanessa’s latest email threatened to leak "compromising photos" unless he reconsidered sponsoring Isabella’s fashion line. He thumbed a reply: "We’ll discuss this face-to-face."

Alfred materialized at the study door. "Sir, Mr. Ellsworth is waiting downstairs. He mentioned something about... a missing contract?"

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. Thomas only dealt in one kind of contract—the sort that buried scandals. "Tell him five minutes."

As Alfred retreated, Nathaniel’s gaze fell on the framed photo atop his desk: Evelyn laughing on their Maldives honeymoon, sea foam curling around her ankles. The memory of her cold dismissal at the gala—"I’m done competing with ghosts"—clawed at him.

He pocketed his phone. Some battles couldn’t be won with lawyers or money.

Back at the penthouse, Evelyn stared at the blueprints, Gregory’s voice fading into static. The doorbell rang again. Through the peephole, Charlotte’s wide eyes met hers. "You need to see this," her friend hissed, thrusting forward a tabloid.

The headline screamed: "Martin Heir’s Secret Tryst with Ex—Photos Inside!" Below, a blurred but unmistakable image showed Nathaniel gripping Isabella’s wrist in a dimly lit corridor.

Evelyn’s vision tunneled. The timestamp read last night.

Somewhere in the city, a grandfather clock struck noon.

Gregory's assistant responded promptly, "Mr. Wilson called to say he has prior engagements today and won't be coming in."

"Understood." Evelyn nodded and stepped into her office.

She didn’t bother asking why Gregory wasn’t present. She already had her suspicions.

Evelyn settled into her chair just as Gabrielle entered, clutching a stack of documents. "Ms. Mitchell, here’s the report I prepared yesterday."

"Leave it there. I’ll review it later."

Gabrielle hesitated, shifting her weight from one foot to the other.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Something else?"

"Well… I was just curious—"

"Go ahead."

"Can I really ask?"

"You have exactly one chance," Evelyn replied coolly.

Gabrielle blurted, "Ms. Mitchell, is it true you and Mr. Martin are married?"

Evelyn studied her assistant’s eager expression. "Do you think the marriage certificate was forged? Would the Martin Group publicly announce a lie?"

"So it is real!" Gabrielle’s eyes sparkled. "You two are perfect together!" She leaned in conspiratorially. "Was it because of you that Mr. Martin and Mr. Wilson fought last time?"

"No."

"Really? Everyone at the office always assumed you’d end up with Mr. Wilson."

The words slipped out before Gabrielle could stop them.

Evelyn’s gaze sharpened as she flipped open the file. "By 'everyone,' you mean you?"

"Of course not! It’s obvious Mr. Wilson has feelings for you," Gabrielle insisted.

Evelyn’s tone turned icy. "I hired you to discuss my personal life? If gossip is your priority over work, consider this a warning. Inform the team they’re each docked $500 this month."

"Five hundred?!" Gabrielle paled.

"Make it a thousand if you say another word."

Gabrielle clamped her mouth shut, barely daring to exhale.

With a dismissive wave, Evelyn sent her out. The pay cut was an empty threat, but the message was clear.

Alone, Evelyn slumped back, resting a hand on her rounded stomach. What now, little one?

The news of Nathaniel’s marriage had set Mayby’s elite circles ablaze. Though Twitter chatter had waned, high society still buzzed with speculation.

In a hotel restroom, a cluster of socialites huddled by the sinks.

"Mr. Sinclair mentioned Mr. Martin wants an heir. That’s why he went public—Harper must already be pregnant. The Martins would never let a scandal tarnish their legacy."

"Exactly. Even if she’s beneath him, a child secures her position. We’d better tread carefully from now on. One wrong move, and our families could suffer."

Nods of agreement rippled through the group before they filed out, oblivious to the stall door creaking open in their wake.

A woman emerged, her flawless makeup at odds with the venom in her eyes. She gripped the sink, staring into the mirror.

Nathaniel wants a child with Evelyn?

Her knuckles whitened before she schooled her features into calm. Stepping into the hallway, she collided with a smirking Donovan Sinclair.

Forcing a smile, she purred, "Donovan! What a surprise. What brings you here?"
###Chapter 102

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the design—a new luxury resort project that had consumed her thoughts for weeks.

A soft knock interrupted her concentration. "Evelyn, you have a visitor," Gabrielle, her assistant, announced with a knowing smile.

Before Evelyn could respond, the door swung open, revealing Nathaniel. Dressed in a tailored navy suit, his presence filled the room with an undeniable energy. His dark eyes locked onto hers, sending a familiar warmth through her chest.

"I thought we could have lunch," he said, his voice smooth yet commanding.

Evelyn arched a brow. "You flew all the way here just for lunch?"

Nathaniel smirked. "Would you believe me if I said I missed you?"

She rolled her eyes but couldn't suppress the flutter in her stomach. "You're impossible."

He stepped closer, his fingers brushing against hers as he examined the blueprints. "This looks impressive. The Martin Group would be lucky to have you on board."

Evelyn hesitated. The offer had been on the table for weeks—a high-profile collaboration between her firm and the Martin Group. But working directly under Nathaniel? That was a complication she wasn’t sure she was ready for.

"I'm still considering it," she admitted.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened slightly. "Isabella called me last night."

The mention of his ex-girlfriend sent a sharp pang through Evelyn. She schooled her features into neutrality. "And?"

"She wants to meet. Says it's important."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "So, what are you going to do?"

Nathaniel exhaled, running a hand through his hair. "I don’t know. But I wanted you to hear it from me first."

The air between them thickened with unspoken tension. Evelyn bit her lip, weighing her next words carefully. Before she could respond, her phone buzzed—a message from Gregory.

Emergency meeting. Summit Realty just undercut our bid for the waterfront project.

Her stomach dropped. That project was supposed to be her firm’s breakthrough.

Nathaniel noticed the shift in her expression. "What's wrong?"

Evelyn grabbed her blazer. "I have to go. Something just came up."

He caught her wrist. "Let me help."

She met his gaze, torn between professional pride and the undeniable pull between them. "This is my battle, Nathaniel."

His grip tightened slightly before he released her. "Fine. But remember—you don’t have to fight alone."

As Evelyn rushed out, her mind raced. Between Isabella’s sudden reappearance and Summit Realty’s sabotage, the day had taken an unexpected turn.

And she had a sinking feeling things were about to get much worse.

Donovan Sinclair stood before her, his lips curling into a faint smirk. "Isabella, I came here specifically for you. I've asked you out repeatedly, but you always claim to be occupied. You reject my advances and now refuse even my friendship?"

Isabella offered him a practiced smile. "Don't be ridiculous. People might misunderstand. You're the heir of the Sinclair family—who would dare reject you?"

"Isabella, you never change. First, you push me away, then you pull me back. How am I supposed to move on?"

Donovan's smile remained, but his gaze never wavered from her face. Handsome, yes, but beneath that charm lay something darker—calculating, manipulative.

Keeping her expression composed, Isabella deftly shifted the conversation. "Donovan, is there something you need from me?"

"Nothing urgent. I just wanted to check on you. I’ve been... concerned."

The implication was clear, and Isabella caught it instantly.

Her eyes welled up, the smile slipping from her delicate features. She looked wounded, the kind of fragile beauty that made men ache to protect her. "I'm fine," she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. "Truly."

"Nathaniel is humiliating you with this arrangement," Donovan pressed. "Isabella, why cling to him? He’s already promised Edward and Thomas he won’t divorce Evelyn. Worse—he’s planning to have a child with her."

"Planning doesn’t mean she’s pregnant yet, does it?"

The realization struck Isabella like lightning, but she betrayed nothing. Instead, she bit her lower lip, her voice trembling. "Donovan, I know you mean well. I know my presence caused the rift between you and Nathaniel. This is all my fault."

Tears spilled over as she spoke. Donovan immediately softened, reaching for her. "Isabella, how could I blame you? If anything, it’s my fault for not finding you sooner. Had I met you first, things would be different."

She pressed her lips together, silent sobs shaking her shoulders. The sight shattered Donovan’s resolve. Unable to bear her distress, he reluctantly stepped back.

Once he was gone, Isabella wiped her tears and strode to her car in the parking lot, her composure fully restored.

Inside, she dialed a number. "Evelyn, we need to talk. There’s something you deserve to know."

Evelyn’s response was dry. "Is this about your claim on Nathaniel? Save your breath. If you want to argue over our open marriage or remind me he loves you, not me, don’t bother. Take it up with him."

Isabella’s lips curled. "Evelyn, are you scared?"

"Your games won’t work on me. Whatever you have to say is irrelevant. I don’t care to hear it."

Just as Evelyn moved to hang up, Isabella’s voice turned urgent. "Evelyn, did Nathaniel ever tell you why I could never conceive?"

The line went silent.

Evelyn froze, her breath catching.

Infertility... because of Nathaniel?

Her mind reeled, but her voice remained steady. "And why should that matter to me?"

Isabella’s tone turned sly. "You don’t find it odd that he suddenly wants a child with you?"

###Chapter 103

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of our penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. I stretched beneath the silk sheets, my fingers brushing against Nathaniel's bare chest. His steady breathing told me he was still asleep, the stress lines from last night's board meeting finally smoothed away.

My phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. Gabrielle's name flashed across the screen with three urgent messages about the Montgomery project. I slipped out of bed carefully, not wanting to wake Nathaniel, and padded barefoot to the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city.

The view never failed to take my breath away. From our 80th-floor vantage point, Manhattan stretched before me like a living blueprint, each building a testament to someone's architectural dream. My fingers itched to sketch the skyline's ever-changing silhouette.

The shower turned on behind me. Through the frosted glass, I could see Nathaniel's muscular outline. My stomach did that familiar flip it always did when I watched him. Even after two years of marriage, the man could still make my pulse race.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin," his deep voice rumbled as he emerged, towel slung low on his hips. Water droplets clung to his dark hair, tracing paths down his sculpted torso. "You're up early."

"Work never sleeps," I quipped, accepting the steaming mug of coffee he handed me. The rich aroma of Ethiopian beans filled the space between us. "Gabrielle says the Montgomery clients want to move up the presentation."

Nathaniel's brow furrowed as he buttoned his dress shirt. "That's this Thursday, isn't it? Right before the gala." His fingers stilled on the third button. "You're not canceling on me again, are you?"

I opened my mouth to respond when his phone rang. The caller ID showed Samuel Yates. Nathaniel's expression darkened as he listened to whatever his secretary was saying.

"I'll be there in twenty," he said tersely before hanging up. "Isabella's back in town."

The coffee turned bitter in my mouth. Isabella Davis - Nathaniel's ex-fiancée and the woman who'd nearly destroyed our relationship two years ago. She'd disappeared to Paris after the scandal, leaving her modeling career in shambles.

"And?" I forced my voice to remain steady.

"And she's claiming she has information about my grandfather's will." Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Edward's been acting strange lately. I need to see what this is about."

I set down my mug with deliberate calm. "I'm coming with you."

The Martin Group headquarters loomed over Fifth Avenue like a modern fortress. The elevator ride to the executive floor was silent except for the soft hum of machinery. Samuel met us at the doors, his usually composed face strained.

"She's in the conference room with Vanessa," he murmured. "They're demanding to see the original will documents."

Nathaniel's hand found mine as we walked down the corridor. His grip was almost painfully tight. Through the glass walls, I could see Isabella lounging in a chair like she owned the place, her long legs crossed at the ankle. Vanessa stood behind her, tapping impatiently on an iPad.

The moment we entered, Isabella's crimson lips curved into a smile that didn't reach her cold blue eyes. "Nate," she purred, ignoring me completely. "It's been too long."

Nathaniel didn't return the smile. "What's this about, Isabella?"

She produced a manila envelope from her designer bag with a dramatic flourish. "I think you'll find this very interesting. Your dear grandfather made some... interesting provisions before he passed."

Vanessa placed a recording device on the table. "Play it," Isabella commanded.

The voice that filled the room was unmistakably Edward Martin's, though weaker than I remembered. "If Nathaniel divorces Evelyn within five years of our agreement, the Pineview estate and controlling shares revert to the family trust..."

The blood drained from my face. Nathaniel went rigid beside me. Isabella's smile widened. "Surprise, darling. Your marriage was part of a business deal all along."

Evelyn remained silent, her delicate features unreadable, her gaze icy and detached.

Isabella pressed on, "Evelyn, do you know why Nathaniel is so insistent on you having a child?"

"So you called me here just to tell me that?" Evelyn countered, her voice laced with skepticism.

"Not entirely. I thought you deserved the truth rather than being kept in the dark. Nathaniel didn’t announce your marriage because he wants a future with you—he did it to appease his grandfather and to convince you to agree to a child."

A cold glint flashed in Evelyn’s eyes. Though her lips curved slightly, her expression remained rigid. "So Nathaniel told you to keep this from me, yet you’re betraying his trust?"

"Evelyn, we’re both women. I couldn’t let you live a lie."

"Then I suppose I should thank you?"

"No need. After all, Nathaniel and I will be raising the child together. If anything, I should thank you for carrying our baby."

Isabella’s tone dripped with smug satisfaction, deliberately provocative.

Evelyn’s breath hitched, disbelief flickering across her face before hardening into something sharper.

Her voice was steady but frosty. "If Nathaniel wanted this kept secret, why would you risk telling me? Unless—this is just another one of your lies. Are you that desperate for attention? Stop wasting my time with these petty games."

"You don’t believe me?"

"Why should I?"

"Time will prove everything. Once you give birth, you’ll see exactly what Nathaniel intends to do."

Isabella sounded utterly unshaken.

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her phone before she abruptly ended the call.

Of course, she wouldn’t take Isabella’s words at face value. The woman had spun too many falsehoods before—this was likely just another ploy to undermine Nathaniel’s public acknowledgment of their marriage.

Yet, despite herself, doubt gnawed at her.

Before she could process it, a voice message arrived from Isabella. Reluctantly, Evelyn played it.

A deep, familiar voice filled the air: "Of course, I just want kids."

Her stomach twisted.

Then came Isabella’s taunting follow-up:
[Still in denial? That’s Nathaniel’s promise to me. Ask Thomas or Samuel—they’ll confirm it. Or wait until after the baby’s born. Unless you’re too scared to face the truth.]

Evelyn’s fingers hovered over the screen before she typed back: [Go to hell.]

She tossed her phone aside, staring blankly out the window, her mind in turmoil.

Is that really what Nathaniel wants?

She refused to believe it.

But that voice—his voice—was undeniable.

Evelyn knew exactly who had orchestrated the recent media frenzy. She had even hinted her suspicions to Nathaniel.

Yet he had done nothing.

Was it because he lacked proof? Or because he simply didn’t care?

She searched for excuses to defend him but found none. A bitter laugh escaped her.

While Evelyn wrestled with frustration and hurt, Isabella reveled in triumph.

Ever since the Martin Group had publicly confirmed Nathaniel’s marriage to Evelyn, Isabella had deliberately avoided contacting him. She had waited, expecting him to reach out—but two days had passed in silence.



###Chapter 104

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden streaks across her blueprints. She rubbed her temples, trying to focus, but Nathaniel's words from last night still echoed in her mind.

"I need you to trust me, Evelyn."

Trust. That word had haunted her ever since Isabella had reappeared in their lives.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Gregory.

"Meeting with Summit Realty in thirty. Sebastian is pushing for revisions. Again."

Evelyn sighed. The project was already behind schedule, and now Sebastian Wilson, the relentless CEO of Summit Realty, was demanding changes. She grabbed her tablet and headed out, her heels clicking against the polished marble floor.

Downstairs, Nathaniel was in the lobby, speaking in hushed tones with Samuel Yates, his secretary. His sharp suit and composed demeanor contrasted with the tension in his jaw. When he spotted her, his expression softened—just slightly.

"Evelyn."

She nodded. "Nathaniel."

A beat of silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken words.

Samuel cleared his throat. "Sir, the board is waiting."

Nathaniel hesitated, as if he wanted to say more, but instead, he turned and strode toward the elevators.

Evelyn exhaled. Whatever was going on with Isabella, she couldn’t let it distract her—not now.

Outside, the city hummed with life. The Summit Realty building loomed ahead, its glass façade reflecting the sky.

Inside the conference room, Sebastian leaned back in his chair, a smirk playing on his lips. Jonathan Blake, his project manager, stood beside him, arms crossed.

"Ah, Evelyn. Right on time." Sebastian's voice dripped with false warmth.

She forced a smile. "Let’s get started."

As she presented the revised designs, Sebastian interrupted. "Still not what we envisioned. We need something bolder."

Evelyn clenched her fists under the table. "These changes will delay the project by weeks."

Sebastian shrugged. "Then work faster."

Her phone buzzed again—a notification from an unknown number. A photo of Nathaniel and Isabella, standing close in what looked like a private conversation.

Her breath hitched.

Sebastian smirked. "Problem, Evelyn?"

She locked her phone. "No. Let’s continue."

But her mind raced. Who sent that photo? And why?

The meeting dragged on, every second stretching her patience thinner. When it finally ended, she rushed outside, dialing Caroline.

"Caroline, I need your help."

Her cousin’s voice was sharp with concern. "What’s wrong?"

Evelyn hesitated. "I think someone’s watching Nathaniel. And me."

A pause. Then, "Meet me at the café in twenty. We’ll figure this out."

As she ended the call, a black car pulled up beside her. The window rolled down, revealing Vanessa, Isabella’s agent.

"Evelyn," she said smoothly. "We need to talk."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. "About what?"

Vanessa smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. "About the future of your marriage."

The door swung open.

Evelyn stared, her heart pounding.

What game was Isabella playing now?

And more importantly—was Nathaniel part of it?

Evelyn was relieved that she had discovered Nathaniel's scheme through Donovan. Now she could devise a countermove against Isabella. To Evelyn, the authenticity of Nathaniel's voice message was irrelevant—what mattered was whether Isabella bought into it.

At six-thirty sharp, Nathaniel returned to Pineview Villa.

He climbed the stairs to find Evelyn seated motionless before the floor-to-ceiling window, her gaze distant. Softly, he asked, "Evelyn, shall we have dinner at Martin Manor tonight?"

"I'd rather not," she replied flatly, her expression unreadable.

Nathaniel's brow furrowed at her subdued demeanor. "Is something wrong?"

She didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she lifted her eyes to meet his, her voice steady. "Nathaniel, why did you announce our marriage so abruptly? Was it truly because you couldn’t stand the public scrutiny I faced?"

His gaze darkened. "Evelyn, what are you implying?"

"Nothing," she said coolly. "Just curiosity. Care to enlighten me?"

"What do you think the reason was?" he countered.

"How would I know? Your thoughts have always been a mystery."

"Is it that you can’t decipher them—or that you refuse to try?" Nathaniel checked his watch. When she remained silent, his tone softened. "Fine. No need to answer. But let’s head downstairs. I promised Grandfather we’d join him for dinner. Do you really want to disappoint him?"

He knew her weakness—Edward Martin.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Of course, she wouldn’t let Edward down.

She shot Nathaniel a fleeting glance, the urge to confront him simmering beneath her composed exterior. But what good would it do?

A bitter smile ghosted her lips before she schooled her features. "Go ahead. I’ll change and meet you downstairs."

Nathaniel’s frown deepened as she stood. Just as she turned toward the walk-in closet, his hand shot out, gripping her wrist. With a firm tug, he pulled her against his chest.

His fingers tilted her chin up, forcing her to meet his piercing gaze. "Evelyn, what’s this about? Are you angry that I went public without consulting you? Or are you worried your ex might find out and get the wrong idea?"

Her breath hitched. From this angle, Nathaniel’s sharp jawline and composed demeanor were impossible to ignore—regal, controlled, infuriatingly perfect.

When she didn’t respond, his grip tightened. "Answer me. What do you want?"

"The media backlash has been relentless. Am I not allowed to react?"

"Is that all that’s bothering you?"

"I’m not upset," she lied. "Just wondering if you’ve uncovered who orchestrated this mess."

A beat of silence.

Evelyn pressed on. "Aren’t you curious?"

"Who do you suspect?"

"Isabella."

Her answer was blunt, devoid of hesitation.

Nathaniel’s expression remained unreadable. "Do you have proof?"

"Who else would gain from this?"

"We’ll see when the investigation concludes," he said calmly.

Evelyn’s laugh was hollow. "With the Martin Group’s resources, shouldn’t this take hours—not days?"

His eyes narrowed. "What are you getting at?"

"Have you even looked into Isabella? Or have you been protecting her all along?"

Her stare was unflinching, demanding the truth he seemed so determined to evade.
###Chapter 105

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew over the blueprints, making last-minute adjustments to the resort project. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the crisp scent of tracing paper.

"Evelyn?" Gabrielle's voice came through the intercom. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

"Send him in," she replied, rolling up the plans just as Gregory strode in, his usual confident self slightly ruffled today. His tie was loosened, and there was an unfamiliar tension in his jaw.

"We have a problem," he said without preamble, dropping a folder onto her desk. "Summit Realty just pulled out of the waterfront development."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. "What? That was our biggest contract this quarter!"

Gregory ran a hand through his hair. "Sebastian Wilson claims budget constraints, but I heard through the grapevine that Nathaniel's been making moves behind the scenes."

The mention of her husband's name sent a jolt through her. Three months since their separation, and still their professional worlds kept colliding. She flipped open the folder, scanning the termination notice with growing disbelief.

"This can't be coincidence," she murmured. The timing was too perfect - just as her firm was about to break ground on their most ambitious project yet.

Gregory leaned against her desk. "I tried reaching Jonathan Blake, but his phone goes straight to voicemail. It's like they've all gone underground."

Evelyn's phone buzzed. An unknown number. She answered cautiously. "Evelyn Mitchell speaking."

"Mrs. Martin," purred a familiar feminine voice that made her grip tighten around the phone. "Or should I say, ex-Mrs. Martin now?"

"Isabella." Evelyn's voice was ice. "What do you want?"

A light laugh. "Just thought you should know - Nathaniel and I are attending the architectural gala tonight. Together. As guests of honor." A pause. "You might want to stay home. Wouldn't want you to... make a scene."

The line went dead. Evelyn stared at the phone, her pulse roaring in her ears. The gala was supposed to be her night - the unveiling of her resort design to potential investors.

Gregory was watching her carefully. "Bad news?"

She set the phone down with deliberate calm. "Change of plans. We're going to need your sister's help with something."

"Danielle? Why?"

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Because if Isabella Davis thinks she can steal my husband and sabotage my career in one night, she's about to learn why they say hell hath no fury..."

Outside, the first drops of rain began to fall against the window, as if nature itself sensed the storm brewing inside Evelyn Mitchell.

Nathaniel and Evelyn remained locked in their half-embrace, close enough to see the storm brewing in each other’s eyes.

Nathaniel narrowed his gaze, a mix of irritation and reluctant amusement playing across his striking features. The corner of his lips twitched into a smirk. "So, you genuinely believe I’m shielding her on purpose?"

"Nathaniel, what other explanation is there?" Evelyn countered, her voice steady despite the tension. "Isabella has always been your priority."

A cold chuckle escaped him as he released her, stepping back to create a deliberate distance between them. His expression darkened, the amusement gone. "You’ve really outdone yourself this time, Evelyn. Going to such lengths just to pick a fight with me."

With that, he turned on his heel and strode downstairs, leaving her standing there, his words echoing in her mind.

What did he mean by that?

Did I misread the situation?

Evelyn pressed her lips together, exhaling slowly before changing into something more presentable. By the time she descended, Nathaniel was already in the car, his posture rigid. She slid into the passenger seat without a word, and the silence between them stretched all the way to the Martin estate.

Earlier, Nathaniel had called ahead to inform his parents they’d be joining for dinner. Edward, ever the optimist, had immediately shared the news with Winston. "Perhaps Nathaniel is finally coming to his senses. Evelyn’s influence, no doubt."

Winston chuckled. "You spoil her too much. If Nathaniel finds out, he might get jealous."

"He wouldn’t dare," Edward scoffed. "If we don’t treat Evelyn well, who will?"

His heart ached for her—especially knowing how little her own parents had done for her. That only strengthened his resolve to make sure she felt valued in their home.

Dinner began promptly at seven-thirty. The family gathered around the table, the atmosphere warm—except for the unspoken tension between Nathaniel and Evelyn. Edward kept glancing between them, his smile unwavering.

Richard cleared his throat pointedly, but Edward waved him off. "What? If you’re sick, take medicine. Don’t sit there coughing like you’re dropping hints. They’re married—can’t I enjoy watching them together?"

Richard sighed in resignation, while Evelyn ducked her head, her cheeks burning. Nathaniel, however, remained unfazed.

Edward frowned, shooting his grandson a pointed look. "Nathaniel, do you have something to say?"

Nathaniel blinked, feigning innocence. "About what, Grandfather?"

Edward’s disappointment was palpable. "Must I spell it out for you? Take care of your wife."

Evelyn quickly interjected, "That’s not necessary. I can manage on my own."

"Nonsense," Edward insisted. "You’re married now. There’s no need for such formality. I want to see you two looking out for each other."

His words only deepened Evelyn’s embarrassment, her face flushing further. The table fell silent, all eyes now fixed on the couple.

Nathaniel let out a low laugh. "Grandfather, she doesn’t need anything. Stop forcing it."

"You’re her husband," Edward snapped. "Must she beg before you lift a finger?"

Victoria chimed in, her tone gentle but firm. "Nathaniel, your grandfather is right. Evelyn’s just being polite—she shouldn’t have to ask."

The weight of their expectations pressed down on them, the air thick with unspoken tension.

And Nathaniel?

He simply smirked, his gaze locked onto Evelyn’s, as if daring her to challenge him further.
###Chapter 106

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the bedroom. Evelyn stirred beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming with the memory of Nathaniel's touch from the night before. She turned her head, expecting to find him beside her, but the space was empty.

A note rested on his pillow.

"Early meeting. Didn’t want to wake you. I’ll be back by noon."

She traced the elegant script with her fingertips, a small smile playing on her lips. Even after all this time, he still left her notes.

Evelyn stretched, then reached for her phone. Three missed calls from Gregory. She frowned. He never called this early unless it was urgent.

She dialed him back.

"Gregory? What’s going on?"

His voice was tense. "Evelyn, we have a problem. The Summit Realty deal—Sebastian Wilson just pulled out. He cited 'creative differences.'"

Her stomach dropped. That project was their biggest commission this year. "What? We’ve been working on this for months!"

"I know. But he’s refusing to negotiate. Says he’s taking the contract elsewhere."

Evelyn clenched her jaw. "I’ll handle it. Set up a meeting with him. Today."

She hung up, already mentally rearranging her schedule.

Downstairs, Alfred had prepared her usual coffee—black with a hint of cinnamon. She took a sip, letting the warmth steady her nerves.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted. "Will you be needing the car?"

"Yes, please. And tell Rosalind I’ll skip breakfast."

She dressed quickly, opting for a sleek navy pantsuit—power attire. As she fastened her watch, her phone buzzed again.

This time, it was Isabella.

Evelyn hesitated. They hadn’t spoken since the gala incident.

She answered. "Isabella?"

"Evelyn." The other woman’s voice was cool. "We need to talk."

Evelyn’s grip tightened on her phone. "About?"

"Not over the phone. Meet me at The Velvet Lounge. One hour."

Before Evelyn could respond, the line went dead.

She exhaled sharply. First Sebastian, now Isabella.

Something was definitely wrong.

As she stepped outside, the sleek black town car was already waiting. She slid into the backseat, her mind racing.

One crisis at a time. First, Sebastian Wilson. Then, whatever game Isabella was playing.

But deep down, she knew—today was going to be a battlefield.

Nathaniel gave a slight nod. "Alright."

He passed the mashed potatoes to Evelyn and asked, "Would you like some?" Before she could respond, Edward cut in with disapproval, "What kind of husband are you? Evelyn doesn’t like mashed potatoes. She prefers the steamed lobster. Help her with the shell."

Evelyn’s brows knitted briefly. "Edward, I can have a little mashed potatoes. And I can handle the lobster myself."

"Evelyn, don’t be modest. You married Nathaniel, but he hasn’t treated you the way you deserve. Consider this him making up for it. Enjoy yourself."

She fell silent, her gaze flickering toward Nathaniel instinctively.

He met her eyes, a faint smirk playing on his lips. "What would you like?"

She pressed her lips together. "Anything is fine."

Without another word, Nathaniel placed several dishes in front of Evelyn, then meticulously peeled the lobster meat onto her plate.

Evelyn’s eyes widened in surprise. Edward and Victoria exchanged stunned glances, while Richard chuckled quietly into his napkin. Nathaniel leaned back slightly. "Try them. Let me know which one you prefer."

Truthfully, Evelyn was already full, but with Nathaniel serving her and everyone watching, refusing would only invite more scrutiny. She wasn’t worried about Nathaniel’s reaction—she just didn’t want to make Edward uncomfortable.

After dinner, Richard brought out his prized coffee blend, brewing a cup for Edward before offering one to Evelyn. She accepted it politely but didn’t take a sip—pregnancy meant cutting back on caffeine.

Nathaniel’s gaze lingered on her, his expression unreadable, making her fingers tighten around the cup.

Then, abruptly, he spoke. "Grandfather, I’ve made a decision. Would you like to hear it?"

Edward raised an eyebrow. "What decision?"

All eyes turned to Nathaniel.

Calmly, he continued, "Now that Evelyn and I have gone public with our relationship, it’s time to address what you’ve been concerned about. We’ve been married for a year. It’s only natural to start planning for a child."

His tone was casual, as if discussing something mundane.

The declaration was so sudden that silence blanketed the room.

Edward’s gaze darted toward Evelyn, who sat motionless, her lips pressed into a thin line.

Edward frowned. "Why bring this up now? You two just went public."

"It’s not sudden. I simply believe it’s the right time. Isn’t this what you’ve always wanted? Or are you unhappy about it?"

"This isn’t about happiness, Nathaniel. This is a serious matter. Have you truly thought it through?"

Edward’s expression darkened, but Nathaniel only smiled faintly. "Grandfather, if I hadn’t considered it carefully, I wouldn’t have mentioned it. You know me better than that."

"I don’t want to."

Evelyn’s voice was soft but firm.

She met Nathaniel’s gaze squarely and repeated, "Nathaniel, I don’t want to."

Every word he’d said to Edward had been clear to her. He suggested having a child simply because it was time—not out of love or desire. It wasn’t so different from what Isabella had insinuated. Even if Isabella had exaggerated, the conclusion remained the same.

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed slightly, though his expression betrayed nothing. "Give me a reason," he murmured, his voice low and rough.
###Chapter 107

The morning sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of our penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. I stretched beneath the silk sheets, my fingers brushing against the empty space where Nathaniel should have been. The cold sheets confirmed what I already knew - he'd left for work hours ago without waking me.

My phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. Gabrielle's name flashed across the screen with three missed calls and a string of urgent texts about the Montgomery project revisions. I groaned, rubbing sleep from my eyes. The architectural firm had been swamped since Gregory and I landed the high-profile commercial development downtown.

The scent of freshly brewed coffee lured me into the kitchen where Alfred had left my usual breakfast spread - avocado toast, Greek yogurt with berries, and a steaming cup of dark roast. The elderly butler had worked for the Martins longer than I'd been alive, yet still remembered my exact caffeine preference.

"Morning, Mrs. Martin," Alfred greeted as he entered, carrying a stack of mail. "Mr. Martin asked me to remind you about the charity gala tonight. He's arranged for Seraphina to deliver your gown by noon."

I nearly choked on my coffee. "The Mystica? Nathaniel booked her?" The legendary designer rarely took private commissions anymore.

Alfred's lips twitched. "Apparently Mr. Martin called in a rather substantial favor from his grandfather."

My fingers trembled as I scrolled through my calendar. Between client meetings and site inspections, I'd completely forgotten about the Children's Hospital fundraiser. Nathaniel's family had chaired the event for decades, and tonight marked my first public appearance as his wife since our whirlwind wedding three months ago.

The penthouse elevator dinged, and Nathaniel strode in, his charcoal suit accentuating his broad shoulders. My breath caught as it always did when he entered a room - that magnetic presence that made everyone else fade into the background.

"You're supposed to be at the office," I said, setting down my coffee.

Nathaniel loosened his tie with one hand, the other producing a velvet box from his pocket. "Forgot something important." He flipped open the lid, revealing an emerald necklace that matched my engagement ring perfectly. "For tonight. Thought it might help you forgive me for working late all week."

I traced the glittering stones, remembering how Isabella Davis had worn emeralds to last year's gala when she was still Nathaniel's date. The media would undoubtedly make the comparison.

Nathaniel's phone buzzed. Samuel's name appeared with a red "URGENT" tag. His jaw tightened. "I have to take this."

As he stepped onto the terrace, my own phone rang. Gregory's gruff voice came through. "Evelyn, we've got a problem. Summit Realty just filed an injunction against the Montgomery project. Sebastian Wilson claims we stole his designs."

My stomach dropped. "That's impossible! Those were my original sketches."

"Meet me at the office in thirty. We need to review everything before the client meeting."

I was halfway to the shower when Nathaniel reappeared, his expression grim. "Change of plans. Grandfather wants us at the estate immediately. There's been... developments with Isabella."

The name hung between us like a storm cloud. Isabella had been suspiciously quiet since our wedding, and Nathaniel's sudden tension told me whatever news Edward Martin had wasn't good.

"Can it wait? Gregory just called about-"

"No." Nathaniel's tone brooked no argument. "This involves the family. It takes priority."

I bit back my protest. The Martins operated by their own rules, and I was still learning to navigate their world. As I hurried to dress, one thought consumed me - whatever Isabella had planned, it threatened far more than just my work schedule. The carefully constructed peace of our new marriage was about to be tested.

"Nathaniel, if not for the unforeseen circumstances, we would have been divorced by now. Even though we've gone public with our relationship, it's absurd to discuss having children merely two days later. A marriage built without love will only bring misery to any child born into it. I refuse to bring a child into this arrangement."

Her words were firm, her gaze unwavering.

Nathaniel's expression remained impassive, but his eyes darkened, sharp as winter frost. "So you're saying if I never love you, you'll never bear my child?"

His voice was devoid of warmth, cutting through the air like a blade.

Evelyn paused, then let out a bitter laugh. "You've already decided you'll never love me. Why, then, would you demand a child from me?"

A mocking smile curled his lips. "Is this your way of avoiding responsibility? Playing word games to dodge the inevitable?"

"Nathaniel, you declared you'd never love me. Yet you expect me to submit to your whims without question. Even if you brought this up in front of Edward, my answer wouldn’t change. Unless you love me, I won’t have your child."

Her tone was final, the tension thickening between them.

Edward, sensing the brewing storm, quickly intervened. "Let’s discuss this calmly. Evelyn is right—if you want a future with her, you must show sincerity. You can’t expect her to agree to something so significant without trust."

He glanced at Richard and Victoria, who nodded in agreement.

Nathaniel’s smile turned icy, his voice laced with disdain. "Grandfather, you always take her side. Do you truly believe her excuses? Or is there another reason she’s so adamant?"

Edward’s face hardened, his eyes warning Nathaniel to stop.

But Nathaniel ignored it.

His gaze locked onto Evelyn, cold and accusing. "Is it because you're waiting for your ex to return? If you had my child, you’d have to take it with you when you leave. No man would raise another’s child willingly. Isn’t that why you refuse? Have you been planning this all along?"

Evelyn met his stare without flinching, her voice eerily calm. "If that’s what you believe, then so be it."

"You won’t even deny it?"

"Nathaniel, if you think so little of me, why keep asking?" Her lips pressed into a thin line, her eyes glacial.

Edward, alarmed by the escalating hostility, stood abruptly. "Evelyn, help me to my room. We need to talk—privately."

She nodded, assisting him out of the dining room without another glance at Nathaniel.

Once inside Edward’s study, the door shut firmly behind them. They moved to the balcony, the evening air cool against their skin.

Edward sighed. "Evelyn, is there something you’re not telling me?"

Her shoulders relaxed slightly, and she exhaled. "Edward… I’m afraid I’ll disappoint you."



###Chapter 108

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort that could redefine Martin Group's portfolio. But her mind was elsewhere.

Nathaniel had been distant lately. Ever since Isabella's sudden reappearance, tension had coiled between them like a silent storm. Evelyn exhaled sharply, pushing a stray lock of hair behind her ear. She refused to let doubt creep in.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Gregory: "Meeting in 10. Edward’s pushing for revisions."

Evelyn groaned. Edward Martin, Nathaniel’s grandfather, was relentless. Every design had to be perfect—no, beyond perfect. She gathered her files, her heels clicking against the polished floor as she headed to the conference room.

Inside, the air was thick with unspoken tension. Nathaniel sat at the head of the table, his jaw set, his stormy gaze fixed on the screen displaying the resort’s mock-up. Isabella lounged beside him, her crimson lips curved in a smirk.

"Ah, Evelyn," Edward greeted, his voice smooth but edged with authority. "Let’s discuss these adjustments."

Evelyn forced a smile, though her grip on the files tightened. "Of course."

As the meeting progressed, Isabella leaned toward Nathaniel, whispering something that made his expression darken. Evelyn’s chest tightened. She knew that look—the one he reserved for battles he didn’t want to fight but couldn’t avoid.

Then, Edward dropped the bombshell.

"The board wants Isabella as the face of the resort’s campaign," he announced, his gaze flickering between Evelyn and Nathaniel. "Given her influence in the industry, it’s the logical choice."

Silence.

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms. This wasn’t just about business. This was a test—one designed to unravel her and Nathaniel’s fragile peace.

Nathaniel finally spoke, his voice low but firm. "We’ll discuss it privately."

Isabella’s smirk widened.

As Evelyn left the room, her phone buzzed again—this time, an unknown number. The message sent a chill down her spine:

"You don’t belong here, Evelyn. And soon, everyone will know why."

Her breath hitched. Someone was playing games.

And she refused to lose.

Edward Martin's brows knitted together in concern. "Evelyn, those words Nathaniel said... Is there truly someone else in your heart?"

"No, Grandpa, absolutely not. I swear to you, if I'm lying—"

"My dear, I'm not accusing you," Edward interrupted gently. "I only worry you're being treated unfairly. If such a person existed, you should have told me from the start. But if not, why would Nathaniel say those things? And why haven't you defended yourself?"

His tender inquiry tugged at Evelyn's heart.

She exhaled softly. "Grandpa, there was never anyone—not before, not now. Nathaniel only said that because I fabricated an excuse before our marriage to ease his concerns. As for now... any misunderstanding born from that lie doesn't matter to me anymore."

Edward's gaze sharpened. "What do you mean, Evelyn?"

"Edward," she murmured, steeling herself, "I think divorce is the best path. I won't use a child to chain Nathaniel down, and I refuse to bring a baby into this kind of environment. So, I need your help to keep my pregnancy a secret."

Silence stretched between them. Edward's expression darkened, his fingers tightening around his cane. When he finally spoke, his voice was heavy. "Is there truly no other way? Must it end like this?"

Evelyn's throat tightened. She hated hurting him—hated disappointing Richard and Victoria, who had shown her nothing but kindness. But the image of her child calling Isabella "Mom" was a blade twisting in her chest.

She had to choose.

Lowering her lashes, she couldn't bear Edward's searching gaze any longer. "Yes. It's necessary. Divorce is better for both of us. More than that... I won't let my child grow up in a home where love between parents is absent." Her voice wavered. "Forgive my selfishness, but I won't endure this pain—nor subject my baby to it."

Her lips pressed into a thin line, defiance and sorrow warring in her glistening eyes.

For a year, she had weathered her marriage to Nathaniel without complaint. She had made her choice.

But his plan to co-parent with Isabella? That was a line she couldn't cross. Their unbreakable bond was what made her feel truly... betrayed.

Seeing her anguish, Edward sighed. He reached out, patting her shoulder with grandfatherly warmth. "Very well. If your mind is made, I won't stop you. But remember this—don't sever ties with the Martins completely, or I will hunt you down."

He deliberately avoided mentioning the child, not wanting her to think his concern was solely for the heir. Yet he couldn't resist adding, "No matter what happens between you and Nathaniel, you'll always be family. And that baby? They will always belong to the Martins."

They spoke a while longer before Evelyn left, her steps slow with the weight of her decision.

In the living room, Nathaniel, Richard, and Victoria were embroiled in their own tense discussion.

Richard crossed his arms. "What's your game? One day you're flaunting your marriage, the next you're planning a child. Nathaniel, this erratic behavior is raising alarms."

"Do I need a reason for you to believe me?" Nathaniel's voice was ice. He lounged on the sofa, his striking features devoid of warmth, his detachment chilling.



###Chapter 109

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She studied his face—the sharp jawline, the faint stubble, the way his dark lashes rested against his cheeks. A warmth spread through her chest.

Last night had been… unexpected.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory: "Emergency meeting at the office. 9 AM sharp. Don’t be late."

Evelyn groaned. She had hoped for a slow morning, maybe breakfast in bed with Nathaniel. But duty called.

Carefully, she slipped out from under the covers, trying not to wake him. As she tiptoed toward the bathroom, Nathaniel’s voice, rough with sleep, stopped her.

"Running away already?"

She turned to find him watching her, his dark eyes amused.

"Work emergency," she said, gesturing to her phone.

He sat up, the sheets pooling around his waist. "Let me guess—Gregory?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Who else?"

Nathaniel smirked. "Tell him if he keeps stealing my wife’s mornings, I’ll have to have a word with him."

She laughed, leaning down to press a quick kiss to his lips. "I’ll pass that along."

———

The office was in chaos when Evelyn arrived. Gregory stood at the head of the conference table, his expression grim.

"Good, you’re here," he said. "We have a problem."

Evelyn took her seat. "What’s going on?"

Gregory slid a folder toward her. "Summit Realty just pulled out of the Riverside project."

Her stomach dropped. "What? Why?"

"Sebastian Wilson claims our designs don’t meet their ‘vision.’" Gregory’s jaw tightened. "But we all know the real reason."

Evelyn didn’t need him to spell it out. Sebastian had been making subtle jabs at her ever since she turned down his advances at last year’s gala.

She flipped open the folder, scanning the termination notice. "This is ridiculous. We’ve already invested months into this."

Gregory sighed. "I know. But unless we can change his mind—"

"I’ll talk to him," Evelyn said firmly.

Gregory raised a brow. "You sure that’s a good idea?"

"No. But I’m not letting him sabotage this project out of spite."

———

Sebastian’s office was all glass and steel, cold and impersonal—much like the man himself. He leaned back in his chair, smirking as Evelyn entered.

"Evelyn Mitchell. To what do I owe the pleasure?"

She didn’t bother with pleasantries. "Why did you terminate the contract?"

Sebastian feigned innocence. "Business decision. Nothing personal."

"Cut the act, Sebastian. We both know this is about me rejecting you."

His smirk faded. "You always were blunt."

"I don’t have time for games. Reinstate the contract, or I’ll take this to the press. Let’s see how your investors like hearing you tanked a multi-million-dollar project over wounded pride."

Sebastian’s eyes darkened. "You wouldn’t dare."

Evelyn held his gaze. "Try me."

For a long moment, they stared each other down. Then, with a scoff, Sebastian reached for his phone.

"Fine. But this isn’t over."

Evelyn turned on her heel. "It is for me."

———

Back in her car, Evelyn exhaled sharply. Her hands trembled slightly on the steering wheel. Confrontations like that always left her drained.

Her phone buzzed—a text from Nathaniel.

"Dinner tonight? Just the two of us."

A small smile tugged at her lips. After the day she’d had, she couldn’t think of anything better.

"Perfect. I’ll be home by seven."

As she drove away, she didn’t notice the sleek black car idling across the street—or the woman inside, watching her with narrowed eyes.

Isabella Davis had never been one to give up easily. And she wasn’t about to start now.

Evelyn shot Nathaniel a warning glance, silently urging him to watch his tone before addressing Victoria calmly. "Nathaniel, you and I are still young. There's no need to rush into having children. If you've truly considered this, wouldn't it be better to discuss it properly when we're both ready for a lifelong commitment?"

"Discuss?" Nathaniel scoffed, his voice edged with defiance. "Do you honestly think Evelyn will just agree? If we're going to have kids eventually, why delay?"

His stance was unyielding, almost rebellious. The more Evelyn resisted, the more determined he became.

Victoria sighed, her tone gentle but firm. "A child isn't just a checkbox on a list or a way to please your grandfather. Have you even considered whether you and Evelyn are truly prepared to raise one together?"

"A year ago, Grandpa wanted me to marry Evelyn, and none of you objected. I did as you asked. Now, a year later, shouldn’t you support my decision? Isn’t starting a family the natural next step?"

With that, Nathaniel stood abruptly, cutting off any further discussion.

Just as Richard and Victoria were about to respond, Evelyn walked in.

Victoria quickly smoothed her expression. "Evelyn, it's late. You and Nathaniel should head home now."

Evelyn nodded, her gaze flickering toward Nathaniel. He didn’t spare her a glance, already striding toward the door.

Watching his retreating figure, Victoria whispered, "Don’t mind him, dear. Edward will talk sense into him later."

Evelyn offered a faint smile. "It’s fine, Victoria. We’ll go now."

Outside, Nathaniel was already in the car, his expression icy, his dark eyes unreadable—cold enough to freeze the air between them.

She exhaled softly, sliding into the passenger seat and buckling up without a word. The engine roared to life, and silence settled heavily between them.

Evelyn had made her decision the moment she left Edward’s room. This time, nothing—no argument, no accident—would deter her from filing for divorce.

She was done.

Back at Pineview Villa, Nathaniel didn’t wait for her, already halfway up the stairs when she finally spoke. "Nathaniel. We need to talk."

He turned, his handsome features shadowed with irritation. "About what? How you refuse to have children because of someone else?"

Her jaw tightened. "Do you really believe that’s why I’m against it?"

"If it’s not, good. But even if it is, it won’t change my mind."

His gaze was unrelenting as he studied her before turning away again.

Evelyn clenched her fists, her voice steady but sharp. "So you’ve decided—regardless of what I want—that we must have a child?"

"It’s just a child, Evelyn. Why are you fighting this so hard?"

"Because you don’t love me. So why bring a child into this?"

His steps halted. Slowly, he turned, his eyes burning into hers. "And you? Do you love me?"

The question hung between them like an accusation.

Evelyn didn’t flinch. "So neither of us loves the other. Are we having a child to salvage this marriage, or do you have another motive?"

"You think I want a child because I have some hidden agenda?" Nathaniel let out a cold laugh, his expression darkening.

"Isn’t it obvious?" Evelyn met his glare head-on. "Why did you never tell me about Isabella and the fertility issues, Nathaniel? You keep saying I don’t trust you—but have you ever trusted me?"

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed dangerously. "How did you find out?"
###Chapter 110

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, she felt the weight of countless eyes on her. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the assembled guests, their whispers weaving through the air like an invisible net.

Nathaniel stood at the center of it all, his broad shoulders squared, his expression unreadable. He had summoned her here—urgently—without explanation.

"Evelyn," he said, his voice low but carrying. "We need to talk."

She swallowed hard, her fingers tightening around the strap of her bag. "About what?"

Before he could answer, Isabella stepped forward, her crimson dress a stark contrast to the muted tones of the room. "Oh, Evelyn," she purred, her lips curving into a smile that didn’t reach her eyes. "Didn’t Nathaniel tell you? There’s been a… complication."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. "What kind of complication?"

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "The board is questioning our marriage. They think it’s a sham."

A murmur rippled through the crowd. Evelyn’s breath hitched. "That’s ridiculous."

"Is it?" Isabella tilted her head, her gaze flickering between them. "You two barely spend any time together. No public appearances, no shared projects. It’s almost as if you’re avoiding each other."

Evelyn clenched her jaw. She had been busy with her firm, and Nathaniel had been buried in work—but that didn’t mean their marriage wasn’t real.

Nathaniel stepped closer, his hand brushing against hers. "We’ll handle this," he murmured, just for her.

But before she could respond, Edward Martin’s voice cut through the tension. "Enough."

The room fell silent as the patriarch of the Martin family stepped forward, his cane tapping against the marble floor. His sharp gaze landed on Evelyn. "If this marriage is real, prove it."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. "How?"

Edward’s lips thinned. "By moving into the estate. Permanently."

Nathaniel stiffened beside her. "Grandfather—"

"No arguments," Edward interrupted. "If you want to keep your position, you’ll abide by the family’s rules."

Evelyn’s mind raced. Living under the same roof as Nathaniel—constantly—would change everything. The carefully constructed distance between them would vanish.

And Isabella’s smirk told her that was exactly the point.

"Did you honestly believe you could conceal such a heartbreaking secret from me indefinitely? Or was it simply not the right time for me to know?"

Evelyn's voice was steady, but her fingers trembled slightly at her sides.

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened, his eyes narrowing as he studied her. "Did Isabella tell you?"

She didn’t confirm, but the silence between them was answer enough.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, her tone measured. "Nathaniel, you want us to start a family, but Isabella can never have children because of what happened—because of you. How do you plan to make that right for her?"

"That’s between her and me," he replied, his voice like steel. "I’ll handle it. It won’t affect us."

"It will affect us," Evelyn countered, her voice rising just a fraction. "Because this ties you to her forever. I refuse to live with my husband—the father of my child—bound to another woman by guilt and obligation. Right now, it’s just me suffering through this, but if we had a child? They’d grow up in the shadow of that connection. I won’t let them believe their parents stayed together out of duty rather than love."

Her expression was ice-cold, her delicate features set in unyielding resolve.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened, his dark eyes flashing with something dangerous. "So, at the end of all this, you’re still refusing to have a child?"

"Are you so desperate for one that you’d ignore everything I’ve just said?"

The air between them crackled with tension, neither willing to back down.

Nathaniel smirked, but there was no warmth in it. "Evelyn, do you really think you can stop me?"

The implication was clear. If he wanted her pregnant, he could make it happen.

But she was already one step ahead.

His words only solidified her decision.

Meeting his gaze unflinchingly, she said, "Nathaniel, I think we need space. Starting tomorrow, I’m moving out."

"Moving out?" His voice dropped to a lethal whisper.

"What exactly are you trying to accomplish?"

"I’m not trying to do anything," she said calmly. "I just know that staying like this will only make us both miserable. We’re at an impasse. Maybe time apart will help us see things clearly."

"No."

The rejection was instant, absolute.

But Evelyn wasn’t deterred. She had planned for this.

Pressing her lips together, she said softly, "Nathaniel, you can force me to carry a child, but you can’t force me to keep it. Do you really want to drag us both through that?"

His expression darkened, his voice devoid of all warmth. "Are you threatening me?"

The silence that followed was heavier than any argument.



###Chapter 111

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew over the blueprints as she made last-minute adjustments to the resort project. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint aroma of ink from her sketches.

Gabrielle, her assistant, burst in with a stack of files. "Evelyn, the client just called. They want to move the meeting up by two hours."

Evelyn's pen stilled. "What? That's in forty minutes!" She glanced at her watch, heart pounding. Nathaniel would kill her if she was late again. Their last argument about her workaholic tendencies still echoed in her mind.

She grabbed her blazer and dashed for the elevator. As the doors closed, her phone buzzed. Nathaniel's name flashed on the screen.

"Where are you?" His deep voice held an edge. "The car's been waiting downstairs for fifteen minutes."

"Change of plans," she panted, stepping into the lobby. "Client moved the meeting. I have to—"

"No." The single word brooked no argument. "We're having lunch with Grandfather Edward today. You promised."

Evelyn bit her lip. The black town car idled at the curb, Samuel Yates standing stiffly beside it. Across the street, a familiar blonde figure exited a boutique. Isabella. The woman paused, locking eyes with Evelyn before slipping on oversized sunglasses.

"Evelyn?" Nathaniel's voice softened. "Are you still there?"

She swallowed hard. "I'll be there in twenty."

The line went dead. As she slid into the leather seats, Evelyn couldn't shake the image of Isabella's smirk. The woman had been appearing more frequently around Martin Group properties lately. Coincidence? She doubted it.

The car pulled up to Martin Manor precisely as Evelyn finished reapplying her lipstick. Nathaniel waited at the grand entrance, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders. His stormy expression cleared when he saw her.

"You made it." He brushed a kiss against her temple. "Grandfather's in rare form today."

Inside the opulent dining room, Edward Martin held court at the head of the table. Victoria and Richard sat to his right, while an empty chair waited beside Nathaniel.

"Ah, Evelyn!" Edward's voice boomed. "We were just discussing your latest project. Quite ambitious for someone with your... limited experience."

Evelyn's smile tightened. She felt Nathaniel's hand squeeze hers under the table.

Before she could respond, Winston entered with a silver tray. "Mr. Martin, your two o'clock appointment has arrived early."

Edward dabbed his mouth with a linen napkin. "Show her to the drawing room."

Her? Evelyn's stomach dropped as Nathaniel stiffened beside her.

Isabella's laughter floated down the hallway moments before she appeared in the doorway, dressed in a cream sheath dress that hugged every curve. "I hope I'm not interrupting family time?" Her gaze lingered on Nathaniel before shifting to Evelyn. "Though I suppose not everyone here is family, are they?"

The grandfather clock ticked loudly in the sudden silence. Evelyn's champagne flute trembled in her hand as Nathaniel's grip on her knee turned vice-like.

Edward smiled. "Isabella, my dear, come sit by me. We have much to discuss about your new venture with Martin Holdings."

Evelyn's blood ran cold. Since when did Isabella have business dealings with the Martins? She turned to Nathaniel, but his stony profile gave nothing away.

The game had just changed. And Evelyn wasn't sure she knew the rules anymore.

Evelyn spoke with quiet resolve, "I'm not threatening you, Nathaniel. I'm simply presenting you with a choice. If you truly want children, then you must cut all ties with Isabella—completely and permanently. No more contact, no more excuses."

Nathaniel remained silent.

Evelyn already knew the answer before she even asked. Nathaniel would never fully sever his connection to Isabella, nor would he sacrifice their relationship just for her.

To Nathaniel, Evelyn was nothing more than a wife arranged by Edward.

Beyond that title, she likely meant nothing at all.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips, though her voice remained steady. "Nathaniel, stop being selfish. If you want to keep playing games, find someone else. Isabella might be content being your backup, but I refuse to be part of it. I won’t pretend anymore, won’t lie to myself that you two are 'just friends.' Let’s take some time apart."

Without waiting for a response, she turned and walked upstairs.

She couldn’t risk staying another second—she might break down right there.

Being with Nathaniel allowed her to love him as his wife, but it also meant enduring his closeness with the woman he truly loved. She couldn’t bear it any longer.

Better to endure the sharp pain now than to lose her dignity later.

After Evelyn disappeared upstairs, Nathaniel stood frozen in place, his expression dark and unreadable. Minutes passed before he finally moved, retreating to the bedroom where Evelyn was already in bed. Instead of joining her, he sank into the nearby armchair, his piercing gaze fixed on her still form.

The memory of her revulsion haunted him. The gentle, compliant Evelyn he knew was gone, replaced by someone who recoiled from his touch. It left him unsettled.

Was her reluctance to have children really about Isabella?

Or was it just another excuse to push him away?

His jaw tightened as a storm brewed behind his eyes.

The night passed without dreams.

When Evelyn woke the next morning, Nathaniel was already gone.

She didn’t rush to get ready. Instead, she stepped onto the balcony, lingering until the sound of a car engine faded into the distance. Only then did she retreat to the bathroom.

After breakfast, she called Gabrielle. "I won’t be in the office this morning. Inform Mr. Wilson—if anything urgent comes up, he can handle it."

Moments after hanging up, a message from Gregory appeared:

[Gregory]: Evelyn, is everything alright?

[Evelyn]: Nothing to worry about.

[Gregory]: Let me know if you need anything.

[Evelyn]: I will.

She closed the chat and opened a real estate app, quickly finding a furnished apartment near her firm. From browsing to signing the lease, it took her less than an hour.

She had enough savings to buy a place outright, but she’d never needed to—until now. With the possibility of leaving permanently, buying made no sense.

Once her plans were set, she packed a single suitcase—just clothes and essentials. She couldn’t take too much. This was meant to look like a temporary separation, a cooling-off period. She had to move carefully.

By midday, she was settled into the new apartment, having stocked up on necessities. Lunch was a quick affair, and as she finished, her phone buzzed.



###Chapter 112

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, her breath caught in her throat. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the marble floors, and the scent of fresh roses filled the air. But it wasn’t the opulence that unsettled her—it was the way Nathaniel’s gaze lingered on Isabella across the room.

She tightened her grip on her champagne flute, forcing a smile as Gregory leaned in. "You okay?" he murmured.

"Perfect," Evelyn lied, her eyes flickering back to Nathaniel. He stood tall in his tailored suit, his expression unreadable as Isabella whispered something in his ear. The sight sent a sharp pang through her chest.

Across the room, Victoria Martin watched the exchange with narrowed eyes. She had always favored Isabella, the poised socialite who knew how to navigate their world. Evelyn, with her architectural sketches and stubborn independence, was an outsider.

"Darling," Victoria called, beckoning Nathaniel over. "Come greet the Whitmores. They’ve been asking about you."

Nathaniel hesitated, his gaze briefly meeting Evelyn’s before he turned away. The dismissal stung.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her fingers trembling. She had fought so hard to prove herself—to be more than just the woman who married into the Martin fortune. But tonight, surrounded by glittering smiles and whispered judgments, she felt like an imposter in her own life.

Then, a familiar voice cut through the noise. "Evelyn!"

Caroline Sullivan wove through the crowd, her emerald gown shimmering under the lights. "There you are," she said, linking arms with Evelyn. "I’ve been looking everywhere for you."

Evelyn forced another smile. "Just admiring the decor."

Caroline snorted. "Right. Because you’d rather stare at wallpaper than your ridiculously handsome husband."

Evelyn’s laugh was hollow. If only it were that simple.

Nearby, Isabella’s laughter rang out, bright and practiced. Nathaniel’s lips curved in response, and Evelyn’s stomach twisted.

She had known about their history, of course. But seeing them together—so effortless, so right—was a brutal reminder of the ghosts she couldn’t compete with.

"Come on," Caroline said, tugging her toward the terrace. "Fresh air. Now."

Evelyn didn’t resist. As she stepped into the cool night, the weight on her chest eased slightly. The city lights stretched endlessly below, a stark contrast to the gilded cage she now called home.

She had married Nathaniel for love. But in a world where alliances mattered more than emotions, would it ever be enough?

Inside, the music swelled. The party continued without her.

And for the first time, Evelyn wondered if she had made a terrible mistake.

"Evelyn, are you going to keep pretending I don't exist until I walk out that door, or are you still processing Nathaniel's little surprise announcement about your marriage?"

Isaac's voice was sharp, laced with irritation.

Evelyn didn’t look up from the box she was taping shut. "I wasn’t ignoring you. I’ve just been busy. Moving takes time. Are you leaving soon?"

"Moving?" His brows shot up. "Where to?"

"I got my own place."

No point hiding it.

Isaac stiffened. "Why? Did you and Nathaniel have a fight?"

"It’s not a fight. Just… space."

"Evelyn, don’t lie to me. If you needed space, you could’ve taken it without moving out. This isn’t just about space, is it?"

His words cut through her flimsy excuse.

She exhaled, steadying herself. "I want a divorce."

"Because of Isabella?"

"Not just her. It’s better this way—for both of us."

"Marriage isn’t some game, Evelyn. Don’t make decisions when you’re upset."

But she wasn’t upset. That was the problem.

Her decision wasn’t impulsive. It was calculated, the inevitable conclusion after months of weighing the cracks in their marriage. Isabella was just the final push.

Some foundations couldn’t be fixed.

Nathaniel didn’t realize Evelyn was gone until he returned to Pineview Villa that night.

Alfred met him at the door. "Madam left this morning with a suitcase. She mentioned needing time apart. Did something happen?"

Nathaniel’s expression didn’t flicker. "Noted."

He headed upstairs.

The bedroom still smelled like her—vanilla and something floral. Her clothes hung in the closet, though the gaps where her favorite dresses had been were obvious. The vanity was bare, her creams and perfumes gone.

She hadn’t asked. Hadn’t waited.

Last night, she’d said she needed distance. Today, she’d taken it.

Fast.

His jaw tightened as he stood in the center of the room, the silence pressing in. After a long moment, he turned and walked to his study.

Fine. If she wants space, she can have it.

Neither of them reached out.

News traveled fast.

By morning, Edward Martin knew. His reaction? None.

Victoria, however, wasn’t so composed. "Edward, we can’t just do nothing! She moved out! If they stay apart like this, how will they ever reconcile?"

Edward didn’t look up from his newspaper. "Let them figure it out. Interfering will only make it worse."

Victoria’s hands trembled. "But—"

"Enough." His tone brooked no argument. "This isn’t a child’s tantrum. It’s their marriage. They’ll handle it—or they won’t."



###Chapter 113

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting delicate patterns across our bedroom floor. I stretched lazily, my fingers brushing against the cool silk sheets where Nathaniel had slept mere hours ago. The scent of his cologne still lingered faintly in the air—a mix of sandalwood and something distinctly him.

Downstairs, Alfred was already setting the breakfast table with his usual precision. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted with a slight bow. "Mr. Martin left early for the office. He mentioned an urgent board meeting."

I nodded, reaching for the steaming cup of Earl Grey he'd prepared. The porcelain was warm against my fingertips. "Thank you, Alfred. Has Isabella called?" The question slipped out before I could stop it.

Alfred's expression remained impassive. "No, madam. Though Mr. Yates did ring—something about the Blue Harbor project requiring your approval by noon."

The toast suddenly tasted like sawdust. Blue Harbor. The project Nathaniel had personally assigned to me after... after everything with Isabella. My stomach twisted. Was this his way of keeping me occupied? Or was it another test?

My phone buzzed with a text from Gregory: Emergency at the firm. Client wants revisions by EOD. Can you come in?

I exhaled sharply. Between Martin Group obligations and Mitchell & Wilson's growing workload, I was being pulled in too many directions. The grandfather clock in the foyer chimed nine times.

Then, another notification—this time from an unknown number. A photo loaded slowly: Nathaniel at some gala last night, his arm draped casually around Isabella's waist. Her crimson dress matched the smirk on her lips perfectly.

The caption read: Some things never change, do they, Evelyn?

The teacup shattered on the marble floor.

Alfred was at my side instantly. "Madam, are you—"

"I'm fine," I lied, stepping over the shards. My pulse roared in my ears. This wasn't just a provocation; it was warfare. And Isabella had just drawn first blood.

Upstairs, I yanked open my closet. If she wanted a fight, she'd get one. The emerald-green Valentino gown Nathaniel had bought me last month still hung in its garment bag—unworn, tags attached. Perfect for tonight's charity auction.

Let her play her games. By the time the evening ended, all of New York would see who truly belonged by Nathaniel Martin's side.

My fingers trembled as I dialed Caroline. "Cancel my afternoon meetings. We have a situation."

Somewhere across town, Isabella was probably admiring her handiwork. Little did she know—she'd just awakened the lioness.

"Stay out of it. They're adults—let them work through their own problems. Whatever happens between them is their decision," Edward stated firmly.

"Edward..."

Victoria opened her mouth to argue, but Richard cut in smoothly, "Dad's right. Evelyn and Nathaniel need to handle this themselves. Didn't you mention wanting to visit the countryside? We have some free time now. Why don't we go for a few days?"

And just like that, the Martins stepped back, leaving the couple to their turmoil.

Three days slipped by in a blur.

Evelyn buried herself in work, throwing every ounce of energy into her projects. But the moment she stepped back into her apartment, the carefully constructed mask of indifference crumbled, and the weight of her emotions pressed down on her chest like a stone.

She kept repeating the same mantra in her head: It's fine. Once I get past this, things will get better.

Easier said than done.

She pushed herself too hard, too fast—and it caught up with her.

On the fourth morning, a dull ache pulsed in her abdomen, sending a ripple of unease through her. Instinctively, she called Caroline and drove straight to the hospital.

Caroline stayed by her side through the examination. The doctor's words were measured but clear. "Nothing serious, but stress is taking its toll. You need to stay calm. The first trimester is critical, but even now, your emotional state affects the baby. You can't afford to neglect that."

Evelyn exhaled in relief.

Caroline squeezed her hand. "You'll be okay. Just focus on staying positive."

Evelyn nodded, silently vowing to keep her emotions in check—for the baby's sake.

As they walked toward the elevator, Caroline rattled off reminders. "Eat more. You're losing weight. And rest—"

"I know," Evelyn murmured, only half-listening.

She didn’t notice Thomas watching her from across the lobby.

Frowning, he muttered, "Evelyn? What’s she doing here?"

The woman beside him—his sister—glanced at her test results and shrugged. "Same as everyone else in this wing. Either a late period or a pregnancy scare. Isn’t that Nathaniel’s wife?"

"Yeah." His jaw tightened. "I need a smoke."

But instead of heading outside, he pulled out his phone and dialed. The moment Nathaniel answered, Thomas said, "I just saw Evelyn at the hospital."

"And?" Nathaniel’s voice was flat.

Thomas exhaled sharply. "She was coming out of the OB-GYN wing. What if she’s pregnant?"

Silence.

Nathaniel had always been careful—but accidents happened.

His voice was rough when he finally spoke. "Stop her from leaving. I’m on my way."

The line went dead.

Thomas shot a quick text to his sister before striding toward Evelyn.

She was sitting in the lobby, waiting for Caroline to finish up. Instead, Thomas appeared in front of her.

Evelyn’s brows knit together, but her expression remained neutral as he approached.

"Evelyn," he said, forcing a smile. "Fancy seeing you here."

"Small world," she replied coolly.

Thomas cleared his throat. "You here alone? Nathaniel didn’t come with you?"

"I’m visiting a friend," she said, her tone leaving no room for further questions.



###Chapter 114

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She traced the sharp line of his jaw with her fingertips, a small smile playing on her lips.

Last night had been... intense.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Mrs. Martin?" Alfred’s voice was muffled through the wood. "Mr. Edward has requested your presence in the study."

Evelyn frowned. Edward rarely summoned her directly. Something was up.

"I’ll be right there," she replied, slipping out of bed carefully to avoid waking Nathaniel.

Dressed in a simple blouse and slacks, she made her way downstairs. The grand study doors were slightly ajar, and she could hear the low murmur of voices inside.

Edward sat behind his mahogany desk, his expression unreadable. Across from him stood Gregory Wilson, his usual confident demeanor replaced with tension.

"You wanted to see me?" Evelyn stepped inside, her gaze flickering between them.

Edward gestured for her to sit. "Evelyn, we have a problem."

Gregory cleared his throat. "The Summit Realty deal is falling apart. Jonathan Blake just pulled out."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. That project was supposed to secure their firm’s reputation. "Why?"

"Sebastian Wilson happened," Gregory said bitterly. "He’s been whispering in Blake’s ear, offering better terms."

Evelyn clenched her fists. Sebastian had always been a thorn in her side, but this was outright sabotage.

Edward leaned forward. "We need to act fast. If Summit backs out, we lose not just the contract, but our investors’ trust."

Evelyn’s mind raced. There had to be a way to salvage this.

Then it hit her.

"I’ll talk to Blake myself," she declared.

Gregory blinked. "You think that’ll work?"

Evelyn smirked. "I know his weakness. And I’m not above using it."

Edward studied her for a long moment before nodding. "Do what you must."

As Evelyn turned to leave, Gregory caught her arm. "Be careful. Sebastian isn’t the type to play fair."

She met his gaze. "Neither am I."

The game was on.

Thomas spoke bluntly, "Evelyn, I just saw you coming out of the gynecology department."

Evelyn's pulse stuttered. Keeping her composure, she checked her phone discreetly and sent a quick text to Caroline before responding, "Oh? I wasn’t feeling well, so I thought I’d get checked."

"Is everything alright?"

"Nothing serious, just a minor issue."

"That’s good. If you’re unwell, why not call Nathaniel to pick you up?"

Thomas was grasping for conversation, silently willing Nathaniel to arrive soon before he annoyed Evelyn further.

Evelyn’s expression remained unreadable. "No need. I’ve moved out of Pineview Villa. We both need space, so it’s best we don’t see each other right now."

"You moved out?" Thomas blurted, as if uncovering a scandal. He reined in his shock, glancing around the crowded hospital before lowering his voice. "Did Nathaniel do something? If he messed up, just say the word. I’ll set him straight."

Evelyn let out a soft, humorless laugh.

Her skepticism was obvious.

Thomas rushed on, "Look, I know Nathaniel can be an overbearing ass, but we’ve been friends for years. Me, Theodore, and Felix—we’ll knock some sense into him. You two just went public. Shouldn’t this be the honeymoon phase?"

He rambled while Evelyn listened in silence.

When he finally paused, she spoke. "I appreciate the concern, but things between Nathaniel and me… they’re complicated. A step back is what we both need right now."

Thomas nodded reluctantly.

Evelyn studied him. "Was there anything else you needed, Thomas?"

"No."

"Then I should get going."

"Wait—" He checked his watch, then called after her. "Evelyn."

She turned. "Yes?"

"Just… Nathaniel still cares. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have revealed your relationship after hiding it for a year. Doesn’t that mean something?"

Evelyn froze briefly before shrugging. "Maybe."

She wouldn’t air Nathaniel’s flaws to his friends. Their marriage wasn’t about right or wrong—just terrible timing, making everything feel out of place.

Her gaze flickered over Thomas. "I have plans with a friend. Let’s talk another time?"

Thomas hesitated but had no excuse to keep her.

Evelyn offered a polite smile. "I’ll head out now. Goodbye."

As she turned to leave, Thomas fidgeted helplessly. Then, a deep, icy voice cut through the air.

"Going somewhere?"

Nathaniel strode toward them, his expression stormy, his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn the moment he entered.

Evelyn shot Thomas a knowing look—so that’s why he stalled me.

Thomas winced. "Evelyn, sorry, but I had to tell him. You two should talk."

With that, he bolted.

Nathaniel’s stare burned into her, his voice dangerously quiet. "Evelyn. Why were you at the hospital?"
###Chapter 115

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Pineview Villa, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. Evelyn stretched lazily in bed, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

She sighed, rolling onto her back. The silence of the villa was deafening. Even Alfred, their ever-discreet butler, moved about soundlessly, as if afraid to disturb the fragile peace.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory lit up the screen:

"Evelyn, the client wants revisions on the waterfront project. They’re pushing for a meeting today. Can you come in?"

She groaned. Another day of endless adjustments. Another day of pretending everything was fine.

Dragging herself out of bed, she caught her reflection in the mirror. Dark circles shadowed her eyes. When had she last slept properly?

The shower did little to revive her. As she dressed, her gaze lingered on the framed photo on the dresser—her and Nathaniel on their honeymoon in Santorini, his arms wrapped around her waist, both of them laughing under the Mediterranean sun.

Now, they barely spoke.

The drive to the office was a blur. The city passed by in streaks of gray and steel, matching her mood.

Gregory was already waiting when she arrived, his expression tight. "They want more glass, less concrete. Says it lacks 'warmth.'"

Evelyn resisted the urge to roll her eyes. "It’s a corporate building, not a spa."

He shrugged. "Tell that to the client."

She spent the next three hours redrawing plans, her frustration mounting with each stroke of her stylus. By noon, her head throbbed.

Her phone buzzed again—this time, a message from Nathaniel:

"Dinner with Edward tonight. Be ready by seven."

No "How’s your day?" No "Miss you." Just another obligation.

She exhaled sharply, tossing her phone onto the desk.

Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Everything okay?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Just peachy."

The rest of the afternoon dragged. By six, she was back at the villa, slipping into a sleek black dress—something elegant enough for Edward Martin’s standards but not so flashy as to draw criticism.

Nathaniel arrived at six-fifty, his tie perfectly knotted, his expression unreadable.

"You’re late," he said, glancing at his watch.

She bit back a retort. "Traffic."

The car ride was silent.

The restaurant was one of those exclusive places where the waiters knew everyone’s name and the wine list cost more than her monthly rent. Edward was already seated, his sharp gaze assessing them as they approached.

"Finally," he said, not bothering to hide his disapproval.

Nathaniel took his seat without a word. Evelyn plastered on a smile.

The dinner was a minefield of veiled jabs and loaded silences. Edward spoke of business, of legacy, of expectations. Nathaniel nodded along, his responses measured, detached.

Evelyn picked at her food, her appetite gone.

Then Edward dropped the bomb.

"I’ve arranged for you both to attend the charity gala next week. The press will be there. It’s time to show a united front."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t argue.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. Another performance.

As the dessert plates were cleared, Edward leaned in, his voice low. "And Nathaniel, I expect you to handle the Singapore deal personally. No more delays."

Nathaniel’s eyes flickered—something dark, unspoken. "Understood."

The ride home was colder than before.

Evelyn stared out the window, the city lights blurring into streaks.

When they finally reached the villa, Nathaniel headed straight for his study without a word.

She stood in the grand foyer, the weight of the evening pressing down on her.

Then her phone buzzed—a message from an unknown number:

"We need to talk. It’s about Nathaniel."

Her breath caught.

The screen went dark before she could reply.

Evelyn's brows knitted together. "What would I be doing at the hospital? I just came for a routine check-up. I haven’t been feeling well lately."

"Just unwell?" Nathaniel's voice was cool, detached.

"What else would it be?" She met his gaze evenly.

His eyes darkened as he studied her. "Evelyn, are you pregnant?"

The question caught her off guard, but she didn’t let it show. Instead, she tilted her chin up, her expression unreadable. "I don’t know where you got that idea, but no, I’m not."

A beat of silence stretched between them before Nathaniel spoke again, his tone unchanged. "Is it that you're truly not pregnant, or that you are and don’t want the child?"

Now she was certain—he didn’t know.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, keeping her voice steady. "Nathaniel, I said I’m not pregnant. Just because I came to the hospital doesn’t automatically mean that. I was having discomfort during my cycle, and the doctor suggested I rest."

"Is that so?"

"If you don’t believe me, there’s nothing I can do about it."

His gaze bore into hers, unrelenting. "Then let’s do another check-up. Together."

It wasn’t a request.

Evelyn’s fingers curled slightly at her sides, but she forced herself to relax. "Are you implying that if I refuse, it means I’m hiding something?"

Nathaniel didn’t answer, his expression unreadable.

A flicker of something—frustration, perhaps—passed over his features before he spoke again, his voice low. "You’re defensive, Evelyn. Are you afraid of what we might find?"

"What is there to be afraid of?"

"Then let’s go."

Once Nathaniel made up his mind, there was no changing it.

Evelyn pressed her lips together but didn’t resist further. If she kept refusing, he’d only grow more suspicious. She’d go along with it—for now.

Just then, Caroline rushed over, slightly out of breath. "Where are you two headed?"

Relief flickered through Evelyn at the sight of her cousin. She shrugged casually. "Nathaniel seems convinced I’m pregnant. He wants another test."

Caroline shot Nathaniel an amused look. "Mr. Martin, are you that eager for Evelyn to have your child?"

She handed over a folder. "Here are her results from earlier. I brought them down after my shift. Evelyn’s been dealing with irregular cycles—she needs rest and to avoid stress."

Nathaniel didn’t take the file, merely glancing at it. The name was Evelyn’s, the timestamp from an hour ago.

So, she really isn’t pregnant.

Disappointment flickered in his eyes before he masked it. "Evelyn, is this accurate?"

She held his gaze without flinching. "Why would I lie? Thomas was keeping an eye on me before you showed up, and Caroline had already left by then. Do you think we orchestrated fake results just for you?"

She emphasized keeping an eye, making sure her story held no gaps.

Nathaniel studied her, his expression unreadable. He had no choice but to accept it—she wasn’t pregnant. Just unwell.

When Thomas had called, Nathaniel had already prepared himself. If she was pregnant, he’d negotiate—anything to keep the child. But now, faced with the reality that it was all a misunderstanding, a hollow ache settled in his chest.

Finally, he exhaled. "If there’s no pregnancy, then fine. We only just started considering it, anyway."

Evelyn’s lips curved into a humorless smile. "Nathaniel, since when do your decisions override mine?"



###Chapter 116

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of our penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. I stretched beneath the silk sheets, my fingers brushing against the empty space beside me. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

A sigh escaped my lips as I sat up, running a hand through my tangled hair. The bed felt too large without him. Too cold.

My phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory.

"Evelyn, the client moved the meeting to 10 AM. Don’t be late."

I groaned. Another last-minute change.

Throwing the covers aside, I padded to the bathroom, the cool tiles beneath my feet a stark contrast to the warmth of the bed. The reflection in the mirror stared back at me—tired eyes, faint shadows beneath them.

When was the last time I had a full night’s sleep?

The shower did little to ease the tension coiling in my shoulders. As the water cascaded over me, my thoughts drifted to Nathaniel. Lately, it felt like we were living separate lives. He was buried in work, and I—well, I was just trying to keep up.

Dressed in a tailored navy suit, I grabbed my bag and headed out. Alfred, our butler, stood by the door, holding a steaming cup of coffee.

"For you, Mrs. Martin," he said with a polite smile.

"Bless you," I murmured, taking the cup. The rich aroma was the only thing keeping me upright.

The drive to the office was a blur of honking cars and flashing lights. By the time I arrived, my coffee was half gone, and my patience was wearing thin.

Gabrielle, my assistant, intercepted me the moment I stepped off the elevator.

"Evelyn, the client is already here," she whispered urgently.

I suppressed a groan. Of course they are.

Straightening my shoulders, I strode into the conference room, forcing a professional smile. Gregory shot me a look—half exasperation, half sympathy.

The meeting dragged on, filled with endless revisions and impossible demands. By the end of it, my temples throbbed.

As the clients filed out, Gregory lingered.

"You okay?" he asked, his voice low.

I rubbed my forehead. "Just tired."

He hesitated before speaking. "You know, if you need to talk—"

"I’m fine," I cut in, sharper than intended.

Gregory held up his hands in surrender. "Alright. Just checking."

The rest of the day passed in a haze of emails and phone calls. By the time I left the office, the sun had long since set.

The penthouse was dark when I arrived. No Nathaniel. Again.

I dropped my bag on the couch and poured myself a glass of wine, sinking into the plush cushions. The silence was deafening.

My phone buzzed—a message from Isabella.

"We need to talk."

I stared at the screen, my stomach twisting.

What now?

Observing his reaction, Evelyn realized he truly adored children.

For a fleeting moment, she considered telling him the truth—that their child already existed. She wondered how he would react.

But she dismissed the thought just as quickly.

His biggest reaction would probably be that he could give Isabella a child instead, Evelyn mused bitterly.

So she kept silent.

Nathaniel stared at her, unblinking, his expression unreadable. Just as he opened his mouth to speak, his phone rang.

Glancing at the screen, he declined the call immediately. Evelyn didn’t need to ask—she already knew who it was.

"I was planning to go out with Caroline," she said coolly. "If there’s nothing else, we’ll leave first."

Nathaniel’s grip on her wrist tightened. "When are you moving back?"

"I’m not." She frowned.

His jaw clenched, but before he could respond, his phone rang again. This time, he answered with a terse, "What?"

Evelyn tried to pull away, but he held firm.

On the other end of the line, Isabella’s voice was soft and pleading. "Nathaniel, can you come with me to my therapy session? I have an appointment, but I’m scared to go alone..."

"I’ll send Samuel."

"Please, Nathaniel. I need you there. Only you can help me remember what happened that night. Without you, I don’t think I can do this."

His expression darkened. "Fine."

"Thank you. I’ll wait for you."

Hanging up, Nathaniel turned back to Evelyn. "Isabella needs me to go with her. She’s struggling with—"

"You don’t owe me an explanation," Evelyn cut in, her voice icy. "Your relationship with Isabella is your business, not mine. You said that, remember?"

She tried to wrench her wrist free, but his grip was unrelenting.

"You’re hurting me," she hissed.

Nathaniel released her instantly, his gaze dropping to the reddened skin of her wrist. His voice was rough with frustration. "So you really don’t care what happens between Isabella and me?"

Evelyn laughed humorlessly. "Does it matter to you whether I care or not?"

The tension between them thickened. Sensing the situation escalating, Caroline quickly intervened. "Mr. Martin, Evelyn—maybe this isn’t the best place for this conversation. There are too many people around."

Nathaniel ignored her, his eyes locked onto Evelyn’s. "You moved out because you were upset about the baby. Now, as my wife, you act like you couldn’t care less about anything I do. What’s next, Evelyn? What are you planning?"

"Would you agree to whatever I want?"

"What’s that supposed to mean?"

"It means I’m tired of this," Evelyn said flatly. "You can’t let go of Isabella—you drop everything the second she calls. But then you rush over here because you’re worried I might be pregnant. Nathaniel, we should just get a divorce. Don’t you think?"



###Chapter 117

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She tapped her pen absently against the blueprint, her mind elsewhere.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Evelyn?" Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn straightened, smoothing her blouse. "Send him in."

Gregory strode in, his usual confident demeanor slightly strained. "We have a problem."

She arched a brow. "What now?"

"The Summit Realty project." He dropped a folder onto her desk. "Sebastian Wilson is pushing for revisions—again."

Evelyn flipped through the pages, her jaw tightening. "These changes aren't just adjustments. They're a complete redesign."

Gregory exhaled sharply. "I know. And he wants them by Friday."

Her fingers curled into fists. "That’s impossible."

"Tell that to Jonathan Blake. He’s been breathing down my neck all morning."

Evelyn leaned back, rubbing her temples. "Fine. I’ll handle it."

Gregory hesitated. "There’s more."

She met his gaze. "Of course there is."

"Vanessa called. Isabella’s back in town."

A cold weight settled in Evelyn’s stomach. "When?"

"Last night."

Evelyn forced a steady breath. "And Nathaniel?"

Gregory’s expression darkened. "He knows."

The air between them thickened. Evelyn turned to the window, watching the city below. The skyline blurred as her thoughts raced.

Isabella’s return was never just a coincidence.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel:

We need to talk.

Evelyn’s grip tightened around the device.

The game had just changed.

Evelyn's declaration struck Nathaniel like a lightning bolt on a clear summer day. The words hung between them, charged with an electricity that made the air crackle.

His knuckles turned white as his grip tightened on the doorframe. When he spoke, his voice was glacial. "I'll attribute this nonsense to temporary insanity. But mark my words - I won't entertain such foolishness again."

"This isn't impulse," Evelyn countered, her chin lifting defiantly. "I've been considering this since we returned to Martin Estate. Your grandfather understands. Isn't this what you've wanted all along? Your freedom? Your precious Isabella?"

Each syllable fell like a hammer blow. Charlotte, standing nearby, clutched Evelyn's wrist in silent warning, but her friend remained unmoved.

Nathaniel's lips twisted into a mirthless smile. "How convenient. Now you choose to grant my supposed wish? Where was this consideration when our grandfathers orchestrated this farce?" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Your hypocrisy astounds me, Evelyn."

Evelyn's breath hitched. Though she maintained eye contact, a storm raged behind her composed facade.

Before she could respond, Nathaniel delivered his final blow. "Understand this - the fate of our marriage was never yours alone to decide." With that, he turned on his heel and vanished down the corridor.

Evelyn stood frozen, watching the space where he'd been until Charlotte's concerned touch broke her trance. "Don't let him rattle you. You know how he gets when cornered."

"I'm fine," Evelyn lied smoothly, straightening her blouse. "Let's take that walk. I intend to enjoy my half-day off properly - starting with an early return home."

Meanwhile, Nathaniel stormed through the hospital corridors, bypassing Isabella's ward entirely. Instead, he summoned Samuel with a clipped command. "Escort Ms. Davis to her therapy session. Document every word, every reaction. I want transcripts by tonight."

"Yes, sir."

Nathaniel powered off his phone, craving silence. But when Samuel arrived at Isabella's penthouse, her reaction was volcanic.

"I want Nathaniel! He promised!" she shrieked, her manicured nails digging into the doorframe.

Samuel remained impassive. "Mr. Martin is occupied. I'm to ensure you reach your appointment."

"Get out!" Isabella slammed the door with enough force to rattle nearby paintings. "Know your place, you glorified errand boy!"

Alone, Isabella dialed Nathaniel repeatedly, growing more frantic with each unanswered call. When the automated voicemail greeted her yet again, she hurled her phone across the room. "This is Evelyn's doing," she hissed to the empty apartment. "That scheming witch is poisoning him against me."
###Chapter 118

The moment Nathaniel stepped into the room, Evelyn felt the air shift. His presence was magnetic, commanding attention without a single word. She had spent the entire afternoon preparing for this meeting, yet now, under his piercing gaze, her carefully rehearsed speech evaporated.

"You wanted to discuss the project?" Nathaniel’s voice was smooth, but there was an edge to it—something unreadable.

Evelyn straightened her shoulders. "Yes. The timeline Summit Realty proposed is unrealistic. We need at least another month to ensure structural integrity."

Nathaniel’s expression remained impassive, but his fingers tapped lightly against the polished mahogany desk. "Sebastian won’t like that."

"I don’t care what Sebastian likes," Evelyn countered, her voice steady. "This isn’t about pleasing him—it’s about safety."

A flicker of something—approval? amusement?—passed through Nathaniel’s eyes. "You’re not afraid to push back, are you?"

Evelyn met his gaze squarely. "Not when it matters."

Silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken tension. Then, unexpectedly, Nathaniel leaned forward. "Fine. I’ll handle Sebastian. But there’s a condition."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. "What condition?"

"You oversee the adjustments personally. No delegating."

She hesitated. That meant more time working directly with him—more late nights, more meetings where his presence alone threatened to unravel her composure. But she couldn’t refuse. Not when the project was at stake.

"Deal," she said.

Nathaniel’s lips curved into a slow, knowing smile. "Good."

As Evelyn turned to leave, his voice stopped her at the door. "Oh, and Evelyn?"

She glanced back.

"Wear something comfortable tomorrow. We’re visiting the site at dawn."

Her breath caught. A site visit? Just the two of them?

Before she could respond, Nathaniel’s phone rang, and he dismissed her with a casual wave. But as she stepped into the hallway, Evelyn couldn’t shake the feeling that this was more than just business.

Something had shifted between them.

And she wasn’t sure if she was ready for what came next.

The next day, Evelyn couldn't reach Nathaniel at all. With every passing hour, the unsettling feeling in her chest grew heavier, twisting into something cold and unfamiliar.

By 10 p.m., Nathaniel lounged in the dimly lit private room of the club, swirling a glass of whiskey in his hand. Thomas had just finished his obligations and hurried over to update him on Evelyn’s situation.

"Mr. Martin," Thomas began, his voice cautious, "Evelyn refused to let me accompany her to the therapist. She insisted on having you there. She probably tried calling you earlier."

Nathaniel dismissed him with a flick of his wrist.

Once the door clicked shut behind Thomas, Sebastian—who had been watching with half-lidded amusement—leaned forward. "What’s really going on between you and Evelyn? Why is this still so messy?"

Silence.

Sebastian exhaled a slow stream of smoke before pressing further. "Nathaniel, what’s your plan? Even if Isabella went for a check-up today, who’s to say she won’t be pregnant next month? Would you still keep Evelyn around if that happened?"

A cold laugh escaped Nathaniel’s lips. "Pregnant?" His voice was dangerously calm. "Do you know what she told me today? She said I could try to get her pregnant, but she’d find a way to rid herself of it. If she’s capable of saying that, what else is she capable of?"

Sebastian’s brows shot up. If Theodore and Dominic were here, they’d choke on their drinks.

Nathaniel sounded like a man scorned.

Stubbing out his cigarette, Sebastian lit another one, smirking. "So now you want a child, and she doesn’t?"

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened, his gaze distant.

Sebastian tilted his head. "Then what’s the deal between you two? She used to be so devoted, so tender with you. Why does it feel like she’s changed since you mentioned divorce?"

A scoff. "She brought up divorce first—claimed it was for both our sakes. Everything before was just an act."

Sebastian fell quiet, considering.

After a moment, he spoke carefully. "Nathaniel, have you ever considered that maybe Evelyn was genuinely gentle with you before? That she’s only become this cold and rational because of your unresolved ties with Isabella? That maybe… she’s hurt?"

"Hurt?" Nathaniel’s laugh was sharp.

He leaned forward, eyes glinting with something dark. "Do you really think she’s the type to get hurt? I’d bet she’s more eager than anyone to end this marriage."

Sebastian shook his head. "There’s a reason. You’ve been married for a year, and she never mentioned divorce before. It’s only because you started it, and Isabella’s always hovering. Put yourself in her shoes—how would you feel? She’s probably just done."

"No," Nathaniel cut in, his voice icy. "That’s not it."

His expression hardened as he delivered the final blow.

"There’s someone else in her heart."

Sebastian nearly dropped his drink. "Evelyn is in love with someone else?"

What kind of twisted marriage is this?

Are they both chasing other people?



###Chapter 119

The moment Nathaniel stepped into the dimly lit study, the weight of his grandfather's gaze settled heavily upon him. Edward Martin sat behind the mahogany desk, his gnarled fingers steepled beneath his chin, eyes sharp despite his advanced age.

"You're late," Edward remarked, voice gravelly with disapproval.

Nathaniel exhaled through his nose, loosening his tie. "Traffic was worse than expected."

A lie. He'd stalled outside the estate gates for ten minutes, dreading this conversation.

Edward's lips thinned. "Sit."

Nathaniel obeyed, sinking into the leather chair opposite his grandfather. The scent of aged whiskey and polished wood filled the air, familiar yet suffocating.

"I've reviewed the quarterly reports," Edward began, sliding a folder across the desk. "Your numbers are acceptable. But acceptable isn't exceptional."

Nathaniel resisted the urge to roll his eyes. "The market's volatile right now. We're outperforming competitors by—"

"I didn't call you here to listen to excuses." Edward's cane thumped against the floor. "The board expects innovation. Vision. Not complacency."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. He'd spent sleepless nights restructuring departments, securing new contracts—all while managing the fallout from Isabella's sudden reappearance. But Edward would never acknowledge that.

A knock interrupted them. Winston, Edward's ever-loyal butler, entered with a silver tray bearing two crystal glasses and a decanter of amber liquid.

"Your medication, sir," Winston murmured, setting the tray down.

Edward waved him off impatiently. "Later."

Winston hesitated, casting a concerned glance at Nathaniel before retreating.

Silence stretched between them. Nathaniel studied his grandfather—the deepening wrinkles, the tremor in his left hand. Time was chipping away at the indomitable Edward Martin. The realization should have brought satisfaction. Instead, it left a hollow ache in Nathaniel's chest.

Edward poured two fingers of whiskey, pushing one glass toward Nathaniel. "Your father lacked discipline. Don't repeat his mistakes."

The words landed like a physical blow. Nathaniel's fingers curled around the glass, knuckles whitening. Richard Martin's failures haunted this family like ghosts.

"I'm nothing like him," Nathaniel ground out.

Edward smirked, raising his drink. "Prove it."

The whiskey burned going down, but Nathaniel welcomed the fire. He'd spent his life proving himself—to Edward, to the board, to everyone who doubted a Martin could rebuild their empire.

His phone buzzed in his pocket. Evelyn's name flashed across the screen.

We need to talk.

Nathaniel's stomach dropped. She'd been distant since the gala, withdrawing into her work. He'd assumed she needed space after Isabella's dramatic scene. Now, uncertainty gnawed at him.

Edward noticed his distraction. "Problem?"

Nathaniel pocketed the phone. "Nothing I can't handle."

"See that you do." Edward leaned forward, eyes glinting. "The Martins don't tolerate weakness. Not in business. Not in marriage."

Ice slithered down Nathaniel's spine. Did Edward know about Isabella's threats? About the tabloids sniffing around their past?

Before he could respond, Winston reappeared, this time with urgency lining his features. "Sir, Mr. Prescott is on line one. He insists it's urgent."

Edward scowled but reached for the phone. "This isn't over."

Nathaniel stood, grateful for the reprieve. He needed air. Needed to figure out what the hell Evelyn wanted to discuss.

As he strode toward the door, Edward's parting words followed him:

"Remember, boy—legacies aren't inherited. They're earned."

The heavy oak door clicked shut behind him, but Nathaniel couldn't shake the sensation of chains tightening around his throat.

Outside, twilight painted the gardens in shades of violet and gold. Nathaniel pulled out his phone, staring at Evelyn's message. Three words that could unravel everything.

His thumb hovered over the call button when a sleek black sedan pulled up the driveway. The window rolled down, revealing Isabella's smirking face.

"Going my way, darling?"

Nathaniel's grip on the phone turned lethal. "What the hell are you doing here?"

Isabella's crimson lips curved. "Saving you from yourself."

The passenger door swung open.

"Get in," she purred. "We have so much to discuss."

Wind rustled through the hedges, carrying the scent of impending rain. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rumbled.

A storm was coming.

And Nathaniel stood directly in its path.

"It's her former lover. She only married me back then to push that man away."

Nathaniel slumped into the leather couch, downing his whiskey in one bitter gulp. The thought gnawed at him, twisting his insides with frustration.

She swore she had moved on. Claimed she never looked back. Then why demand a divorce now?

If it were really about Isabella, why didn’t she care from the start?

Lies. All of it.

His mood darkened further. "Every word out of her mouth is just an excuse to run back to him."

Thomas raised an eyebrow. "Have you ever met this guy?"

"No."

And he never wanted to.

Thomas swirled his drink thoughtfully. "We should look into him. What kind of man could make a woman like Evelyn—gorgeous, brilliant—hold onto him for years?"

Nathaniel shot him a glare sharp enough to cut glass.

Thomas held up his hands. "Just saying—women like her don’t pine for just anyone. If she’s still hung up on him, he’s either a saint or a master manipulator. And let’s be honest, stunning women? Terrible taste in men."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. He drained another glass without reply.

But Thomas’s words stuck like a thorn. Was Evelyn being played?

The silence stretched. Thomas refilled his glass, watching as Nathaniel drank himself into a haze.

By midnight, Nathaniel’s movements had slowed, his speech slurring. Thomas, still sharp, seized the moment.

"Do you actually love Isabella?"

"What does it matter?"

"If not, why keep her around? Guilt? Because she took that hit for you and ended up in a coma?"

"Some things aren’t that simple," Nathaniel muttered.

Thomas leaned in. "Listen. If you want to save your marriage, cut Isabella off—completely. Pay her off, set her up with a career, but let her go. If you’d rather be with her, then stop dragging Evelyn through this. Clean break. Better for everyone."

Nathaniel stared into his glass. Minutes passed before he finally spoke, voice rough.

"Clean breaks don’t exist."

Thomas sighed.

Later, as bouncers hauled Nathaniel into the backseat, Thomas gave the driver an address with a smirk.

"Consider this a favor, old friend."

The car pulled up thirty minutes later—not at the Martin estate, but outside Evelyn’s apartment.

"The Marriage Game" (Evelyn & Nathaniel) – A Novel of Love and Second Chances
###Chapter 120

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

She sighed, sitting up and running a hand through her tousled hair. The weight of their recent arguments pressed heavily on her chest. Ever since Isabella had reappeared in their lives, everything had become… complicated.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory.

"Evelyn, the client wants revisions by noon. They’re pushing for a more modern aesthetic."

She groaned. Another last-minute change.

Downstairs, Alfred had prepared her usual coffee—black, no sugar. The rich aroma filled the kitchen, but even that couldn’t lift her mood.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin," Alfred greeted, his tone as composed as ever.

"Morning," she murmured, taking a sip.

The silence stretched between them, thick and uncomfortable.

"Mr. Martin left early," Alfred offered, as if sensing her thoughts. "He mentioned an urgent meeting."

Evelyn nodded, though she knew better. Nathaniel had been distant lately, his excuses growing flimsier by the day.

Her phone buzzed again—this time, a notification from a gossip site.

"Isabella Davis Spotted Leaving Martin Group Headquarters—What Does This Mean for the Power Couple?"

Her grip on the coffee cup tightened.

Just then, the front door opened, and Nathaniel strode in, his expression unreadable.

"You're back early," Evelyn remarked, her voice carefully neutral.

He hesitated, then sighed. "We need to talk."

Her stomach twisted. Those words never led anywhere good.

"About what?"

His gaze flickered to her phone, still displaying the headline. His jaw clenched.

"About Isabella."

Evelyn set her cup down with deliberate calm. "What about her?"

Nathaniel ran a hand through his hair, frustration evident. "It’s not what you think."

"Then enlighten me."

He exhaled sharply. "She’s working on a project with the company. That’s all."

Evelyn arched a brow. "And the press just happened to catch her leaving your office?"

"It’s business, Evelyn."

"Funny how your business always involves her."

The tension between them crackled, neither willing to back down.

Before he could respond, his phone rang. He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening.

"I have to take this."

She watched as he stepped away, his voice low and urgent.

Alfred cleared his throat. "Shall I prepare breakfast, Mrs. Martin?"

Evelyn shook her head. "No, thank you. I’ve lost my appetite."

She grabbed her bag and headed for the door, her mind racing. If Nathaniel thought she’d just stand by while Isabella weaved her way back into their lives, he had another thing coming.

As she stepped outside, the crisp morning air did little to cool her simmering anger.

This wasn’t over. Not by a long shot.

The clock had long since struck midnight, wrapping the world in a hushed silence.

Thomas and the chauffeur carefully guided Nathaniel out of the car, steadying him as they made their way toward the elevator.

Nathaniel, his head spinning, rasped out, "This isn't Pineview Villa."

Thomas smirked. "Planning to spend the night alone, are we?"

Nathaniel scowled. "None of your damn business."

"Fine, not my problem. Want me to take you back?" Thomas pressed the elevator button, having already memorized the details—18th floor, Apartment 101.

Half a minute later, the elevator doors slid open. Thomas maneuvered Nathaniel to the front door and rang the bell, glancing at his friend with amusement. "Whether she opens this door decides your fate."

The next second, the door swung inward.

A drowsy Evelyn blinked at the two men standing before her.

Thomas spoke first. "Evelyn, sorry to bother you so late. Nathaniel had a few too many drinks and wouldn’t stop asking for you. Had no choice but to bring him here."

Nathaniel slumped against him, silent and unresponsive.

Evelyn frowned. "We're separated now. Didn’t he tell you?"

At the sound of her voice, Nathaniel’s eyes fluttered open, locking onto her with an unfocused gaze.

Thomas shrugged. "Evelyn, it’s late, and I’m exhausted. Just let him crash here tonight. He can leave on his own tomorrow, alright?"

Without waiting for her reply, he nudged Nathaniel inside.

Evelyn instinctively stepped back, a protective hand hovering over her belly.

Thomas deposited Nathaniel onto the sofa, where he sprawled motionless. "There you go. I’ll leave you to it. Get some rest."

"Wait—" Evelyn’s protest was cut short as Thomas strode out, shutting the door behind him.

She exhaled sharply, then turned her attention to the man on her couch. "Nathaniel, are you awake?"

A low, rough hum was his only response.

Evelyn approached, crouching beside him. "Should I call Samuel to pick you up?"

Though they were still legally married, they stood on the precipice of divorce.

Once a decision was made, hesitation only bred weakness.

Evelyn feared his presence would unravel her resolve.

The mere thought of staying married—of her child calling Isabella "Mom"—sent a cold wave of dread through her.

Nathaniel remained silent. Evelyn reached into his coat pocket, retrieving his phone. The screen was unlocked, and she quickly dialed Samuel’s number.

Despite the late hour, Samuel answered immediately.

"Samuel, it’s Evelyn. Could you come to my apartment? Nathaniel’s had too much to drink. I need you to—"

Before she could finish, the phone was yanked from her grasp. Nathaniel’s voice, thick with alcohol, growled, "Get lost."

Then he hurled the phone across the room.

Evelyn’s frown deepened. "What the hell was that for?"

"What are you doing?" Nathaniel shot back.

He lay half-propped on the sofa, eyes narrowed, his breath heavy with the scent of whiskey.



###Chapter 121

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She traced the sharp line of his jaw with her fingertips, marveling at how peaceful he looked.

A soft knock interrupted the quiet.

"Mrs. Martin?" Alfred's voice was muffled through the door. "Mr. Edward has requested your presence in the study."

Evelyn frowned. Edward rarely summoned her directly. Something must be urgent.

"I'll be right there," she replied, slipping out of bed.

Nathaniel stirred, his arm reaching out instinctively. "Where are you going?" His voice was rough with sleep.

"Your grandfather wants to see me," she said, pressing a quick kiss to his forehead. "Go back to sleep."

His grip tightened briefly before he let her go.

Downstairs, the study door was slightly ajar. Evelyn hesitated before knocking.

"Come in," Edward's voice rang out.

She stepped inside to find him seated behind his massive oak desk, his expression unreadable. Winston stood beside him, hands clasped behind his back.

"You wanted to see me?" Evelyn asked.

Edward gestured to the chair opposite him. "Sit."

She obeyed, her pulse quickening.

"I received an interesting call this morning," he began, steepling his fingers. "From Isabella Davis."

Evelyn's breath hitched. Isabella—Nathaniel's ex, the woman who had nearly destroyed their marriage.

"What did she want?" Evelyn forced her voice to remain steady.

Edward's gaze sharpened. "She claims to have information that could damage the Martin family's reputation. Specifically, regarding Nathaniel."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. "What kind of information?"

"That," Edward said slowly, "is what I need you to find out."

Her stomach twisted. "Me?"

"You have a way of handling these situations discreetly," he said. "And Nathaniel trusts you."

Evelyn swallowed hard. This was a test—one she couldn't afford to fail.

"I'll handle it," she said firmly.

Edward nodded, satisfied. "Good. Keep me updated."

As she left the study, Evelyn's mind raced. What could Isabella possibly know? And more importantly—how far would she go to use it against them?

The game had just gotten more dangerous.

Evelyn's expression turned icy as silence stretched between them. She stood abruptly, intending to retreat to the sanctuary of her bedroom, leaving Nathaniel to his drunken stupor.

But before she could take a single step, his fingers closed around her wrist like a vice. His voice, rough with intoxication, murmured, "Evelyn, we're still married. That means half of this apartment is mine."

She exhaled sharply, frustration simmering beneath her skin. "Nathaniel, be reasonable. I rented this place with my own money."

His grip tightened slightly. "Do you hate me?" His voice was low, almost wounded. "Why are you so desperate to end things?"

The question froze her in place. Her pulse stuttered, an unfamiliar ache flaring in her chest.

Hate him?

The truth was far more dangerous. She had chosen to leave precisely because she feared she couldn't hate him.

Yet here he was—the one who had demanded the divorce—now refusing to let go.

She swallowed hard, forcing her emotions down.

Her silence seemed to provoke him. Without warning, he yanked her into his arms.

Evelyn gasped, instinctively pressing a protective hand to her abdomen as she struggled. "Nathaniel, what are you doing?"

But he held her tighter, his drunken strength making resistance futile. His breath was warm against her ear, sending an involuntary shiver down her spine.

"Answer me," he demanded, voice rough. "Do you hate me?"

"No."

"You're lying."

She clenched her jaw. "If you won't believe me, then there's nothing I can do."

His fingers dug into her waist, his words slurring slightly. "You wouldn't even take care of me when I was drunk. Just handed me off to someone else. That's cold, Evelyn. I'm still your husband."

She exhaled sharply. "Let go. I'll make you something to sober up."

His laugh was humorless. "I don't trust you."

He wasn't wrong. She hadn't stocked her kitchen with hangover remedies.

They were at a standstill—his grip unrelenting, her patience thinning. The pressure on her waist would surely leave bruises.

Evelyn gritted her teeth. "What do you want from me, Nathaniel? It's late. We both have work tomorrow. We can talk when you're sober."

Instead of answering, he buried his face in the crook of her neck, his breath scorching against her skin. She stiffened, but he only pulled her closer, leaving no space between them.

Finally, he muttered, "I want a bath. Draw one for me."

She hesitated, but he shifted restlessly, his fingers tightening in silent warning. Reluctantly, she nodded.

Yet even as she led him to the bathroom, he refused to release her hand.

Evelyn turned on the faucet, adjusting the temperature before setting out fresh towels and soap within his reach. When she turned back, his gaze was locked onto her—dark, intense, and utterly unreadable.

The steam curled between them, softening the sharp lines of his face. Even disheveled, he was unfairly handsome.

She looked away first. "It's ready. Call if you need anything."

She tried to pull free, but his fingers tangled with hers. His voice dropped to a whisper.

"Help me."
###Chapter 122

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady and deep. She traced the curve of his jaw with her fingertips, marveling at how peaceful he looked.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory Wilson, her business partner, flashed on the screen: "Emergency meeting at the office. Summit Realty is making moves."

Evelyn frowned. Summit Realty had been a thorn in their side for months, and Sebastian Wilson, its ruthless CEO, was relentless. She slipped out of bed quietly, careful not to disturb Nathaniel.

Downstairs, Alfred, their butler, had already prepared her coffee. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin. Will you be having breakfast before you leave?"

"No time, Alfred," she said, grabbing her briefcase. "Tell Nathaniel I’ll call him later."

The drive to the office was tense. Her mind raced with possibilities—what could Summit Realty be planning now?

When she arrived, Gregory was pacing in the conference room, his expression grim. "They’ve undercut our bid for the waterfront project," he said without preamble. "Jonathan Blake just sent over the revised proposal. It’s a direct challenge."

Evelyn clenched her fists. "They can’t just steal our clients."

Gabrielle, her assistant, hurried in with a tablet. "I pulled their financials. They’ve got backing from an unknown investor—someone with deep pockets."

Evelyn’s phone buzzed again. A message from Charlotte Bennett, her best friend: "You need to see this." Attached was a grainy photo of Sebastian Wilson meeting with Donovan Sinclair in a dimly lit bar.

Her blood ran cold. Donovan was trouble—a man with connections to the underworld. If Summit Realty was working with him, this was more than just business rivalry.

Just then, Nathaniel called. His voice was sharp with concern. "Evelyn, where are you? We need to talk."

She hesitated. "I’m at the office. What’s wrong?"

"Edward just called an emergency board meeting. He’s pushing for immediate action against Summit Realty."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. The stakes were rising. "I’ll be there soon."

As she hung up, Gregory met her gaze. "This is getting dangerous."

She nodded. "Then we fight back harder."

The game had just changed. And Evelyn wasn’t about to lose.

"Nathaniel, stop this nonsense right now."

Evelyn crossed her arms, her irritation evident in the tight line of her lips. The man before her hesitated, his chiseled features twisting with visible frustration. He tilted his head slightly, his dark eyes locking onto hers with an intensity that sent an unexpected shiver down her spine.

"Help me," he murmured, his voice a velvet whisper that curled around her like smoke.

The request caught her off guard. Evelyn had already been in bed when Nathaniel arrived, dressed in nothing but soft cotton pajamas. Yet even in such simple attire, she glowed—her skin luminous under the dim bathroom light, her tousled hair framing her face in loose waves.

She exhaled sharply, squeezing her eyes shut as a familiar warmth pooled in her chest.

Before she could respond, Nathaniel’s hands shot out, gripping her waist and yanking her straight into the bathtub with him. Water sloshed over the edges as she gasped, her clothes instantly drenched.

"Since you won’t help," he murmured, his lips brushing her ear, "we’ll just bathe together."

Evelyn sputtered, shoving against his chest. "Have you lost your mind?"

Nathaniel merely smirked, lounging back as if this were perfectly normal. Seething, she scrambled out of the tub, water dripping from her clothes as she stormed out of the bathroom.

She was furious. His audacity had shattered her resolve, yet he remained utterly oblivious, wrapped up in his own whims.

Regret burned through her. She never should have let him in. She should have slammed the door in his face the moment he showed up.

Cheeks flaming, she retreated to her room, stripping off her soaked pajamas and tugging on dry ones. Enough was enough. She wasn’t indulging him any further.

With a sharp click, she locked her bedroom door and threw herself onto the bed.

But sleep refused to come. No matter how many deep breaths she took, Nathaniel’s face kept flashing behind her eyelids—his smirk, his damp hair clinging to his forehead, the way his voice had dropped to that sinful whisper.

It was infuriating.

Eventually, exhaustion pulled her under, but her rest was short-lived. She jolted awake hours later, disoriented. Fumbling for her phone, she squinted at the screen—5:30 AM.

A sudden thought struck her.

She bolted upright, hurrying out of her room. The living room was empty. Her stomach twisted.

Then she turned toward the bathroom.

Her breath caught.

Nathaniel was still there, slumped against the edge of the tub, half-submerged in water that had long gone cold. His eyes were closed, his breathing slow.

Panic flared. She rushed forward, pressing her fingers to the water. Ice-cold.

"Nathaniel!" She shook his shoulder. "Wake up!"

No response.

He couldn’t stay like this. He’d freeze. Desperate, she pinched his nose. "Nathaniel, I swear—"

He swatted her hand away, groggy and disoriented.

"Let me help you up," she insisted. "You can’t sleep here."

Still nothing.

Gritting her teeth, she pinched his nose again, harder this time. After several attempts, he finally grunted in protest, blinking up at her with bleary eyes.

She guided him to the bedroom, steering him toward a chair. "Take off your clothes," she ordered. "You’ll soak the sheets."

"No."

He made a move toward the bed, but Evelyn blocked him. "You’ll get sick. If you don’t listen, I’m calling Samuel to come get you."

Nathaniel stilled. Then, with a heavy sigh, he met her gaze.

"Fine," he muttered. "Help me."
###Chapter 123

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the design—a new luxury resort for the Martin Group. The project was her biggest yet, and the weight of responsibility settled heavily on her shoulders.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Evelyn?" Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in, holding a steaming cup of coffee. "Thought you might need this. You've been staring at those plans for hours."

Evelyn smiled gratefully, accepting the cup. "Thanks, Gabrielle. Just trying to perfect the layout before the client meeting."

Gabrielle hesitated, then lowered her voice. "Nathaniel called earlier. He said he’d be late tonight—another meeting with the board."

Evelyn’s grip tightened slightly on the cup. Lately, Nathaniel had been buried in work, their time together dwindling. She understood the pressure he was under, but the distance between them was growing, and it unsettled her.

"I see," she murmured, forcing a smile. "Tell him not to worry. I’ll probably be working late too."

Gabrielle nodded sympathetically before slipping out.

Evelyn exhaled, turning back to her designs. But her focus was shattered when her phone buzzed—an unknown number flashing on the screen.

Curious, she answered. "Evelyn Mitchell."

"Isabella Davis," the smooth, confident voice replied. "I think we should talk."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Isabella—Nathaniel’s ex, the woman who had once held his heart. Why was she calling now?

"About what?" Evelyn kept her tone neutral, though her pulse quickened.

Isabella’s laugh was light, almost mocking. "Oh, just a little… family matter. Meet me at The Velvet Lounge. Tonight. Eight o’clock."

Before Evelyn could respond, the line went dead.

She stared at her phone, unease coiling in her stomach. What did Isabella want? And why did it feel like a storm was brewing beneath the surface of her carefully constructed life?

Setting the phone down, Evelyn clenched her fists. Whatever game Isabella was playing, she wouldn’t let it shake her. But as she glanced at the clock, counting the hours until their meeting, one thought echoed in her mind:

Nothing good ever comes from the past resurfacing.

Evelyn hesitated, her brows knitting together as she studied Nathaniel. The memory of the bathtub incident was still vivid, making her refuse instinctively. "I'll call Samuel."

She reached for her phone, but before she could dial, Nathaniel's fingers moved to the buttons of his shirt. One by one, they popped open, the soft clicks echoing as the fabric slid off his shoulders and pooled at his feet.

Her gaze flickered over his sculpted torso—the defined muscles, the droplets of water still clinging to his skin, the way his damp hair framed his sharp features. It was undeniably alluring, a sight that would make anyone’s breath hitch.

Evelyn cleared her throat and averted her eyes, half-convinced he’d done it on purpose.

With a quiet sigh, Nathaniel sank into the warmth of the covers, shifting slightly before his breathing evened out into sleep.

Rolling her eyes, Evelyn turned up the heater before slipping into bed beside him.

They’d shared this space for nearly a year now—had done far more intimate things than simply sleeping side by side. There was no reason for her to retreat to the couch tonight.

But she regretted that decision almost immediately.

Just as she was drifting off, Nathaniel’s arm snaked around her waist, pulling her flush against him. His grip was firm, unyielding, as if he had no intention of letting go.

When his breathing steadied, she tried to pry his hand away—only for him to tighten his hold seconds later, his voice rough with sleep.

"Stay still."

Evelyn froze.

Was he actually awake?

She managed a few more hours of restless sleep before her alarm blared at eight sharp. Today, she had plans to visit the construction site, so skipping the office wasn’t an issue. But Nathaniel remained motionless beside her, his breathing deep.

"Nathaniel?" she whispered.

He shifted slightly but didn’t respond.

Frowning, she reached out to nudge him—only to jerk her hand back the second her fingers brushed his skin.

He was burning up.

"Nathaniel!" She shook him harder this time, but he only groaned, his voice thick with exhaustion.

"Leave me alone."

Evelyn scrambled out of bed, grabbing the medical kit Caroline had insisted she keep for emergencies. The thermometer beeped after what felt like an eternity, confirming her fears—102°F.

"You’re running a fever," she said, her voice tight. "We need to get you to the hospital."

Nathaniel barely stirred. "I’ll be fine after some sleep."

His words were sluggish, his body weak. It had been years since he’d last been sick, and now it had hit him like a truck.

Guilt twisted in Evelyn’s chest. She shouldn’t have left him alone in the bath last night.

After a quick call to Gabrielle to rearrange her schedule, she ordered medicine and whipped up a simple soup. By the time the delivery arrived, Nathaniel had barely moved.

She coaxed him upright, forcing the pills and broth down his throat. Since he had no spare clothes here, she’d ordered two plain T-shirts—though even those looked unfairly expensive on him.

Once the medicine kicked in, some color returned to his face. Evelyn pressed a hand to his forehead.

"You should still see a doctor."



###Chapter 124

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort in the Maldives. The design was ambitious, but she thrived on challenges.

A knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn nodded. "Send him in."

Gregory strode in, his usual confident demeanor slightly frayed at the edges. "We have a problem," he said without preamble.

Evelyn arched a brow. "What kind of problem?"

"The client wants major revisions. Again." He dropped a folder onto her desk. "They’re insisting on a complete redesign of the central pavilion."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "They approved the plans last week."

Gregory shrugged. "Apparently, they changed their minds after seeing a competitor’s project."

She flipped open the folder, scanning the notes. The changes were extensive—and unreasonable. "This isn’t just a revision. It’s starting from scratch."

"I know." Gregory ran a hand through his hair. "But they’re threatening to pull out if we don’t comply."

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. This client had been difficult from the start, but the contract was lucrative. Losing it would hurt the firm.

She tapped her pen against the desk. "Tell them we’ll review their requests, but we need a formal meeting to discuss feasibility and timeline."

Gregory nodded. "I’ll set it up."

As he turned to leave, Evelyn added, "And Gregory? Make it clear that additional changes will incur extra costs."

A smirk tugged at his lips. "Will do."

The moment the door closed, Evelyn leaned back in her chair, exhaling slowly. The weight of the situation pressed on her shoulders. She needed a distraction.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel:

Dinner tonight? I have something to tell you.

Her pulse quickened. Nathaniel had been unusually secretive lately. She typed a quick reply:

Sounds serious. Should I be worried?

His response came instantly:

Not worried. Just… important.

Evelyn chewed her lip. Important could mean anything—good or bad.

Before she could dwell on it, another message popped up—this time from Charlotte:

Emergency girls’ night. My place. 8 PM. No excuses.

Evelyn chuckled. Charlotte’s "emergencies" usually involved wine and gossip. Still, it was exactly what she needed.

She replied: I’ll be there.

As she set her phone down, her gaze drifted back to the blueprints. The resort project was a mess, Nathaniel was being cryptic, and Charlotte was summoning her for an impromptu therapy session.

Just another day in the life of Evelyn Mitchell.

She smiled to herself.

Bring it on.

Nathaniel was burning up with fever after being drenched for hours. His head spun, making it impossible to think straight. He fixed his bleary gaze on Evelyn and muttered, "I'm not going to the hospital."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "If you don’t get treated, this fever could make you delirious. Is that what you want?"

"Why am I even sick?" he demanded.

Guilt twisted Evelyn’s stomach, leaving her silent.

Nathaniel’s lips curled into a weak smirk. "This fever is your fault, so you’re responsible for taking care of me until it’s gone. Evelyn, we’re still married. It’s your duty. Don’t you agree?"

She exhaled sharply but couldn’t argue.

Nathaniel refused to leave, and Evelyn couldn’t force him out.

It was her mistake, after all. She hadn’t planned on letting him stay, let alone inviting him into her apartment. But once he’d shown up drunk and vulnerable, some stubborn sense of obligation took hold.

Her silence seemed to satisfy Nathaniel. He spent the morning dozing, and the apartment remained peaceful.

By lunchtime, Evelyn had prepared two simple dishes—grilled steak and creamy pumpkin soup.

They sat across from each other at the small dining table. Nathaniel eyed the food. It looked surprisingly good—homely and warm, despite its simplicity.

Noticing his scrutiny, Evelyn tensed. "The fridge was nearly empty. If it’s not to your taste, I can order something else."

"Did you make this?" Nathaniel’s deep voice cut through her thoughts.

She nodded. "You should eat something light while you’re sick."

Then she dug in, her stomach growling after a sleepless night and busy morning.

Nathaniel said nothing else. He picked up his spoon and tasted the soup. It was… surprisingly decent.

A flicker of surprise crossed his face. He set the spoon down. "When did you learn to cook? After leaving the mansion?"

Evelyn glanced up. "No. I had to figure it out during college when I was living alone."

"Did the Mitchells not take care of you back then?"

Nathaniel rarely asked about her past, especially her life before their marriage.

Evelyn paused. It was unexpected, but the memories no longer stung. Her voice was even. "It doesn’t matter. That’s all in the past."

Nathaniel studied her, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn didn’t elaborate. Once they finished eating, she cleared the dishes.

Then Nathaniel held out his hand. "Give me your phone."

His own had been destroyed—by his own doing.

Evelyn handed it over, and he dialed Samuel. "Bring me a change of clothes to Evelyn’s apartment. And my laptop. I’ll be working remotely for the next few days."

Samuel had been reeling since last night. He’d considered calling back, but Nathaniel’s furious "Get lost!" had stopped him.

Now, hearing Nathaniel’s voice on Evelyn’s phone didn’t shock him half as much as the idea of Nathaniel working from home.

"Mr. Martin," Samuel ventured carefully, "is everything alright?"

"Samuel," Nathaniel said coolly, "since when do you question me?"

Samuel swallowed. "Right away, sir."

Nathaniel ended the call.

Evelyn frowned. "Why are you having Samuel bring you clothes?"
###Chapter 125

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, her breath caught in her throat. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the marble floors, and the scent of fresh roses filled the air. But it wasn’t the opulence that unsettled her—it was the weight of the unspoken tension.

Nathaniel stood by the fireplace, his broad shoulders rigid, his expression unreadable. His fingers tightened around the crystal glass in his hand as he turned to face her.

"You came," he said, his voice low.

Evelyn forced a smile, though her pulse raced. "You asked me to."

A beat of silence stretched between them, heavy with everything left unsaid. The last time they had spoken, words had been sharp as knives, leaving wounds that hadn’t yet healed.

Then, footsteps echoed down the hall.

Isabella appeared, her crimson dress swaying with each graceful step. She stopped beside Nathaniel, her hand brushing his arm in a gesture that was far too familiar.

"Evelyn," she greeted, her smile polished and practiced. "I didn’t expect to see you here."

Evelyn’s fingers curled into her palms. "Neither did I."

Nathaniel’s jaw tensed, his gaze flickering between them. The air thickened with unspoken accusations, old betrayals simmering beneath the surface.

Before anyone could speak again, Alfred, the butler, entered with a tray of champagne. "Mr. Martin requests your presence in the study," he announced.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, then set his glass down. "Excuse me."

As he walked away, Isabella lingered, her eyes glinting with something Evelyn couldn’t decipher.

"You always did have a way of complicating things," she murmured, before following Nathaniel.

Evelyn stood frozen, the words cutting deeper than she cared to admit.

Then, a hand touched her shoulder.

"Don’t let her get to you," Caroline whispered, appearing beside her. "She’s just trying to provoke you."

Evelyn swallowed hard. "I know."

But knowing didn’t make it hurt any less.

Across the room, Edward Martin watched the exchange with sharp eyes. His presence was a silent storm, his disapproval palpable.

And somewhere in the shadows, Vanessa lurked, her phone recording every moment.

The game was far from over.

And Evelyn?

She was right in the middle of it.

"I'll be staying here until my fever breaks," Nathaniel declared, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "So you're not even going to ask? Just making decisions without my input now?"

The audacity of this man!

She exhaled sharply, exhaustion creeping in.

Nathaniel's voice softened, though his words remained calculated. "Evelyn, the fever hasn't subsided. Are you really going to send me back alone? What if I collapse in the middle of the night with no one around? Or do you think a severe infection isn't worth worrying about? If that's the case, I'll leave now. I know I'm disturbing your peace. I'm sure Grandfather won't blame you, even if he finds out the reason."

"Enough," Evelyn snapped, cutting him off. She couldn't take his dramatics anymore.

It's just a fever. It's not like he's dying.

Besides, Pineview Villa wasn't empty—Alfred and the staff were there.

But arguing was pointless. If he wanted to stay, fine. It was her apartment, after all.

She grabbed her phone and retreated to her room, missing the smug smirk that flickered across Nathaniel's face the moment her back was turned.

Samuel arrived later with clothes and a laptop, only to be dismissed at the door without stepping inside.

Nathaniel commandeered the living room sofa, typing away on his laptop. Evelyn didn't bother him. After changing, she headed out. "I'm going to the construction site. Don't forget your medicine."

His frown deepened. "You're leaving me here alone?"

"Would you prefer I take you back to Pineview Villa? Or should I call Samuel to babysit you?" she retorted coolly.

Nathaniel fell silent, his expression darkening as she walked away.

Evelyn didn’t understand how things had spiraled like this. I wanted space. Time for him to cool off and finally agree to the divorce. Isabella is waiting for him, after all.

Yet here he was, stubbornly planted in her apartment.

Will he leave once the fever’s gone?

She rubbed her temples, shaking off the thoughts as she drove to the site. Progress was impressive—the office building’s exterior was complete, and interior work was next.

Lost in inspections, she barely noticed the hours slipping by. It was past six-thirty when she finally wrapped up.

Daniel grinned. "Dinner?"

Evelyn checked her phone. "You go ahead. I have things to handle."

"Wouldn’t want to keep you. Mr. Martin might have my head otherwise," he joked.

Since discovering Evelyn was Nathaniel’s wife, Daniel had been extra cautious. Thankfully, she hadn’t held his earlier matchmaking attempts against him.

Evelyn grabbed takeout from Scarlett on her way back.

By the time she arrived, the apartment was dark. Only Nathaniel’s shoes by the entrance confirmed he hadn’t left.

She set the food down and pushed open the bedroom door.

Nathaniel lay sprawled across the bed, his breathing uneven.

Evelyn switched on the lamp, her stomach dropping at the sight of his flushed face.

"Nathaniel?" She touched his forehead—burning.

Not again.
###Chapter 126

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a golden glow over the bedroom. Evelyn stirred awake, her body still humming with the remnants of last night's passion. Nathaniel's arm was draped possessively over her waist, his breathing deep and even.

She carefully slipped out of bed, not wanting to wake him. The marble floor was cool beneath her bare feet as she padded toward the ensuite bathroom. The reflection in the mirror showed flushed cheeks and tousled hair—undeniable evidence of their shared intimacy.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Mrs. Martin?" Alfred's voice was muffled through the door. "Mr. Edward has requested your presence in the study."

Evelyn frowned. Edward rarely summoned her directly. Something must be urgent.

"I'll be right there," she replied, quickly splashing water on her face.

By the time she dressed in a simple ivory blouse and tailored slacks, Nathaniel was awake, leaning against the doorframe with a lazy smirk. "Running off so soon?"

She rolled her eyes but couldn't suppress a smile. "Your grandfather wants to see me."

His smirk faded. "Did he say why?"

"No. But I doubt it's for tea and pleasantries."

Nathaniel pushed off the frame, his expression turning serious. "I'll come with you."

She shook her head. "Let me handle this first. If it's business, you know how he gets."

He hesitated but finally nodded. "Fine. But if he gives you trouble—"

"I can handle Edward," she assured him, pressing a quick kiss to his lips before heading out.

The walk to the study felt longer than usual. The manor was eerily quiet, the only sound the faint ticking of antique clocks lining the hallway. When she reached the heavy oak doors, she took a steadying breath before knocking.

"Come in."

Edward sat behind his massive mahogany desk, his sharp gaze fixed on a stack of documents. Winston stood beside him, ever the loyal shadow.

"You wanted to see me?" Evelyn kept her tone neutral.

Edward finally looked up, his piercing blue eyes assessing her. "Sit."

She obeyed, folding her hands in her lap.

"I've been reviewing the latest reports from the Summit Realty merger," he began, tapping a finger against the desk. "There are... discrepancies."

Her pulse quickened. "What kind of discrepancies?"

"Financial ones." He slid a folder toward her. "Missing funds. Unauthorized transfers."

Evelyn's stomach dropped as she flipped through the pages. The numbers didn't add up—millions unaccounted for.

"This isn't possible," she murmured. "I oversaw every transaction myself."

Edward's expression darkened. "Then explain how this happened."

Before she could respond, the door burst open. Nathaniel strode in, his jaw set. "What's going on?"

Edward's gaze flicked between them. "Your wife has some explaining to do."

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "Accusing her of something?"

"Just stating facts."

Evelyn stood abruptly. "I didn't take that money. But I will find out who did."

A tense silence settled over the room. Then Edward leaned back, steepling his fingers. "You have forty-eight hours."

Nathaniel stepped forward, his voice dangerously low. "Or what?"

Edward met his glare without flinching. "Or the board will demand answers—one way or another."

Evelyn grabbed Nathaniel's arm before he could say more. "We'll handle this."

As they left the study, Nathaniel's grip on her hand was almost painful. "We're not letting him pin this on you."

She exhaled shakily. "First, we need to find out who's behind it."

His jaw clenched. "I have a feeling I already know."

The unspoken name hung between them like a storm cloud.

Isabella.

Evelyn jolted awake to find Nathaniel burning with fever again. She rushed to prepare the antipyretics, her hands trembling slightly as she measured the dose. "We should get you to the hospital," she insisted, pressing the cool medicine cup against his palm.

"Absolutely not." His refusal came out raspy, raw with illness.

"Persistent fever leads to complications. An IV could speed up your recovery." She tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear, avoiding his piercing gaze.

His fingers clenched around the sheets. "Eager to be rid of me, Evelyn?" The accusation hung thick between them. When she finally met his eyes, the glassy sheen in those usually sharp gray irises made her breath catch. Was that... moisture gathering at his lashes?

The observation startled her. While she'd never wanted this forced cohabitation, abandoning him in sickness had never crossed her mind.

Without answering, she straightened his blankets with unnecessary force. "If you won't go to the hospital, at least let Dr. Harrison administer an IV here. Pneumonia isn't something to gamble with."

"Call him then." Nathaniel turned his face toward the window, effectively dismissing her.

Thirty minutes later, Dr. Harrison's familiar knock sounded at the door. The physician took one look at his patient and sighed. "Rest and fluids. Standard protocol."

Evelyn hovered near the footboard. "Will he recover quickly?"

"With proper care." Dr. Harrison fixed Nathaniel with a knowing look. "Eat something substantial or we'll need that IV after all."

Nathaniel's glare could have melted steel. "Do I look fine to you? This is the second spike since midnight."

Evelyn intercepted the tension smoothly. "The fever's making him irritable, Doctor."

"Understandable." Dr. Harrison's lips twitched as he turned to Evelyn. "Fetch some water for his medication, would you?"

The moment Evelyn left, the physician's demeanor shifted. "Your grandfather mentioned pairing Evelyn with Theodore. You know how obedient that boy's always been. One word from me..."

Nathaniel's knuckles whitened against the sheets. "We're still legally married. Unless you want Theodore labeled a homewrecker..."

A chuckle escaped Dr. Harrison. "So you're skipping medication to keep her playing nurse. Clever."

"Delirious ramblings," Nathaniel muttered, but the flush creeping up his neck betrayed him.

"Whatever your game, remember your grandfather's condition. His health won't tolerate much stress." The doctor's warning hung in the air as Evelyn returned with the water.

"Administer these every six hours," Dr. Harrison instructed, handing Evelyn the pill organizer. "I'll take my leave—he's in capable hands."

The apartment plunged into silence after the doctor's departure. Nathaniel sat propped against the headboard, his chiseled features unreadable in the dim light. Evelyn studied the medication instructions to avoid that unsettling gaze.

"Take them," she said finally, offering the pills.

His fingers brushed hers as he accepted the dose. "I need food."

"There's takeout from Scarlett's. Here or the dining room?"

"Here." The single syllable carried exhaustion.

Evelyn nodded and turned toward the kitchen. Behind her, she heard the rustle of sheets and the soft click of pills being set aside—not swallowed. She paused mid-step but didn't turn around. Some battles, she'd learned, weren't hers to fight.
###Chapter 127

The moment Nathaniel stepped into the penthouse, Evelyn knew something was wrong. His usually composed demeanor was replaced by a tense silence, his jaw clenched tight. She set down her sketchbook, watching as he loosened his tie with an impatient tug.

"You're home early," she remarked carefully.

He didn’t answer immediately, his gaze fixed on the cityscape beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows. When he finally spoke, his voice was low, controlled. "We need to talk."

Evelyn’s fingers curled into the fabric of the couch. That phrase never preceded anything good.

Nathaniel turned to face her, his expression unreadable. "Isabella is back."

The name hit her like a physical blow. Isabella Davis—his first love, the woman who had once held his heart before Evelyn ever entered the picture.

Evelyn forced herself to breathe. "Where did you see her?"

"At the charity gala tonight." He ran a hand through his hair, frustration evident. "She approached me. Said she wanted to 'clear the air.'"

Evelyn’s mind raced. Isabella had vanished years ago without a word, leaving Nathaniel to pick up the pieces. Now, she was back—just as Evelyn and Nathaniel had finally found their footing.

"What does she want?" Evelyn asked, though she wasn’t sure she wanted the answer.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "She claims she’s here to apologize. But I don’t trust it."

Evelyn studied him—the tightness in his shoulders, the way his fingers flexed at his sides. He was holding something back.

"There’s more, isn’t there?"

His silence was confirmation enough.

"She’s staying in the city," he admitted. "And she’s working with Summit Realty."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. Summit Realty—Sebastian Wilson’s company, the same man who had been undermining her architectural projects for months.

"This isn’t a coincidence," she murmured.

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened. "No. It’s not."

A knock at the door interrupted them. Alfred, their butler, stepped in with a discreet cough. "Mr. Martin, your grandfather is on the line. He insists it’s urgent."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened further. "Tell him I’ll call him back."

Alfred hesitated. "He said it’s regarding the board meeting tomorrow."

Evelyn could see the war in Nathaniel’s eyes—duty versus the storm brewing between them. She gave him a small nod. "Go. We’ll talk later."

He pressed a kiss to her forehead, his touch lingering just a second too long, as if reassuring himself she was still there. Then he was gone, leaving Evelyn alone with her thoughts—and the unsettling certainty that Isabella’s return was only the beginning.

Downstairs, the elevator doors slid shut behind Nathaniel. Evelyn turned back to the window, the city lights blurring as unshed tears stung her eyes.

Somewhere out there, Isabella was waiting. And Evelyn had a feeling she wasn’t here to apologize.

Nathaniel studied the pills in his palm, his dark eyes narrowing slightly. With deliberate movements, he opened the bedside drawer, wrapped them in a tissue, and tucked them away deep inside.

He was drinking water when Evelyn walked in. "Dr. Harrison said you need to eat to strengthen your immunity," she reminded him, placing a tray of food beside him.

Nathaniel gave a curt nod and finished the meal without protest.

Evelyn had hoped his condition would improve, but by midnight, his fever returned with a vengeance. His skin burned like embers, radiating heat. She pressed medicine into his hand, but he caught her wrist instead, his grip firm.

"Cool me down," he demanded, voice rough.

Evelyn frowned. "Take the medicine first. A fever won’t break just from wiping you down."

"Are you refusing?" His gaze darkened.

She didn’t answer.

Nathaniel’s lips curled into a bitter smile. "Annoyed with me? I heard Grandfather offered to introduce you to Theodore. Are you considering it?"

Evelyn froze.

Her thoughts scattered. Why is he bringing this up now?

Edward’s suggestion had been nothing more than a passing remark—one she’d dismissed immediately. Even if he were serious, he wouldn’t act without her consent.

"Nathaniel," she said evenly, "is this really the time?"

"If you won’t talk, then cool me down."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, fighting back irritation.

Nathaniel’s voice dropped, low and deliberate. "I spent half the night in a cold bath because of this fever. The least you could do is help."

She clenched her jaw. "Take your medicine. It’s late. I’m going to sleep."

She turned away, but Nathaniel flipped her onto her back, pinning her beneath him. His eyes burned into hers. "You’ve grown colder toward me lately. What do you want, Evelyn?"

Her pulse quickened, but her expression remained guarded. She avoided his gaze. "You should be asking yourself that question. What do you want, Nathaniel?"

His grip on her chin tightened. "Is it so hard to care for me? Where’s the woman who used to fuss over me? Was that all an act?"

Evelyn met his eyes, unflinching. "I assumed you’d prefer Isabella’s touch over mine."

Nathaniel’s temper flared. "You always bring her up. Why? Do you enjoy twisting everything back to her?"

His anger was palpable, but Evelyn remained eerily calm.

"It’s not twisting facts," she said quietly. "You wanted a divorce to marry her. Yet here we are. Why?"

Their breaths mingled, faces inches apart.

Before he could respond, she whispered, "Tell me, Nathaniel—are you in love with me? Is that why you won’t let go?"

Silence swallowed the room.

His steady breathing was the only sign time hadn’t frozen.

Evelyn’s heart ached. She already knew the answer.

He’ll never love me.

He didn’t want her linking him to Isabella—not because he cared for her feelings, but to protect Isabella’s reputation.

How deeply he loves her.

Even now, he shielded her perfectly.
###Chapter 128

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, she felt the weight of countless eyes on her. The air was thick with tension, the kind that made her fingers curl instinctively into fists. She had known this confrontation was coming, yet nothing could have prepared her for the storm brewing in Nathaniel’s stormy gaze.

"Evelyn," Nathaniel’s voice was low, controlled, but the undercurrent of anger was unmistakable. "We need to talk."

She swallowed hard, forcing herself to meet his eyes. "I know."

The guests around them continued their conversations, oblivious to the silent battle raging between them. The clinking of champagne glasses and the soft hum of orchestral music only served to heighten the surreal tension.

Isabella, standing a few feet away, smirked into her wineglass. Her presence was like a shadow, always lurking, always waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Evelyn clenched her jaw. She wouldn’t give her the satisfaction.

Nathaniel took her elbow, guiding her toward the balcony with a grip that was firm but not unkind. The cool night air hit her face as they stepped outside, a stark contrast to the stifling atmosphere inside.

"Explain," he demanded, his voice barely above a whisper. "Why did you go behind my back with the Summit Realty deal?"

Evelyn’s heart pounded. She had expected this, yet the accusation still stung. "I didn’t go behind your back," she said, her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands. "I made a judgment call. The terms were better, and I knew you’d agree if you saw the numbers."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "That’s not the point, Evelyn. We’re supposed to be partners. You don’t make decisions like that without consulting me."

She exhaled sharply. "And what about you? How many decisions have you made without telling me?"

The silence that followed was deafening. His expression darkened, and for a moment, she thought he might walk away. Instead, he stepped closer, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "This isn’t about me. This is about trust."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Trust. The word hung between them like a blade.

Before she could respond, the balcony doors swung open, and Gregory appeared, his face pale. "Evelyn, we have a problem. The permits for the waterfront project—they’ve been revoked."

Her stomach dropped. "What? Why?"

Gregory’s gaze flickered to Nathaniel before settling back on her. "Someone filed a complaint. Anonymous tip about zoning violations."

Evelyn didn’t need to look at Nathaniel to know what he was thinking. This was too convenient. Someone was sabotaging them.

And she had a very good idea who.

Her fingers curled into fists again as she turned back to Nathaniel, her voice barely a whisper. "We’ll handle this. Together."

For the first time that night, something flickered in his eyes—something that looked like hope.

But it was gone as quickly as it came.

Because in the distance, Isabella’s laughter rang out, sharp and triumphant.

And Evelyn knew—the real battle had only just begun.

Evelyn stopped pressing for answers—it would only humiliate her further. She met Nathaniel's gaze calmly and murmured, "I need to sleep."

He studied her for a long moment before releasing her chin and turning away, settling back into his side of the bed.

Facing away from him, Evelyn shut her eyes. Though frustration coiled inside her, sleep eluded her—until Caroline’s advice echoed in her mind. "Stay positive. A mother’s mood shapes the baby’s temperament. A happy mother means a cheerful child."

She inhaled deeply, forcing her muscles to relax. Gradually, the tension ebbed, and she drifted into sleep.

Nathaniel lay awake, listening to her steady breathing. His chest tightened with something he couldn’t name. He stole a glance at her silhouette, the curve of her back, and an unfamiliar ache pulsed through him.

The night passed without dreams.

When dawn broke, Evelyn woke to find Nathaniel still asleep. She slipped out of bed quietly, careful not to disturb him.

In the kitchen, she warmed soup and toasted bread. By nine, he still hadn’t stirred. She pressed a hand to his forehead—no fever. Relief flickered, but concern lingered.

She debated waking him but hesitated. Instead, she stayed home, watching over him.

Nathaniel finally rose just before noon.

"Would you prefer soup or pasta?" Evelyn asked, her tone neutral.

They both avoided mentioning last night’s tension.

"Either is fine," he replied, voice rough with sleep.

"I’ll heat the soup."

Light meals were best after illness.

As she moved to the kitchen, Nathaniel sank onto the sofa, rubbing his temples. A dull headache throbbed behind his eyes.

Through the glass door, he watched her move—graceful, efficient. The sight was unfamiliar yet strangely comforting.

Is this what domestic peace looks like?

The doorbell shattered his thoughts.

Nathaniel rose and opened the door.

"Evelyn—" Gregory stood there, arms laden with packages. His smile faltered when he saw Nathaniel.

Nathaniel’s gaze dropped to the items in Gregory’s hands before flicking back to his face. "Mr. Wilson," he said coolly. "This is unexpected."

Gregory recovered swiftly. "Mr. Martin. Aren’t you going to invite me in?"

"Do you think it’s appropriate to visit a married woman’s home unannounced?"

"If you’re so happily married, why did Evelyn move out of Pineview Villa?" Gregory’s smile turned sharp. "What did you do to drive her away?"

The air between them crackled. Neither man looked away.

Nathaniel smirked. "Ah, you’re single. You wouldn’t understand how couples reconcile after arguments. As for why she left—must I explain our private affairs to you? Or should I spell it out? This is just how we play."

Gregory’s jaw clenched.

Nathaniel leaned against the doorframe, voice dropping to a taunt. "But since you’re here, I’ll clarify: Evelyn and I are trying for a baby. She’s going to be a mother soon. So, unless you want to disrupt that, I suggest you keep your distance."

Gregory paled. "What?"

Nathaniel’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. "You heard me. We’re starting a family. Stay out of it."



###Chapter 129

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew over the blueprints, making precise adjustments with her mechanical pencil. The scent of freshly brewed coffee from Gabrielle's desk mingled with the faint aroma of ink and paper.

A sharp knock interrupted her concentration. "Come in," she called without looking up.

The door swung open to reveal Nathaniel, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders. "Working through lunch again?" His deep voice held a note of amusement as he placed a paper bag on her desk. "I brought your favorite—turkey avocado from that deli you love."

Evelyn finally glanced up, her lips curving into a smile. "You're my savior. I completely lost track of time." She reached for the sandwich, her stomach growling in anticipation.

Nathaniel leaned against her desk, watching her unwrap the food. "Edward called an emergency board meeting this afternoon. Something about the Summit Realty merger." His expression darkened slightly. "I have a feeling Isabella's involved."

Evelyn paused mid-bite. "What makes you say that?"

"Call it instinct." He straightened his tie, a telltale sign of his agitation. "Samuel intercepted some emails between her agent Vanessa and Summit's project manager Jonathan. The timing's too convenient."

Setting down her sandwich, Evelyn wiped her hands. "Should I come with you?"

Nathaniel shook his head. "Better if you stay clear. If this is another one of her schemes..." His jaw tightened. "I won't let her sabotage us again."

Before Evelyn could respond, her phone buzzed. A text from Charlotte flashed on screen: Emergency at the clinic. Can you cover my shift tonight?

She typed a quick reply as Nathaniel's phone rang. He answered tersely, his posture stiffening. "When?... No, delay them... I'll be there in twenty." Hanging up, he met Evelyn's concerned gaze. "Isabella just arrived at Martin Tower with Sebastian Wilson. They're demanding immediate renegotiation of the merger terms."

Evelyn stood abruptly, knocking over her coffee cup. The dark liquid spread across her blueprints like a stain. "This isn't coincidence. She's been planning this."

Nathaniel caught her hand, his grip firm. "Trust me to handle this. Go help Charlotte—we'll reconvene tonight." He pressed a kiss to her forehead before striding out, his polished shoes clicking against the hardwood.

Gabrielle appeared in the doorway, wide-eyed. "Everything okay?"

Evelyn stared at the ruined blueprints, then at the closed elevator doors where Nathaniel had disappeared. "No," she murmured. "But it's about to get interesting."

She grabbed her bag and coat, pausing only to toss the stained designs in the trash. As the elevator descended, her phone buzzed again—an unknown number. The message contained a single photo: Isabella and Sebastian laughing over cocktails, dated yesterday. The caption read: Some partnerships are meant to be.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her phone. The game had changed. And this time, she wouldn't play by anyone else's rules.

Nathaniel's brows knitted together. His chiseled features remained impassive, but his eyes betrayed a flicker of disbelief.

Noticing his reaction, Gregory narrowed his gaze and spoke coolly, "Mr. Wilson, we have no need for these items you've brought. Now isn't the best time for visitors. Goodbye."

With that, he moved to shut the door, but Nathaniel instinctively wedged his foot against it and called out, "Evelyn, are you home?"

His voice carried clearly, cutting through the hum of the range hood in the kitchen. Evelyn paused, thinking she had imagined it—until she heard it again.

She stepped out to find Nathaniel blocking the door while Gregory attempted to close it. "What's going on?" she asked.

Gregory froze. Seizing the moment, Nathaniel pushed the door open wider.

"Evelyn," he murmured, "I heard you moved out. I was worried, so I picked up some of your favorite ingredients. Thought I'd cook for you."

Evelyn reached for the bags in his hands. "You didn’t have to. I already have everything I need."

"Doesn’t matter. Whether I bring them or not is up to me." He adjusted his grip. "It’s heavy. Let me carry it. Where’s the kitchen?"

She gestured, and Nathaniel strode past her, heading straight for the kitchen.

Gregory remained by the door, fingers tight around the knob, his displeasure palpable. "Evelyn, you're letting him walk right in—right in front of me."

"Gregory is my friend," she replied evenly. "You know that. I don’t turn friends away when they visit."

The air between them grew colder. Gregory said nothing, but the tension coiled around him like a storm.

Silence stretched uncomfortably.

"Evelyn, do you have a soup pot?" Nathaniel's voice floated from the kitchen.

She glanced at Gregory before hurrying after Nathaniel.

Watching her go, seeing her stand beside Nathaniel in the kitchen, something sharp twisted in Gregory’s chest. His usually composed face was pale from fever, his eyes bloodshot from restless nights.

The sight of Nathaniel’s easy smile and Evelyn’s responding laughter grated on him. Before he could stop himself, he slammed the front door shut and stalked into the kitchen.

Without a word, he seized Evelyn’s wrist and pulled her toward the bedroom.

She resisted instinctively, but his grip was unyielding. Only when the bedroom door closed behind them did he release her—only to press her against it, his expression unreadable. "Send him away. I don’t want him here."

His breath was hot against her ear, his voice low, almost pleading. His fingers tightened at her waist, preventing any escape.

Evelyn lifted her chin, meeting his gaze from mere inches away. "That’s incredibly rude."

"So you’d rather provoke me than be polite?"

She frowned, confused. "Gregory came as a friend to cook for me. You’re here too—what’s the problem?"

"Would you have let him in if I wasn’t?"

"If you weren’t here, I’d be at work by now."

"You’re impossible." His grip tightened. "Don’t forget, Evelyn—you’re still married."

His gaze burned into her, his fingers pressing just shy of painful. For a heartbeat, she wondered if he might actually crush her.

###Chapter 130

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn’s office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort in the Maldives. The design was ambitious, but she thrived on challenges.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Ms. Mitchell, Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn nodded. "Send him in."

Gregory strode in, his usual confident demeanor slightly frayed at the edges. "We have a problem," he said without preamble.

She arched a brow. "What kind of problem?"

"The investors are getting cold feet. They’re worried about the timeline."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "We’ve accounted for every possible delay. What’s really bothering them?"

Gregory hesitated. "Rumors. Someone’s been whispering that Martin Group is overextending itself."

Her grip tightened on the pen in her hand. Nathaniel’s company. Of course.

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel: We need to talk. Tonight. 8 PM. The penthouse.

Her pulse quickened. That tone—it wasn’t a request. It was a summons.

Gregory studied her face. "Everything alright?"

She forced a smile. "Just a minor hiccup. I’ll handle the investors. You focus on the site inspections."

Once alone, Evelyn leaned back in her chair, staring at the ceiling. The weight of unspoken tensions pressed down on her. Whatever Nathaniel wanted, it wasn’t good.

And then there was Isabella.

The woman had been a ghost from the past, haunting the edges of their lives. Evelyn had seen the way Nathaniel’s expression darkened at the mention of her name.

She checked the time. Six hours until she’d face whatever storm was coming.

Six hours to prepare.

Outside, the city hummed with life, oblivious to the tempest brewing behind closed doors.

Evelyn remained silent. Nathaniel gripped her chin, his eyes narrowing dangerously. "Evelyn," he demanded, voice low and rough with barely restrained anger. "Answer me. Will you send him away?"

"Even if he were just an acquaintance, I wouldn't turn him out," Evelyn replied coolly. "But Gregory isn’t just anyone. He’s my business partner—someone who’s stood by me when I needed support the most."

"So you refuse to draw the line." His grip tightened, fingers pressing into her skin. The air between them crackled with tension as he leaned in, his breath hot against her lips.

Evelyn met his gaze without flinching. "What exactly do you mean by 'distance'? Should I cut off every man in my life, even if it’s strictly professional? Should I quit my job and lock myself away?"

"I’m not asking you to isolate yourself," Nathaniel bit out. "Just stay away from men who clearly want more than friendship. Don’t pretend you don’t see how Gregory looks at you. Or maybe you do—and you like the attention."

"Nathaniel Martin!" Evelyn snapped, jerking back. His name left her lips like a blade. "Is that really what you think of me?"

For a heartbeat, he hesitated, his dark eyes tracing the defiant curve of her mouth. Then, as if the sight of her speaking irritated him, he closed the distance between them, capturing her lips in a searing kiss.

Evelyn’s back hit the door behind her, leaving no escape. Instinctively, she lifted a hand to shield her mouth—but Nathaniel’s lips only grazed her palm instead.

He didn’t pull away. His gaze darkened, simmering with something unreadable as their eyes locked.

"Listen to me," Evelyn said, her voice steady despite the storm in her chest. "You can doubt me all you want, but don’t you dare insult Gregory. He’s been nothing but a friend to me—and that won’t change."

With that, she shoved against Nathaniel’s chest. This time, he let her go.

Evelyn didn’t look back as she strode out of the room.

In the kitchen, Gregory was stirring a pot of clam chowder, the rich aroma filling the air. Beside it, a tray of roasted chicken and a crisp lettuce salad waited.

Evelyn handed him a bottle of water. "Thanks for this."

Gregory chuckled, twisting off the cap. "Since when do you thank me for basic decency?" He took a long sip before setting the bottle down.

His gaze flickered to her, noting the way she stared blankly at the simmering soup. After a beat, he asked, "Why did you leave?"

He wanted to ask if Nathaniel’s reckless games had driven her out, but the words stuck in his throat.

Evelyn blinked, refocusing. "I needed space. Things have been... overwhelming."

"Space is good," Gregory murmured. Then, carefully, "He followed you here, didn’t he?"

She let out a quiet, humorless laugh. "Of course not."

Gregory’s expression turned serious. "Evelyn, he told me something earlier. Said you two were planning for a baby. Is that true?"

Her head snapped up, eyes wide. "He’s talking nonsense."

A shadow crossed Gregory’s face, though his voice remained gentle. "Then what are your plans? He wanted a divorce before. Now, it seems like he’s changed his mind."

Evelyn exhaled slowly, fingers tightening around the counter’s edge.

She had no answer.



###Chapter 131

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of our penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. I stretched lazily in bed, savoring the rare moment of tranquility before Nathaniel's arms tightened around my waist, pulling me closer.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he murmured against my hair, his voice still thick with sleep.

I turned to face him, tracing the strong line of his jaw with my fingertips. "Someone's in a good mood today."

His lips curved into that devastating smile that still made my pulse race. "How could I not be? I woke up next to the most beautiful woman in the world."

Before I could respond, his phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. Nathaniel groaned, reaching for it with one hand while the other kept me anchored against him.

"It's Samuel," he said, scanning the message. "Emergency board meeting at ten. Father's called an urgent vote on the Singapore acquisition."

I sat up immediately, the cozy atmosphere shattered. "That's two weeks early! They can't just—"

"Apparently they can." Nathaniel's expression darkened as he threw back the covers. "Grandfather must have gotten wind of our plans to block it."

As we dressed in hurried silence, my mind raced through contingency plans. The Martin Group's proposed acquisition would displace hundreds of low-income families—exactly the kind of heartless corporate maneuver Nathaniel had been working to change since taking over as CEO.

In the elevator downstairs, Nathaniel straightened his tie with sharp, angry motions. "I should have seen this coming. Isabella's been cozying up to the board members all week."

The mention of his ex's name sent an unpleasant jolt through me. "You think she's behind this?"

"Who else?" His jaw clenched. "She's been waiting for an opportunity to undermine me ever since I rejected her... proposition."

The elevator doors opened to reveal Alfred waiting with our coats. "Your car is ready, sir. Madam." The butler's usually impassive face showed rare concern. "Mr. Edward has arrived early as well. He's waiting in the conference room with... other parties."

Nathaniel's hand found mine, squeezing tightly as we stepped into the crisp autumn air. "Whatever happens today," he said quietly, "remember we're in this together."

The sleek black town car pulled away from the curb, carrying us toward what I knew would be the most pivotal battle of Nathaniel's career. Through the tinted windows, the Martin Group headquarters loomed ahead like a modern-day fortress—one we might not leave victorious.

My phone vibrated with an incoming text from Gregory: "Plans leaked. Media knows about the evictions. Damage control needed ASAP."

I showed Nathaniel the message, watching as his expression turned to stone. "Perfect timing," he said bitterly. "Just as we're about to walk into the lion's den."

As we pulled up to the building, a crowd of reporters already clustered at the entrance, cameras flashing. Nathaniel took a deep breath, his CEO mask sliding into place. "Showtime."

The car door opened, and we stepped out into the storm.

Evelyn's face remained impassive, her voice quiet as she murmured, "Some things can't be taken back once they're done."

"Are you planning to leave too?"

"Yeah, the thought has crossed my mind."

She didn’t deny it, but she didn’t elaborate either.

There were things she could confide in Isaac without hesitation, but with Gregory, it was different. His feelings for her went beyond friendship, and since she couldn’t return them, she kept her distance.

By noon, Gregory had finished cooking.

He declined to stay for lunch. "If I linger, it’ll only upset Mr. Martin and strain things between you two. I don’t want to make things harder for you."

Evelyn frowned. "It’s fine. He’s just being petty because of me."

Gregory merely nodded. "I have an appointment nearby anyway. Now’s as good a time as any to leave."

Despite her attempts to persuade him, Gregory insisted on going without eating, so Evelyn didn’t press further.

As she walked him to the door, she said, "Gregory, don’t bother bringing groceries next time. I can handle the cooking. You’re already swamped with work at the firm."

Gregory was slightly taken aback by her gentle refusal.

He nodded. "Understood. Eat while it’s hot. You’ve lost weight lately."

Evelyn watched as Gregory stepped into the elevator, then closed the door.

After a glance at the food on the table, she exhaled softly before heading to the kitchen to reheat the soup she’d prepared earlier.

Once done, she knocked on the bedroom door.

"Nathaniel, lunch is ready."

"Go ahead and eat with Gregory. Don’t mind me. Even if I’m still feverish and haven’t had breakfast, it’s fine. If I come out, I’ll just ruin your meal with him—might even chase him away. Why bother calling me at all?"

His icy tone made Evelyn smirk. He sounded exactly like a scheming drama queen, expertly playing the victim.

She quipped, "Then I won’t call you anymore. I’ll just eat alone."

"Why eat alone when Gregory’s gone out of his way to cook for you?"

"He’s already left. Can’t I enjoy a meal by myself?"

Evelyn chuckled and turned back to the dining table without another word.

Just as she picked up her spoon, Nathaniel strode into the room.

She glanced up calmly. "What would you like?"

His eyes swept indifferently over the spread. "I don’t eat food prepared by uninvited guests."

She had expected this, so she’d reheated the soup for him and prepared some sides.

But Nathaniel made no move to eat. Instead, he muttered, "I have a headache."

Evelyn blinked. "Did you take anything for it? Why the sudden headache? Is your fever back?"

As she spoke, she reached out to press a hand to his forehead. Hmm… No fever.

"Because you’ve been driving me crazy."

Then, with an accusatory edge, he added, "All morning."

Evelyn sighed in exasperation. "Nathaniel, you’re being ridiculous."

She turned to return to her seat, but before she could, Nathaniel pulled her into his arms, seating her on his lap.

Instinctively, she looped her arms around his neck, raising a brow. "What’s gotten into you?"

"I’m being ridiculous?"

One hand rested on her waist, the other tilting her chin up. Nathaniel’s expression was as composed as ever, but his voice held something darker.

###Chapter 132

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. Evelyn stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

She sighed, rolling onto her back. The bed still smelled like him, that intoxicating mix of sandalwood and something uniquely Nathaniel. It had been weeks since they’d had a proper conversation, let alone a morning together. The Martin Group was consuming him whole.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory:

"Meeting at 10. Client wants revisions on the waterfront project. Bring your A-game."

Evelyn groaned. The waterfront project was supposed to be her breakthrough, but the client—Summit Realty—was proving impossible to please. Every design she submitted was met with nitpicking from Jonathan Blake, their project manager.

She dragged herself out of bed, padding barefoot to the ensuite. The reflection in the mirror stared back at her—tired eyes, messy hair. When had she last slept properly?

The shower did little to wake her up. As she toweled off, her phone buzzed again. This time, it was Gabrielle.

"Emergency. Isabella Davis just walked into the office. She’s asking for you."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. Isabella. Nathaniel’s ex. The woman who had haunted their relationship from the start.

She dressed in record time, throwing on a sleek black pantsuit and twisting her damp hair into a hasty bun. The elevator ride down to the lobby felt endless, her mind racing with possibilities. What could Isabella possibly want?

The moment she stepped into the office, all eyes turned to her. Gabrielle rushed over, whispering, "She’s in Conference Room B. Looks like she means business."

Evelyn squared her shoulders and pushed the door open.

Isabella sat at the head of the table, legs crossed, sipping a latte as if she owned the place. She looked flawless, as always—blonde hair cascading over one shoulder, lips painted a dangerous shade of red.

"Evelyn," she purred. "So nice of you to finally join me."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Isabella. To what do I owe the pleasure?"

Isabella set down her cup, her gaze sharpening. "I hear you’re working with Summit Realty. Funny, I just signed on as their new brand ambassador."

The air left Evelyn’s lungs.

Isabella smirked. "Oh, didn’t Nathaniel tell you? We’ll be seeing a lot more of each other."

The door creaked open behind them.

"Actually," came Nathaniel’s voice, deep and unreadable, "that’s what I came to discuss."

Evelyn turned. He stood there, his expression unreadable, his presence filling the room.

Isabella’s smile widened. "Perfect timing, darling."

Evelyn’s fingers curled into fists.

This was far from over.

Evelyn's sharp gaze briefly locked with Nathaniel's before she deliberately looked away. Her voice was cool, almost detached. "And you think you're not?"

"So, who isn't childish then? Gregory?"

"Why do you keep bringing him into this? Weren’t you the one who insisted this was just between us?"

"He inserted himself into our business. I didn’t invite him."

"But you can’t seem to have a conversation without his name slipping out, can you?" Her tone remained icy.

Nathaniel’s obsession with keeping Isabella out of their arguments made his fixation on Gregory all the more baffling.

His fingers brushed lightly under her chin, tilting her face toward his. His voice was low, devoid of emotion. "So, are you going to stay away from him? I don’t like seeing you two close, and I won’t tolerate him sniffing around with ulterior motives. He’s not sincere. People like that should be avoided."

Evelyn frowned, ready to argue his absurd logic—but before she could speak, Nathaniel closed the distance between them, his lips capturing hers in a searing kiss.

A soft gasp escaped her, muffled against his mouth.

His kiss burned with possessive intensity, as if he wanted to claim every inch of her. She stiffened, fingers curling into his shirt, torn between pushing him away and surrendering.

But resistance only seemed to stoke his hunger.

Slowly, her strength waned, and she melted into the heat of his embrace.

They were still locked together when the doorbell shattered the moment.

Nathaniel didn’t pull away immediately. Instead, he lingered, his forehead pressed to hers, his voice rough with desire. "I want to see you break."

Evelyn’s breath hitched, her pulse erratic. "Let me go. Someone’s at the door."

"They can wait." His voice dropped to a dark whisper, heavy with unspoken promises.

Heat flooded her cheeks as understanding dawned. The air between them crackled with tension.

The doorbell chimed again, insistent.

This time, Evelyn pushed against his chest, and Nathaniel reluctantly loosened his grip. She slipped from his arms, smoothing her clothes as she moved toward the door.

When she opened it, Samuel stood on the threshold, holding an elegant thermal carrier.

"Mrs. Martin," he greeted politely. "I’ve brought dinner."

"Dinner?" She blinked, suddenly remembering the untouched meal still on the table. A flush crept up her neck at the realization of how much time had passed since they’d last eaten.

Samuel, oblivious to her thoughts, continued smoothly. "Mr. Martin ordered from The Scarlet. May I come in?"

Though his tone was professional, the slight hesitation in his voice suggested he’d been waiting longer than expected.

Evelyn stepped aside just as Nathaniel’s voice cut through the room. "Let him in."

Samuel entered, approaching Nathaniel with quiet efficiency. "Shall I set everything up now, sir?"

A faint nod was his only reply.

As Samuel began arranging the new dishes, his gaze flickered to the untouched food still on the table. "What should I do with these, Mr. Martin?"

"Dispose of them. Do whatever you want with them." Nathaniel’s tone was indifferent.

Samuel nodded and reached to clear the plates—but Evelyn stopped him. "Wait."

He paused, glancing at Nathaniel for direction.

Evelyn kept her eyes locked on Nathaniel, her voice firm. "What are you doing?"
###Chapter 133

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

She sighed, sitting up and running a hand through her tousled hair. The silence of the villa was deafening. Even Alfred, their ever-attentive butler, moved about quietly, as if afraid to disturb the fragile peace.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory.

"Evelyn, we need to finalize the blueprints for the Summit project by noon. Edward’s team is pushing for revisions."

She groaned. Another day of endless meetings and last-minute changes.

As she dressed, her mind wandered to Nathaniel. Lately, he’d been distant—buried in work, coming home late, barely speaking. Was it stress? Or was it… her?

Isabella Davis.

The name alone sent a chill down her spine. The woman who had once held Nathaniel’s heart. The woman who had suddenly reappeared in their lives.

Evelyn clenched her fists. No. She wouldn’t let doubt consume her.

Downstairs, the scent of freshly brewed coffee greeted her. Alfred stood by the dining table, arranging breakfast with his usual precision.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he said softly.

"Morning, Alfred." She forced a smile.

"Mr. Martin left early. He mentioned an urgent meeting with Mr. Sinclair."

Her stomach twisted. Donovan Sinclair—Edward’s shady associate. What business did Nathaniel have with him?

Before she could dwell on it, her phone rang again. This time, it was Charlotte.

"Evie, you need to see this."

A link followed. Evelyn tapped it, and her blood ran cold.

A gossip column. A photo of Nathaniel and Isabella, standing too close outside a high-end restaurant. The headline screamed:

"Reunion of the Decade? Martin Heir Spotted with Ex-Lover!"

Her hands trembled.

This wasn’t just stress. This was something else entirely.

And she was going to find out what.

"I'm simply exchanging a few plates," Nathaniel remarked with deliberate nonchalance.

Evelyn's brows knitted together. "Nathaniel, don't you think this is going too far? If you don’t want to eat them, stick to the soup. But can’t you at least acknowledge someone else’s effort?"

"I never invited him to cook for me. He showed up unannounced. Allowing him inside was already my concession to you. Did you really expect me to let you eat his food?"

"But I already did."

"Then consider it done."

Nathaniel’s tone was final. He shot Samuel a sharp glance, silently commanding him to act swiftly.

Samuel hesitated, stealing a nervous look at Evelyn before hastily replacing the dishes and retreating.

The room plunged into silence—tense and suffocating, but only for Evelyn. Nathaniel remained composed, his expression unreadable as he studied her. "Eat before it gets cold."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes, her voice icy. "I’ve lost my appetite. Enjoy your meal alone."

With that, she turned on her heel and marched back to the bedroom, slamming the door shut and locking it behind her.

Never had she witnessed Nathaniel act so irrationally—let alone resort to such petty theatrics as swapping dishes.

Forget the absurdity of sending Samuel, a top-tier executive, on a food delivery errand. The mere idea was juvenile.

Evelyn was seething. Those dishes had taken over an hour to prepare, only to be discarded without a second thought.

It felt like a blatant disregard for her.

Then, her hand instinctively drifted to her abdomen. She forced herself to take slow, deep breaths, reigning in her temper.

Baby, did you see that? That’s your father—acting like a spoiled child.

She stayed in the bedroom, refusing to emerge.

Nathaniel, still recovering from his fever, barely touched his food. He sipped some soup and picked at the vegetables before pushing his plate away.

His gaze flicked to the closed bedroom door. His handsome face betrayed nothing, but a cold glint flickered in his eyes.

Did she really enjoy Gregory’s cooking that much?

He settled in the living room, working on his laptop.

After checking the time, he rose and approached the bedroom door, rapping his knuckles lightly against the wood. "Evelyn, open the door."

Silence.

He tried again, this time with an edge. "Evelyn, if you don’t open this door, I’ll break it down."

Still, no response.

His jaw tightened. "Evelyn, I haven’t taken my medication. Open the door so I can get it."

Another knock. Then, abruptly, the door swung open.

Evelyn stepped out, her expression blank. She avoided his gaze, moving past him toward the living room.

Nathaniel’s patience snapped. He seized her wrist, his grip firm as he glared down at her. "Are you throwing a tantrum because I wouldn’t let you eat Gregory’s food?"

Evelyn met his gaze, her voice eerily calm. "I never said that. But if that’s what you’ve decided, then fine. Your thoughts are your own—I can’t control them."

A humorless chuckle escaped him.

His dark eyes held no warmth, only biting mockery. "So now you’re implying you’re upset because of him? What’s next? Divorce me and run off with him?"

Evelyn stared at him, incredulous. "Nathaniel, do you even hear yourself? We’ve been married for a year. I’ve never been unfaithful. But since you don’t love me, why does it matter who I’m friends with? Why bother pretending to care?"

Nathaniel’s expression remained stoic, but a storm brewed in his gaze. "So you refuse to distance yourself from him? You won’t set boundaries?"

###Chapter 134

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Pineview Villa, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. Evelyn stood by the window, her fingers tracing the delicate rim of her coffee cup. The warmth of the porcelain seeped into her skin, but it did little to ease the tension coiling in her chest.

Nathaniel had left before dawn—again.

She exhaled sharply, setting the cup down with a quiet clink. The silence of the villa was suffocating. Even Alfred, their ever-attentive butler, seemed to tread more lightly these days.

Her phone buzzed on the counter. A message from Gregory flashed on the screen:

"Meeting with Summit Realty at 10. Sebastian is pushing for revisions. We need you here."

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. Summit Realty had been a thorn in her side since the project began. Sebastian Wilson, their smug CEO, had a habit of making last-minute demands just to assert dominance.

She typed a quick reply. "On my way."

As she grabbed her blazer, the front door creaked open. Nathaniel stepped inside, his tailored suit immaculate, his expression unreadable.

"You're back," she said, forcing neutrality into her tone.

His gaze flickered to her. "Briefly. I have another meeting in an hour."

Of course he did.

Evelyn bit back the retort on her tongue. Instead, she adjusted her bag strap. "I’m heading to the office. Summit’s being difficult."

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed. "Do you need me to step in?"

The offer surprised her. Lately, he’d been so absorbed in Martin Group affairs that she’d stopped expecting his involvement in her work.

"No," she said after a beat. "I can handle Sebastian."

A ghost of a smirk touched Nathaniel’s lips. "I don’t doubt that."

For a fleeting moment, the tension between them eased. Then his phone rang, shattering the fragile peace. He glanced at the screen, his expression hardening.

"I have to take this."

Evelyn nodded, already turning away. "See you tonight."

She didn’t wait for his response.

Outside, the crisp autumn air did little to clear her mind. As her driver pulled up, she slid into the backseat, her thoughts churning.

Something was off with Nathaniel.

And she intended to find out what.

Across town, Isabella Davis adjusted the silk scarf around her neck, her reflection in the boutique mirror flawless. Behind her, Vanessa tapped her foot impatiently.

"You’re stalling," Vanessa accused.

Isabella smirked. "I’m savoring the moment."

The moment before everything changed.

She pulled out her phone, scrolling to a recent photo—Evelyn and Nathaniel at a charity gala, their smiles polished for the cameras.

A slow, calculated smile curved her lips.

"Let’s give them something real to smile about."

Vanessa’s eyes gleamed. "The press release is ready."

Isabella pocketed her phone. "Perfect."

The game was just beginning.

And Evelyn had no idea what was coming.

Evelyn's silence was interpreted as agreement.

The air between them grew icier, and Nathaniel's voice dropped to a dangerous timbre. "Evelyn, mark my words. If he dares to seek you out again, and you meet him alone, I will ensure he never steps foot in Mayby again."

With that, he turned on his heel and strode back to the bedroom, leaving Evelyn rooted in place, stunned.

Frustration coiled in her chest. Why does he get to dictate my life while flaunting his closeness with Isabella?

First Gregory, then Isaac.

Each time, Nathaniel had been relentless—forbidding her from interacting with them, demanding she keep her distance.

Did marriage mean surrendering all friendships with the opposite sex?

Evelyn exhaled sharply, sinking into the couch as her gaze drifted to the window, lost in thought.

Then, her phone buzzed on the coffee table.

An unknown number flashed on the screen.

She hesitated before answering. "Hello?"

"Evelyn, what game are you playing?" Isabella's shrill voice pierced through the line.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the phone. Had she known it was Isabella, she would’ve ignored it.

"What do you want?" she replied coolly.

"Did you hide Nathaniel from me? Do you honestly think keeping him from contacting me will make him love you? You're delusional!"

"Are you drunk?"

Evelyn's tone turned glacial, her eyes flashing with defiance.

Isabella's voice trembled with fury. "You moved out of Pineview Villa, didn’t you? So why are you still clinging to him? Playing hard to get? Do you really think Nathaniel will fall for that? He doesn’t love you—never has. He’s going to marry me."

"Mind your own business," Evelyn snapped. "And remember your place."

She couldn’t believe Isabella had the audacity to confront her when she was the one entangled in an inappropriate relationship with Nathaniel.

Without another word, Evelyn ended the call.

On the other end, Isabella nearly shattered her phone, her eyes darkening with venom. "Evelyn, you’ll regret this."

Lately, Isabella had been spiraling. Isaac had refused to compose a song for her, and with her new single’s release looming, she couldn’t secure a reputable lyricist—leaving her the laughingstock of the industry.

She blamed Evelyn for everything.

Her hatred festered.

But Evelyn remained oblivious—and indifferent.

She wasn’t surprised Isabella knew she’d moved out. But the accusation of playing hard to get? That stung in a way she couldn’t articulate.

Did Nathaniel see it that way too?

Her lips pressed into a thin line, her thoughts a tempest.

Dinner arrived courtesy of Samuel.

Before she could cook, he’d already brought the meal.

They ate in suffocating silence.

Afterward, Nathaniel returned to work. He seems fine now. Does that mean he’ll leave soon?

She didn’t ask. She wasn’t in the mood for another argument.

Later, after some solitude, Evelyn changed into workout gear and grabbed her phone, heading for the door.

She hadn’t told Nathaniel.

But just as her fingers brushed the doorknob, a hand slammed it shut.

Nathaniel’s brows furrowed, his voice icy. "Where do you think you’re going? Running away because you didn’t like what I said?"
###Chapter 135

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She tapped her pencil absently against the blueprint spread before her, her mind elsewhere. The soft hum of the city outside barely registered as she replayed last night's conversation with Nathaniel for what felt like the hundredth time.

"We need to talk," he had said, his voice unreadable.

Those four words had haunted her ever since.

A sharp knock at the door snapped her back to the present. Gabrielle, her assistant, poked her head in, her expression hesitant. "Evelyn, Mr. Wilson is here to see you. He says it's urgent."

Evelyn straightened, smoothing a hand over her blouse. "Send him in."

Gregory strode in moments later, his usual composed demeanor frayed at the edges. He dropped a thick folder onto her desk with a thud. "We have a problem."

She flipped it open, scanning the contents quickly. Her stomach twisted. "This can't be right. The zoning permits were approved weeks ago."

"Not anymore," Gregory said grimly. "Someone filed a last-minute appeal, and the board is reconsidering. If this falls through, the entire project is delayed—indefinitely."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the edge of the folder. "Who would do this?"

Gregory hesitated, then sighed. "I did some digging. The appeal was filed under Summit Realty."

Her breath hitched. Sebastian Wilson.

The name alone sent a chill down her spine. The man had been a thorn in her side for years, ever since their disastrous business partnership collapsed. Now, it seemed, he was making his move.

She stood abruptly, grabbing her coat. "I need to see Nathaniel."

Gregory frowned. "Is this really the time? You two have enough on your plates as it is."

She shot him a sharp look. "This is the time. If Sebastian is targeting us, Nathaniel needs to know."

Without waiting for a response, she swept out of the office, her heels clicking decisively against the polished floor.

Outside, the city buzzed with its usual relentless energy, but Evelyn barely noticed. Her thoughts raced ahead, piecing together possibilities, contingencies.

One thing was certain—Sebastian wouldn't win. Not this time.

But as she hailed a cab, a darker thought crept in.

What if this wasn't just about business?

What if it was personal?

And worse—what if Nathaniel already knew?

Evelyn arched a delicate brow, her voice light. "You're reading too much into this. I just need some air. Two days indoors with nothing to do is suffocating."

She didn’t mention the real reason—the baby needed the fresh breeze far more than she did.

But she kept that thought from Nathaniel.

His sharp gaze lingered on her face, assessing. Then, without hesitation, he said, "Then let’s go."

Evelyn turned away, pushing the door open.

To her surprise, Nathaniel followed, closing the door behind them before she could protest.

She blinked at him. "You’re coming?"

His deep voice was calm. "Isn’t that obvious?"

She pressed her lips together, swallowing the rest of her words.

The elevator descended in silence. Outside, the evening air carried a crisp chill, the kind that sharpened the senses rather than numbed them.

They walked side by side, the quiet between them comfortable yet charged.

As twilight painted the sky, they passed a brightly lit supermarket. Evelyn glanced at Nathaniel. "I need to pick something up. You can wait here if—"

"I’ll come," he interrupted smoothly, already striding ahead.

She hurried after him, catching up just as they stepped inside.

The supermarket buzzed with activity. Nathaniel’s expression tightened briefly at the crowd before smoothing back into indifference.

Evelyn grabbed a cart, her voice soft. "Just grabbing milk for tomorrow."

He nodded, falling into step beside her.

Despite his aloof demeanor—tall, striking, his presence like a blade cutting through the mundane—he drew eyes effortlessly. A group of girls nearby giggled, their whispers carrying.

"Look at him! So gorgeous. Cold, but that just makes him hotter. Do you think he’s single?"

"Go ask him! What’s the worst that could happen?"

Nathaniel’s jaw tensed.

Evelyn, oblivious, compared two cartons of milk, her ponytail swaying, loose strands framing her face. Even in simple clothes, she outshone every overly made-up girl in the store.

Before she could react, Nathaniel closed the distance behind her. His arm slid around her waist, his fingers brushing hers as he took the milk from her grasp.

"Get both if you like them," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear.

The cartons landed in the cart with a soft thud.

The girls gasped, cheeks flaming. "Oh my God, he’s taken! Let’s go!"

They scurried away, disappearing into the aisles.

Evelyn caught the exchange but said nothing. Instead, she retrieved one carton and returned it to the shelf.

"Just because something looks good doesn’t mean you need it," she remarked, her tone casual.

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened. "That’s all you have to say?"

She turned toward the exit, but his hand shot out, holding the door shut.

His voice was low, insistent. "No reaction at all? You didn’t notice what just happened?"



###Chapter 136

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples as she reviewed the final blueprints for the Martin Group's latest project. The weight of responsibility pressed on her shoulders—this was her first major assignment since returning to work after the accident.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, straightening her posture.

The door opened to reveal Gabrielle, her assistant, holding a steaming cup of coffee. "Thought you might need this," Gabrielle said with a knowing smile.

Evelyn accepted it gratefully, inhaling the rich aroma. "You're a lifesaver."

Gabrielle hesitated, then added, "Mr. Martin called earlier. He wanted to confirm your lunch plans."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the cup. Nathaniel had been unusually attentive since she'd returned to work, scheduling meetings, checking in—almost as if he were afraid she'd disappear again. She wasn't sure whether to be touched or annoyed.

"Tell him I haven't forgotten," she said lightly.

Gabrielle nodded and turned to leave, but paused. "Oh, and Gregory wanted me to remind you about the client meeting this afternoon. The investors from Summit Realty will be here at three."

Evelyn sighed. Right. Sebastian Wilson and his team. She'd almost forgotten.

"Thanks for the reminder," she said, forcing a smile.

Once alone, Evelyn exhaled slowly, her gaze drifting to the framed photo on her desk—a candid shot of her and Nathaniel at their engagement party, his arm slung casually around her shoulders, both of them laughing.

A sharp pang of longing twisted in her chest.

She missed them—the easy camaraderie, the unspoken understanding. Now, every conversation felt like navigating a minefield, both of them tiptoeing around the unspoken tension.

Her phone buzzed, snapping her back to reality. A text from Nathaniel:

"Looking forward to lunch. Don’t work too hard."

Simple. Casual. But she could read the underlying concern.

Evelyn typed a quick reply, then set her phone aside. She had a mountain of work to get through before the meeting.

But as she turned back to her blueprints, her mind kept wandering—to Nathaniel, to the accident, to the secrets still lingering between them.

And the unsettling feeling that, no matter how hard they tried, things might never be the same again.

"What's going on? Is this about those girls who were eyeing him?" Evelyn mused silently.

She remained composed, her expression unreadable.

Her response was just as measured. "So what if I noticed? What exactly am I supposed to do? I can't dictate people's thoughts. Admiring someone is natural, isn't it?"

Her words only stoked Nathaniel's irritation, his temper simmering dangerously close to the surface.

His face darkened, voice turning icy. "So as my wife, you don’t react when women ask for my number and gossip about you right in front of you?"

Evelyn let out a soft laugh.

She countered, "Nathaniel, what do you expect me to do? Confront them? Warn them to stay away?"

She felt exasperated. Those women didn’t even know he was married. They were simply drawn to his looks, but once they learned the truth, they backed off.

She couldn’t fathom why Nathaniel was suddenly so bothered. After all, Isabella had been openly interested in him for a while, yet he’d never encouraged Evelyn to intervene.

Nathaniel’s displeasure was evident, but his hand remained firmly on Evelyn’s waist.

The closeness made her tense.

This was their first trip to the supermarket together since their marriage. Ironically, despite their impending divorce, they were now doing things they’d never done during their entire first year as husband and wife.

Looking back, ever since he’d brought up divorce, they’d actually been spending more time together—interacting more than ever before.

Evelyn found it bitterly amusing.

She wondered what Nathaniel was playing at.

He was the one who wanted the divorce, yet now he seemed reluctant to follow through.

"Could it be because he hasn’t fulfilled his promise to Isabella about having a child?" The thought twisted painfully in her chest.

But she kept her emotions in check, continuing to browse the fruit section with him, selecting some vitamin-rich options before heading to the checkout.

A moment later, the cashier smiled at Nathaniel. "That’ll be $299, sir."

Nathaniel frowned, glancing at Evelyn.

She swiftly pulled out her phone. "I’ll handle it."

"Ah, I see who’s in charge of the finances at home," the cashier chuckled, impressed by the striking couple. Good looks were one thing, but seeing such a handsome man defer to his wife made her think, Beautiful women truly hold all the power.

After the payment went through, the cashier handed them their bags. "These are heavy. I assume the gentleman wouldn’t want his lady carrying them?"

Nathaniel said nothing, and Evelyn didn’t expect him to help. His hands were usually occupied signing billion-dollar contracts in his office, not grocery bags.

Just as she reached for them, a strong hand snatched the bags first.

Evelyn blinked, then followed him out of the store.

Behind them, the cashier and her coworkers sighed wistfully. "Who wouldn’t want a man like that?"

By the time they returned to the apartment, it was nearly nine.

Nathaniel checked his watch, his expression darkening. "Have you been taking walks this late every night since you moved out?"
###Chapter 137

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples as she studied the blueprints for the new Martin Group project. The weight of the deadline pressed heavily on her shoulders, but she refused to let it show.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Come in," she called, straightening her posture.

Gabrielle, her assistant, stepped inside with a tablet in hand. "Evelyn, Mr. Wilson is here to see you. He says it's urgent."

Evelyn frowned. Gregory never dropped by unannounced unless something was wrong. "Send him in."

Gregory strode in moments later, his expression unreadable. He closed the door behind him before speaking. "We have a problem."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "What kind of problem?"

"The zoning permits for the waterfront project just got rejected."

Her stomach dropped. "What? Why?"

"Some last-minute objections from the environmental committee. They claim our designs don’t meet their new sustainability standards."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, frustration bubbling beneath her calm exterior. "That’s ridiculous. We followed every guideline."

Gregory ran a hand through his hair. "I know. But unless we get this sorted, the entire project is stalled."

She stood abruptly, determination hardening her gaze. "Then we’ll fix it. Call a meeting with the committee. I’ll handle Nathaniel—he needs to know before this blows up."

Gregory hesitated. "Are you sure? He’s already under a lot of pressure with the board."

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. "He’d want to know. We don’t keep secrets, especially not about something this big."

As Gregory left to arrange the meeting, Evelyn grabbed her phone, her fingers hovering over Nathaniel’s contact. She knew he was in back-to-back meetings today, but this couldn’t wait.

Before she could dial, her phone buzzed with an incoming call—Isabella’s name flashing on the screen.

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Why was she calling?

Swallowing her unease, she answered. "Isabella?"

"Evelyn," Isabella’s voice was smooth, almost too sweet. "I thought you should know—Nathaniel and I are meeting for lunch today. Just catching up, of course."

The words slithered down Evelyn’s spine like ice. She forced a light tone. "That’s nice. I’m sure he’ll enjoy it."

Isabella chuckled softly. "Oh, I’m sure he will. After all, we have so much… history."

The line went dead before Evelyn could respond.

She stared at her phone, her earlier resolve crumbling under the weight of doubt.

Nathaniel hadn’t mentioned anything about lunch with Isabella.

Why?

And more importantly—what else wasn’t he telling her?

"It's not like I'm out every night. This is only my second time, and never this late," Evelyn defended herself, avoiding Nathaniel's piercing gaze.

"Do you have any idea how reckless it is for you to wander alone after dark? Never again," Nathaniel commanded, his voice leaving no room for argument.

Evelyn stayed quiet, methodically unpacking the grocery bag and arranging items in the fridge.

Nathaniel, irritation simmering, stalked toward her and slammed the refrigerator door shut, caging her between his arms. "Evelyn, I’m speaking to you. Did you hear what I said?"

Their proximity was suffocating.

Evelyn startled, tilting her head up. His dark eyes bore into hers, sharp and unyielding.

"Evelyn, answer me," he repeated, his tone brooding.

"Understood," she murmured, then tried to push him away.

Does he not realize how stifling this is? she thought, her skin prickling with heat. Their breaths mingled, too close, too intimate.

But Nathaniel didn’t budge. His body was an immovable force, trapping her effortlessly.

Annoyed, Evelyn huffed, "Move."

"You don’t want me near you?" His gaze dropped to her lips, lingering, his voice roughening with something dangerous.

Evelyn recognized that shift—the quiet storm before his temper flared. Opposing him now would only make things worse.

She bit her lip, exhaling softly. "That’s not it."

"Prove it," he challenged.

Her pulse jumped. "I just did."

"Then look at me when you say it."

Reluctantly, she met his eyes. "It’s really not that."

His thumb brushed her chin, tilting her face up. "Then kiss me."

She stiffened. "Why?"

"Since when do we need reasons?"

"Is this an order?" she countered, pressing her lips together.

Nathaniel paused, then smirked. "Would you only do it if it were?"

"If it’s not, then can I refuse?"

His expression darkened. "So you only respond to commands?"

Evelyn held her ground, silent.

He tightened his grip, displeasure flashing in his eyes. "Give me one good reason."

She nearly scoffed. I don’t need a reason not to want to.

Instead, she said flatly, "There isn’t one. I just don’t feel like it."

Nathaniel’s jaw ticked. "Is that ‘not now’ or ‘not ever’?"

"What difference does it make?"

"Fine. If you won’t kiss me, then don’t. Clearly, you don’t listen to my grandfather—why would you listen to me?"

The guilt trip was obvious.

Evelyn frowned but refused to rise to it. "Can you let go so I can finish putting these away?"

"I’m not stopping you."

"Then step back."

He didn’t move. Not an inch.

After a tense silence, Evelyn sighed. "Why are you still here?"

"Evelyn, you can’t have it both ways. I didn’t force you to kiss me, and you can’t force me to leave when I don’t want to. Did you think I’d just let you push me around?"

"Nathaniel Martin!" she snapped, frustration boiling over.

His name on her lips—sharp, irritated—sent a thrill through him. His gaze darkened, a storm brewing beneath his composed exterior.

"I’m right here," he murmured, voice thick.

"Say my name again."

"Nathaniel, you’re insufferable."

Evelyn wanted to strangle him.

###Chapter 138

The moment Nathaniel stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, the air shifted. His presence commanded attention, his sharp gaze scanning the room with practiced ease. Evelyn stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her fingers tracing the intricate patterns of the glass. She could feel the weight of his stare before she even turned around.

"Evelyn," Nathaniel said, his voice low and steady.

She turned, meeting his eyes. "Nathaniel."

The tension between them was palpable, a silent battle of wills. The last time they had spoken, words had been exchanged—harsh, unforgiving. Now, standing in the opulent hall, surrounded by the echoes of their shared history, neither seemed willing to break the silence first.

Isabella's sudden appearance shattered the moment. She strode in, her heels clicking against the marble floor, a smirk playing on her lips. "Am I interrupting something?"

Evelyn clenched her jaw but forced a polite smile. "Not at all."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "What are you doing here, Isabella?"

Isabella feigned innocence, twirling a strand of her perfectly styled hair. "Just paying a visit to dear old Edward. You know how fond he is of me."

Evelyn resisted the urge to roll her eyes. Isabella had always been skilled at inserting herself where she wasn’t wanted.

Before the conversation could spiral further, Alfred, the butler, appeared. "Mr. Martin requests your presence in the study," he announced, his tone neutral.

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "We’ll be right there."

As Alfred retreated, Isabella leaned in, her voice dripping with false sweetness. "Don’t worry, Evelyn. I’ll make sure Nathaniel doesn’t forget about you."

Evelyn’s patience snapped. "Isabella, if you have something to say, say it plainly. Otherwise, spare us the theatrics."

Isabella’s smirk faltered, replaced by a flicker of irritation. "You always did think you were better than everyone else."

Nathaniel stepped between them, his voice cutting through the tension. "Enough. We have more important matters to attend to."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, turning on her heel. She didn’t wait for Nathaniel or Isabella to follow as she made her way toward the study. The weight of the past few weeks pressed down on her, but she refused to let it show.

Inside the study, Edward Martin sat behind his imposing desk, his sharp eyes assessing them as they entered. "Good. You’re all here."

Evelyn folded her arms. "What’s this about?"

Edward steepled his fingers. "The Summit Realty deal. It’s time to make a decision."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "We’ve already discussed this."

Edward’s gaze flicked to Isabella, then back to Nathaniel. "Circumstances have changed."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. She knew exactly what that meant. Isabella had somehow weaseled her way into the deal. Again.

Edward leaned forward. "The board wants assurances. Stability."

Nathaniel’s voice was ice. "And you think bringing Isabella into this provides stability?"

Edward’s expression remained unreadable. "I think it’s time to consider all options."

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms. She had fought too hard to let Isabella undermine everything now.

But before she could speak, Nathaniel’s phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his expression shifting. "I have to take this."

As he stepped out, Isabella smirked. "Looks like you’re losing your grip, Evelyn."

Evelyn met her gaze evenly. "We’ll see about that."

The door clicked shut behind Nathaniel, leaving Evelyn alone with Isabella and Edward. The game had just gotten more complicated.

And Evelyn was done playing nice.

Nathaniel's lips curled into a smirk, his eyes glinting with mischief. "You're already annoyed with me when I haven't even done anything? What if I actually did something? Would you cry then?"

His words carried a suggestive undertone, and it took Evelyn a moment to catch his meaning. Heat rushed to her cheeks.

Instinctively, she pressed closer to his chest, though it did little to shield her from his teasing. She steadied her breathing, forcing her voice to remain calm. "What do you want?"

"I haven't done anything, and you refuse to kiss me. Am I not even allowed to stand here?" His low chuckle sent a shiver down her spine.

Evelyn finally understood.

He wasn’t threatening her with words—he was doing it with actions.

Taking a deep breath, she rose onto her toes and brushed her lips against his in a fleeting kiss. Her mouth was cool, barely grazing his before she tried to pull away.

But Nathaniel wasn’t having it.

The moment she initiated, warmth flooded his dark eyes. He seized control, deepening the kiss until her breath hitched.

It lasted far too long. By the time he finally released her, Evelyn was gasping for air.

Yet he didn’t let go. Instead, he buried his face in the crook of her neck, his voice rough and thick with desire. "I'm hungry."

She knew exactly what he meant but feigned ignorance. "I can make you spaghetti."

"Evelyn," he murmured, his breath hot against her skin. "You know what I want."

"I don’t."

"You will."

Without another word, he scooped her up and carried her straight to the bedroom.

Evelyn didn’t resist. Memories of their last encounter flashed through her mind, and she knew she couldn’t use her cycle as an excuse again. Reluctantly, she gave in, silently praying he’d finish quickly.

But her thoughts were elsewhere—on the tiny life growing inside her.

Nathaniel noticed.

His grip tightened as he studied her face, his voice dropping to a husky whisper. "Do you hate it when I touch you?"

"No."

"Then why do you look so cold?"

"I’m just tired."

He scoffed, pinching her chin. "Tired from doing nothing?"

"I’ve been working a lot. That’s all."

"Just that?"

"Yeah."

She wasn’t sure if he believed her, but he loosened his hold.

By the time they finished, it was nearly midnight.

Exhausted, Evelyn curled onto her side, one hand instinctively cradling her stomach. Nathaniel draped the blanket over her and murmured, "Want me to carry you to the shower?"

"Not now."

He didn’t push it, heading to the bathroom alone.

The moment the water turned on, Evelyn reached for her phone. Her fingers flew over the screen as she messaged Caroline, her anxiety spilling into the brief text.

Caroline’s reply came swiftly—everything was fine.

Relief washed over her. She deleted the conversation and set the phone aside, too drained to stay awake any longer.

Sleep claimed her instantly, dreamless and deep.

The next morning, sunlight streamed through the windows, rousing her early.

After a quick shower, she warmed milk and prepared breakfast—simple, light dishes. Once done, she returned to the bedroom.

She had work today and needed to bring the design sketches she’d been working on at home. Opening the bedside drawer, she pulled out her notebook.

A crumpled piece of paper slipped out with it.

Frowning, she picked it up, intending to toss it away—until her fingers brushed against something unusual.

She unfolded it.

And froze.

Her blood turned to ice as she read the words scrawled across the page.

###Chapter 139

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort in the Maldives. The design was nearly perfect, but something nagged at her.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn straightened. "Send him in."

Gregory Wilson strode in, his usual confident demeanor slightly off. He dropped into the chair opposite her, running a hand through his hair. "We have a problem."

Her stomach tightened. "What is it?"

"The Maldives project—Summit Realty just pulled their funding."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "What? Why?"

Gregory exhaled sharply. "Sebastian Wilson claims our designs don’t align with their vision. He wants a complete overhaul."

Her fingers curled into fists. "That’s impossible. We’ve already revised it twice."

Gregory’s gaze darkened. "I think this is personal. He’s still bitter about losing the last bid to Nathaniel."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. Nathaniel. Just the mention of his name sent a jolt through her. Their last argument still hung between them, unresolved.

She forced herself to focus. "We’ll handle this. Set up a meeting with Sebastian. I’ll make him see reason."

Gregory hesitated. "There’s more. Isabella Davis is back in town."

Evelyn froze. Isabella—Nathaniel’s ex, the woman who had once shattered his heart.

A cold dread settled in her chest. "Why now?"

Gregory shrugged. "Rumor has it she’s here to reclaim what she lost."

Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel: We need to talk.

Her fingers trembled as she typed a reply. About what?

The response came instantly. Isabella.

The air left her lungs.

Gregory studied her. "You okay?"

She forced a smile. "Fine. Just another day in paradise."

But as he left, Evelyn stared at the blueprints, her vision blurring.

Everything was unraveling.

And she wasn’t sure she could stop it.

Evelyn held the document firmly in her grasp, tucking it into the pocket of her blazer before retrieving her notebook and exiting the bedroom. She placed it carefully into her work bag by the front door.

Her expression remained unreadable, but the ice in her gaze was unmistakable.

She waited silently for Nathaniel to wake. When he finally emerged, they sat across from each other at the breakfast table, the air thick with tension.

Nathaniel studied her impassively as he took a sip of coffee. "You're up early. Shouldn't you be resting?"

"I have work," Evelyn replied curtly.

"Take another day off. You look exhausted," he suggested, his tone edged with something unreadable.

"Don't you have meetings?" she countered instead of answering.

Nathaniel's brow twitched. "Samuel is picking me up later. I have a lunch appointment."

"Good." Evelyn finished her tea, dabbing her lips with a napkin before meeting his eyes. "I'll pack your things. You can take them with you when you leave."

Nathaniel's grip on his coffee cup tightened, his expression darkening instantly. "What the hell does that mean?"

"Exactly what it sounds like. Your fever's gone. There's no reason for you to stay here any longer. Pineview Villa is more comfortable for you," she said, her voice steady.

"So you're throwing me out?" His voice was sharp, dangerous.

"If that's how you want to see it."

No sugarcoating. No softening the blow.

Nathaniel's lips curled into a cold smirk. "Evelyn, you're unbelievable. Is this because I didn't fuck you well enough last night?"

Her fingers clenched around her napkin, but she refused to let him rattle her. Keeping her voice even, she replied, "That's not it."

"Better not be, or I'll make sure you regret saying that," he threatened, pushing back from the table.

Evelyn stood as well. "Nathaniel, just go back to Pineview. We both need space."

"Fine. I'll leave. But you're coming with me," he declared.

"No."

His jaw tightened. "Evelyn, you asked for time. I gave you days. But this separation bullshit ends now. Either you move back in with me, or we buy this damn apartment and live here together."

She exhaled sharply, frustration simmering beneath her calm exterior. "Nathaniel, doesn't this feel wrong to you?"

His eyes flashed. "So the last two days meant nothing to you? Was all of that just an act?"

She didn’t answer.

"Answer me!" His voice was a whip-crack command.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, her resolve wavering—but when she looked up, her gaze was steel. "Yes. It feels wrong. So please, just go."

Nathaniel leaned in, his voice low and dangerous. "Say that again, Evelyn. I dare you."

Her fingers trembled slightly as she reached into her pocket and pulled out the crumpled document she'd found in the drawer. She tossed it onto the table between them.

"I'll say it as many times as I have to. Because I don't believe you're staying here to fix our marriage. You're just playing games with me."

Nathaniel's eyes flicked to the paper, a shadow of something—guilt?—passing over his face before his mask slipped back into place.

"You want me gone because of this?" His voice was flat.

"Isn't this enough? Or do you think it's nothing?" Evelyn shot back.

###Chapter 140

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort in the Maldives. The design was ambitious, but she thrived on challenges.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn straightened, smoothing her blouse. "Send him in."

Gregory Wilson strode in, his usual confident demeanor slightly off. His tie was loosened, and there was a tension in his jaw she hadn’t seen before.

"You look like you’ve had a morning," she remarked, gesturing for him to sit.

He exhaled sharply. "You could say that. Summit Realty just pulled out of the Montclair deal."

Evelyn’s pen stilled. "What? That was our biggest contract this quarter."

"Sebastian Wilson claims budget cuts," Gregory said, rubbing his temples. "But I heard through the grapevine that they’re shifting focus to Isabella Davis’s new development."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. Isabella—Nathaniel’s ex, the woman who had once tried to sabotage her marriage. Now she was encroaching on her professional life too?

She forced a calm tone. "We’ll find another investor. The Montclair project is too good to abandon."

Gregory hesitated. "There’s more. Nathaniel’s grandfather called an emergency board meeting. Rumor has it, he’s reconsidering Nathaniel’s position as heir."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. "Why?"

"Something about ‘instability’ in his personal life." Gregory’s gaze flickered to her left hand—her wedding ring gleaming under the light.

A cold realization settled over her. This wasn’t just about business. Someone was playing a deeper game, and she and Nathaniel were the pawns.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel: We need to talk. Tonight.

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the device. Whatever was coming, they’d face it together. But first, she had a few calls to make.

"Gabrielle," she called out, her voice steady. "Get me Jonathan Blake on the line. And cancel my afternoon meetings."

If Isabella wanted a war, Evelyn would make sure she was ready.

What truly haunted her were the specifics.

Even knowing she would agonize and blame herself, he went through with it. He'd rather endure the fever without medication, just to twist the knife of guilt deeper into her heart.

Evelyn pressed on, bringing it up again. "Nathaniel, divorce would be the best solution for both of us. You can marry Isabella, and I can finally have my freedom."

"Are you doing this for my sake? Should I be grateful?" Nathaniel scoffed, his voice dripping with sarcasm.

Evelyn met his gaze evenly. "No gratitude necessary. It's a practical decision."

His eyes darkened. "If you think I'll marry Isabella after this, then what about you? Who’s waiting for you—Gregory? Or Samuel?"

"Why does divorce have to end in marriage? I’m perfectly content alone," she shot back.

Nathaniel’s lips curled into a mocking smile. "So you’re dead set on this?"

"Yes."

"Prove it, then. Give me a reason to agree," he challenged before turning sharply and striding toward the door.

A heartbeat later, the slam of the door reverberated through the room, leaving behind a suffocating silence.

Evelyn remained frozen. This was what she wanted—what she needed—to secure her child’s future.

Yet, beneath the resolve, an oppressive weight settled in her chest, making each breath a struggle. A dull ache pulsed where her heart should have been numb.

She bit her lip hard enough to draw blood, forcing the emotions down until they were locked away.

Then, mechanically, she cleared the dining table, changed into fresh clothes, and left for the office.

Thanks to Nathaniel, she was two days behind. While Gregory had kept things running, relying on him indefinitely wasn’t an option.

The moment she stepped into her office, she dove into reviewing project updates. It wasn’t long before Gregory knocked.

"Evelyn, the Mitchell Group just called. They’re pulling out of the collaboration due to our delayed response," he informed her.

She had nearly forgotten—not that she ever intended to work with them.

"Let them go," she said flatly.

Gregory hesitated. "Since your marriage to Nathaniel went public, they have other options." His gaze lingered, searching for a reaction.

Evelyn barely glanced up. "I never wanted it public. But what’s done is done." Her voice was hollow, her smile brittle.

His brow furrowed. "You don’t have to live like this. Not if he doesn’t love you."

"Gregory." Her tone turned icy, her posture rigid. "I’m aware. You don’t need to remind me."

Realizing his misstep, he backtracked. "Evelyn, I didn’t mean—I just hate seeing you like this."

"I know. You can go. I have work to do." She dismissed him without looking up.

With no choice, he left, shutting the door softly behind him.

Alone, Evelyn exhaled, a flicker of self-loathing crossing her face.

Gregory wasn’t wrong. But facing the truth was another matter entirely.

After a beat, she opened her laptop and typed two words:

Divorce Agreement.



###Chapter 141

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, her fingers brushing against the cool silk sheets as she blinked away the remnants of sleep. Beside her, Nathaniel lay still, his breathing steady, his dark lashes casting faint shadows against his cheeks.

She studied him for a moment—the sharp line of his jaw, the way his lips parted slightly in slumber. Even in sleep, he exuded an air of quiet authority, the kind that had once intimidated her but now felt like home.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand, pulling her from her thoughts. A message from Gregory flashed on the screen:

"Meeting at 10. The investors are getting restless. We need to finalize the blueprints."

Evelyn sighed, rubbing her temples. The pressure of the new project weighed on her, but she refused to let it show. Not when Nathaniel had his own battles to fight—his grandfather’s declining health, the whispers of dissent within Martin Group.

She slipped out of bed, careful not to wake him, and padded toward the ensuite bathroom. The marble tiles were cool beneath her bare feet as she splashed water on her face, willing herself to focus.

When she emerged, Nathaniel was awake, propped up on one elbow, watching her with those piercing blue eyes.

"Morning," he murmured, his voice rough with sleep.

"Morning," she replied, forcing a smile.

He frowned. "You're worrying again."

She hesitated, then exhaled. "Gregory says the investors are pushing for answers. We can’t afford delays."

Nathaniel sat up, the sheets pooling around his waist. "Let me handle them."

Evelyn shook her head. "No. This is my project. I need to see it through."

He studied her for a long moment before nodding. "Alright. But if they give you trouble, you call me."

She smirked. "What, are you going to intimidate them with your CEO glare?"

His lips twitched. "If that’s what it takes."

A knock at the door interrupted them. Alfred’s voice came through, polite but firm. "Mr. Martin, your grandfather is requesting your presence."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "Tell him I’ll be there shortly."

Evelyn reached for his hand, squeezing it gently. "Go. I’ll be fine."

He pressed a kiss to her knuckles before rising, his tall frame moving with effortless grace. As he dressed, Evelyn watched him, a pang of unease settling in her chest.

Something was coming. She could feel it in the air—a storm brewing beneath the surface.

And she wasn’t sure if they were ready for it.

Downstairs, the grand dining room was bathed in soft morning light. Edward Martin sat at the head of the table, his frail hands clasped over his cane. His sharp gaze flickered to Nathaniel as he entered.

"You’re late," Edward said, his voice thin but firm.

Nathaniel took his seat without apology. "What do you need, Grandfather?"

Edward’s lips thinned. "I’ve received word that Isabella is back in the city."

A muscle ticked in Nathaniel’s jaw. "And?"

"And," Edward continued, his tone icy, "she’s been seen with Donovan Sinclair."

Evelyn, who had just stepped into the room, froze at the threshold.

Donovan Sinclair—the man whose name was synonymous with danger, with secrets buried deep.

Nathaniel’s eyes met hers, a silent warning flashing between them.

The storm had arrived.

From memory, Evelyn meticulously reconstructed the agreement Nathaniel had previously provided. Her fingers flew across the keyboard with mechanical precision, each keystroke echoing like a death knell for their marriage.

The printer hummed to life, spitting out the damning document. When her elegant signature - "Evelyn" - materialized beside "Authorized by", the finality of it stole her breath. This single flourish of ink marked the beginning of their end.

No turning back now. She couldn't afford hesitation, not when every second of delay threatened to weaken her resolve.

Sealing the envelope felt like entombing her heart. She instructed a courier to deliver it directly to Nathaniel's office at Martin Group headquarters. As the deliveryman disappeared through the glass doors, Evelyn collapsed into her ergonomic chair, her vibrant eyes now dull mirrors reflecting nothing but emptiness.

She'd believed herself prepared for this moment. The pain still came like a sucker punch to the gut. Asking the man she loved for divorce was more excruciating than she'd ever imagined.

Her gaze dropped to her still-flat abdomen as time lost all meaning. The shrill ring of her phone shattered the silence.

Nathaniel's name flashed on the screen. She answered to his icy demand: "Explain this, Evelyn."

"My intentions should be perfectly clear," she replied, her voice steadier than she felt, watching sunlight dance across the Manhattan skyline.

Could he hear the tremor in her breathing? Detect the way her nails dug into her palm?

His next words came laced with frost: "So divorce is your only solution?"

"Tell me, Nathaniel," she challenged, "your resistance makes me wonder - have you fallen for me? After all this time?" The question escaped her lips for the third time, though she already knew the answer.

His behavior confused her. If he didn't love her, why cling to this hollow marriage? Was it mere habit after a year together? Or perhaps maintaining appearances served his purposes while he pursued his true love?

The thought sickened her. If not for the life growing inside her, she might have continued waiting. But now, someone more precious needed her protection.

The line crackled with tension.

After thirty excruciating seconds, Nathaniel responded with calculated calm: "Since when did love become a requirement? Our marriage never needed it before. Are you certain about this, Evelyn?"

His first direct answer to her persistent question. It confirmed everything she'd feared.

"I'm certain," she said, voice breaking. "If we're both considering divorce, then separation is our best path forward."

"Unacceptable." His tone turned steely. "We just went public. A divorce now would devastate Martin Group's reputation and affect thousands of employees. I won't allow it."

Evelyn countered bitterly: "We kept our marriage secret for a year. If you hadn't revealed it, no one would associate us now. What's stopping us from keeping our divorce private too?"

"So this is my fault?" His anger vibrated through the receiver.

She bit her lip until she tasted copper, the silence between them thickening.

A muffled interruption came from his end - Samuel's voice reminding Nathaniel of an impending meeting.

His final words struck like a whip: "I'm giving you time to reconsider, Evelyn. But my answer remains no. Understood?"

The line went dead before she could respond.
###Chapter 142

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady, one arm draped protectively over her waist. She smiled, tracing the faint scar on his jaw—a remnant from the accident that had nearly taken him from her.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory: "Emergency meeting at the office. Summit Realty is making moves."

Evelyn sighed. She had hoped for a quiet morning, but business never waited. Carefully, she slipped out from under Nathaniel’s arm, pressing a featherlight kiss to his temple before heading to the shower.

By the time she emerged, wrapped in a plush robe, Nathaniel was awake, sitting on the edge of the bed with his phone in hand. His expression was unreadable.

"Summit Realty?" she guessed, toweling her hair dry.

He nodded. "Sebastian Wilson is pushing forward with the waterfront project. He’s undercutting our bids."

Evelyn’s grip tightened on the towel. "He can’t just—"

"He can," Nathaniel cut in, standing. "And he will, unless we act fast."

She met his gaze, the intensity in his dark eyes sending a shiver down her spine. "Then let’s not waste time."

The office was in chaos when they arrived. Gabrielle, Evelyn’s assistant, rushed over, her tablet clutched tightly. "Gregory’s in the conference room with Jonathan Blake. Summit’s already sent revised contracts to our clients."

Evelyn’s jaw clenched. "Pull every file on the waterfront project. I want every loophole, every weakness in their proposal."

Gabrielle nodded and hurried off. Nathaniel’s phone rang—Samuel, his secretary. "Sir, Edward Martin is on line one. He wants an update."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "Tell him we’re handling it."

Evelyn touched his arm. "We are handling it."

His gaze softened slightly before he turned to address the team gathering in the conference room.

Hours later, Evelyn leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples. The numbers weren’t adding up. Summit’s bid was suspiciously low—too low.

"There’s no way they’re turning a profit with these figures," Gregory muttered, flipping through the documents.

"Unless they’re cutting corners," Evelyn said slowly.

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened. "Or hiding something."

A knock interrupted them. Gabrielle stepped in, her expression uneasy. "You have a visitor. Isabella Davis."

The room went still.

Evelyn’s fingers curled into fists under the table. "What does she want?"

Gabrielle hesitated. "She says it’s about Summit Realty."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Send her in."

The door opened, and Isabella strode in, her designer heels clicking against the floor. She looked as polished as ever, her smile razor-sharp.

"Long time no see," she said, her gaze flickering between them. "I hear you’re having a little problem with Sebastian Wilson."

Evelyn forced herself to stay calm. "What do you know about it?"

Isabella crossed her arms. "Enough to make it worth your while to listen."

Nathaniel’s voice was ice. "Get to the point."

She smirked. "Let’s just say… I have information that could bury Summit Realty. But it’ll cost you."

Evelyn exchanged a glance with Nathaniel. Whatever game Isabella was playing, they couldn’t afford to ignore it.

Not when so much was at stake.

The tension in the room was suffocating. Evelyn’s mind raced. Trusting Isabella was a risk—but so was doing nothing.

Nathaniel’s hand found hers under the table, squeezing gently. A silent promise: Whatever happens, we face it together.

Evelyn took a deep breath. "Alright, Isabella. Talk."

The smirk on Isabella’s lips widened.

And just like that, the game changed.

Nathaniel's voice was sharp, leaving no room for argument. He didn’t wait for Evelyn’s response before ending the call abruptly.

His phone clattered onto the desk as he yanked at his tie, his sculpted fingers moving with barely restrained frustration. His gaze darkened, flickering toward Samuel with a chilling intensity. "Go to Martin Manor," he ordered. "Have my mother find out what Evelyn truly wants."

Why is she so determined to end this?

Is it really just because I don’t love her?

Does love matter that much?

Am I not enough?

The questions burned in his mind, unanswered. His jaw clenched as his eyes landed on the divorce papers sprawled across his desk. With a swift, violent motion, he tore them apart, scattering the pieces into the trash bin.

Then, without another word, he strode out of the office, his steps heavy with barely contained fury.

Samuel hesitated, catching a glimpse of the shredded document in the bin. The word divorce stood out starkly among the fragments, sending a jolt of shock through him. But he knew better than to question Nathaniel now. Swallowing his surprise, he hurried after his boss.

The tension in Martin Group was palpable that morning.

Nathaniel’s temper was a storm waiting to break. During the quarterly financial review, an oversight was uncovered—a misplaced decimal point that had cost the company nearly ten million in taxes.

His piercing glare swept over the trembling financial directors. "Am I paying you to sabotage my company?" His voice was dangerously low. "If you can’t do your jobs, get out. If you can, prove it."

No one dared to meet his eyes.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, his hands resting on his hips. "Who here is willing to take responsibility for this loss? Speak up."

Silence.

The chief financial director wiped his brow, his voice shaking. "Mr. Martin, it was an honest mistake. We can correct it if given another chance—"

"I am giving you a chance," Nathaniel cut in, his tone glacial. "But tell me—who’s accountable? You? Or me?"

The man faltered, his mouth opening and closing uselessly.

Nathaniel snatched the file from the desk and flung it at them. "If this hadn’t been caught in time, do you think you’d still have the privilege of standing here?"

The mistake had only been discovered because of the company’s rigorous financial checks—first by the internal team, then by the directors, and finally by the elusive auditor who operated remotely from abroad.

No one knew the auditor’s identity, but their sharp eye had saved Martin Group more than once.

The directors stammered apologies, their faces pale with fear.

Nathaniel’s patience was wearing thin when Samuel’s voice cut through the tension. "Mr. Martin, Ms. Davis is calling."

"Do I look like I have time for this?" Nathaniel snapped. "If I have to handle every call myself, what’s your purpose here, Samuel? Do you still want this job?"

Samuel stiffened. "Understood, sir. I’ll handle it." He stepped out immediately, rejecting Isabella’s call without hesitation.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, waving a dismissive hand at the room. "Get out."

Once they were alone again, Samuel returned.

Nathaniel’s voice was eerily calm now. "Investigate them. I want to know if this was negligence—or something more deliberate."



###Chapter 143

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She studied his face—the sharp angles of his jaw, the faint scar near his temple from a childhood accident. Even in sleep, he exuded an air of quiet authority.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory: "Meeting moved to 10 AM. The client wants revisions."

Evelyn sighed. Another last-minute change. She slipped out of bed, careful not to disturb Nathaniel, and padded to the ensuite bathroom. The cool tiles beneath her feet grounded her as she splashed water on her face.

Downstairs, Alfred had already set out breakfast—fresh fruit, a steaming pot of coffee, and warm croissants. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted with a slight bow.

"Morning, Alfred," she murmured, pouring herself a cup of coffee. The rich aroma filled her senses, momentarily easing the tension in her shoulders.

The front door opened, and Isabella strode in, her designer heels clicking against the marble floor. She wore a fitted blazer and dark sunglasses, her lips painted a bold red. "Evelyn," she said, removing her shades. "We need to talk."

Evelyn’s grip tightened around her mug. "About?"

Isabella smirked. "Nathaniel, of course."

A chill ran down Evelyn’s spine. She forced herself to remain composed. "Whatever you have to say, make it quick. I have a meeting."

Isabella leaned in, her voice dropping to a whisper. "He’s keeping secrets from you. Big ones."

Before Evelyn could respond, Nathaniel’s voice cut through the tension. "Isabella." He stood at the top of the staircase, his expression unreadable. "What are you doing here?"

Isabella straightened, her smirk widening. "Just catching up with your wife."

Nathaniel descended the stairs, his gaze never leaving Isabella. "Leave."

The command was sharp, final. Isabella hesitated, then shrugged. "Fine. But Evelyn deserves to know the truth." With that, she turned on her heel and left.

Silence settled over the room. Evelyn turned to Nathaniel. "What was that about?"

He ran a hand through his hair, exhaling sharply. "Nothing important. Just her usual games."

Evelyn studied him. There was something in his eyes—something guarded. "Nathaniel," she pressed. "If there’s something I should know—"

He cupped her face, cutting her off. "Trust me."

The words should have reassured her. But as she looked into his eyes, all she felt was doubt.

Her phone buzzed again. Gregory: "Where are you? The client’s here."

Evelyn stepped back. "I have to go."

Nathaniel nodded. "We’ll talk tonight."

As she grabbed her bag and headed for the door, one thought echoed in her mind: What is he hiding?

The drive to the office was a blur. When she arrived, Gregory was pacing outside the conference room. "Finally," he muttered. "They’re waiting."

Evelyn took a deep breath and pushed open the door. Inside, the client—Jonathan Blake from Summit Realty—sat with his arms crossed. "About time," he said, glancing at his watch.

She forced a smile. "Apologies for the delay. Let’s get started."

But as the meeting progressed, Evelyn’s mind kept drifting back to Isabella’s words. Secrets.

And the unsettling feeling that her perfect life was about to unravel.

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "Understood. I'll look into it immediately."

With that, he turned to leave the boardroom.

Sebastian spoke up again. "What did Isabella want?"

Nathaniel paused briefly before answering, "She asked when you'd be available to accompany her to her therapy session. I informed her you were in a meeting and couldn’t be disturbed. Anything urgent would have to wait."

Sebastian's expression remained unreadable, his voice low and rough. "Fine."

Samuel studied him for a moment before Nathaniel asked, "Did you reach my mother?"

"I did, but she said—"

"What?"

"She said you should deal with your own wife yourself." Samuel risked his job delivering that message.

Nathaniel's eyes darkened, his jaw tightening as silence stretched between them.

Samuel took the hint and swiftly exited, leaving Nathaniel alone in the vast, empty room.

Evelyn's cold, unyielding words echoed in his mind. He had never seen her so ruthless before—her usual gentleness had been nothing but a facade.

The realization made his handsome face turn stormy. His lips pressed into a thin line, his entire body tense as a drawn bowstring, as if he might shatter at any moment.

He remained seated there for what felt like hours until Samuel knocked again, this time with an urgent report.

After ending the call with Nathaniel, Evelyn sat in silence for a long while before forcing herself back to work.

But barely ten minutes later, her phone buzzed again.

She frowned, then immediately answered when she saw the caller ID. "Victoria?"

"Evelyn, are you busy?"

"Not at all. What’s wrong?"

"You haven’t visited the Martin estate in days. Edward’s been worried, so he asked me to invite you to lunch—just the two of us."

Evelyn checked the time. "Of course. What would you like? I’ll make reservations."

"No need for formalities between family. I’ll wait downstairs at your office. Once you’re done, we’ll grab lunch and maybe do some shopping?"

Evelyn’s frown softened into reluctant amusement. Mostly, though, she felt warmth.

Because Victoria treated her with the kindness of a real mother—the kind Evelyn had always wished for.

Of course, she wouldn’t make Victoria wait outside. She immediately instructed Gabrielle to escort her upstairs.

Victoria, ever thoughtful, had come prepared. Knowing Evelyn wouldn’t let her linger, she brought along gourmet pastries and artisanal coffee—all trending recommendations from influencers.

Since Evelyn’s team was young and lively, they were thrilled by the treats. "Thank you, Mrs. Martin!"

"Just call me Victoria," she said warmly. "And thank you for supporting Evelyn so well. Your hard work doesn’t go unnoticed."

Her genuine, down-to-earth demeanor instantly won them over.

Gabrielle then guided her to Evelyn’s office. As they passed Gregory’s door, Victoria caught his gaze—cold and indifferent—but she still offered a polite smile and nod.

Quietly, she asked, "Who’s that?"

Gabrielle followed her glance. "Mr. Wilson. He’s Ms. Mitchell’s business partner and co-founder."



###Chapter 144

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, she felt the weight of countless eyes on her. The air was thick with tension, the kind that made her fingers curl instinctively around the strap of her purse.

Nathaniel stood by the fireplace, his expression unreadable. The flickering flames cast shadows across his sharp features, making him look even more imposing than usual.

"Evelyn," he said, his voice low but firm. "We need to talk."

She swallowed hard, her heart pounding. "About what?"

Isabella chose that exact moment to make her entrance. Dressed in a sleek black dress that hugged her curves, she sauntered in with a smirk. "Oh, don’t stop on my account," she purred, her gaze flickering between them.

Evelyn clenched her jaw. She had known this confrontation was coming, but she hadn’t expected it to happen like this—not with Isabella watching, clearly enjoying every second of it.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "Not now, Isabella."

Isabella merely shrugged, leaning against the doorway. "Fine. But you can’t avoid the truth forever, Nathaniel."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. What truth? What was she missing?

Gregory, who had been standing quietly near the window, finally spoke up. "Evelyn, maybe we should step outside."

She shook her head. "No. Whatever this is, I want to hear it now."

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened. "It’s about the project. There’s been a complication."

Evelyn frowned. "What kind of complication?"

Before he could answer, Samuel hurried into the room, his face pale. "Sir, we have a problem. The investors are pulling out."

A heavy silence fell over the room. Evelyn’s stomach twisted. This couldn’t be happening. Not after everything they’d worked for.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Why?"

Samuel hesitated, then glanced at Isabella. "They’ve been approached with another offer. A more... lucrative one."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. She turned to Nathaniel, searching his face for answers. "Did you know about this?"

His silence was answer enough.

Isabella smirked. "Looks like you’re not the only one with connections, Evelyn."

The words were like a slap. Evelyn took a step back, her mind racing. This wasn’t just about the project anymore. This was about trust. And right now, hers was hanging by a thread.

Nathaniel reached for her, but she sidestepped him. "I need some air," she muttered before turning on her heel and walking out.

The cool evening breeze did little to calm the storm inside her. She had trusted Nathaniel with everything—her heart, her career, her future. And now? Now she wasn’t sure of anything.

As she stood there, staring at the sprawling gardens, one thought echoed in her mind: What else was he hiding?

Victoria nodded in comprehension, though she had an inkling this individual might prove challenging. Still, she held her tongue, unwilling to complicate matters for Evelyn.

When she stepped into Evelyn’s office, Evelyn immediately stood to welcome her. "Victoria, from now on, just come straight up. No need to wait downstairs. If I’m busy, you can relax here until I’m free."

"Can I visit often?"

"Of course."

"Evelyn, you’re the best." Victoria’s smile was radiant, her affection unmistakable—even to Gabrielle, who stood nearby.

Mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law didn’t have to be adversaries—not if they got along.

Gabrielle, sensing the moment was private, murmured, "Ms. Mitchell, Mrs. Martin, I’ll leave you to chat. I’ll be outside if you need anything."

"Thank you," Victoria replied politely.

Once the door clicked shut, Victoria unpacked the pastries she’d brought. "I shared some with the team downstairs, but I saved your favorites. Sit, try them."

Evelyn obliged, accepting the slice of cake.

Victoria glanced around the office, admiration softening her features. "Evelyn, you’re remarkable. Am I the first family member to visit you here?"

She likely was.

Nathaniel’s last visit hadn’t exactly been social.

Evelyn nodded. "Yes."

"Then I’m honored." Victoria’s voice warmed. "You’re extraordinary, Evelyn. A woman with her own career—that’s perfection."

Evelyn chuckled. "Victoria, if you keep flattering me, I might start believing it."

"Every word is true. Do you think I’d lie?"

"Never. I know you mean it."

Evelyn took another bite of cake.

Truthfully, she wasn’t fond of sweets, but she indulged out of appreciation for Victoria’s thoughtfulness.

As Evelyn resumed work, Victoria occupied herself quietly, observing the younger woman’s focus with quiet pride.

Then, an idea struck.

Victoria discreetly raised her phone, recording Evelyn’s concentrated expression before sending the clip to Nathaniel.

"Your wife is working hard. I never realized how captivating a woman looks when she’s absorbed in her craft, Nathaniel. If you weren’t my son, I’d say she’s out of your league."

A mother’s honesty was brutal.

She snapped a few more photos, adding: "If you let a woman like this slip away, you’ll regret it for life. Don’t come crying to me later."

After sending the media, Victoria stopped. Getting caught would be awkward, and she didn’t want Nathaniel blaming her if things backfired.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel remained oblivious to his mother’s lack of faith in him. He stared at the images on his phone, jaw tight. After a long pause, he typed: "There are no ‘ifs.’"

Victoria rolled her eyes and fired back: "Nathaniel, don’t be overconfident. A woman like Evelyn has admirers. That Gregory from her firm? He’s a serious contender. He wasn’t exactly warm to me—because of you. Tread carefully."

A mother’s warning.

Nathaniel scoffed, replying: "You think he’s a threat to me?"

###Chapter 145

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden streaks across her drafting table. She leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples as she reviewed the final blueprints for the Martin Group's latest project. The weight of responsibility pressed on her shoulders, but she refused to let it show.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called.

The door swung open, revealing Gabrielle, her assistant, holding a steaming cup of coffee. "Thought you might need this," Gabrielle said with a knowing smile.

Evelyn accepted it gratefully. "You're a lifesaver."

Gabrielle hesitated, then added, "Nathaniel called earlier. He said he’d be late for dinner tonight—another emergency meeting."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the cup. "Again?"

Gabrielle nodded sympathetically. "He asked if you could meet him at the penthouse later."

Evelyn exhaled slowly. "Fine. I’ll wrap things up here first."

As Gabrielle left, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A message from Isabella flashed on the screen:

"We need to talk. It’s urgent."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. She hadn’t spoken to Isabella since the gala incident, and the last thing she wanted was another confrontation. But something in Isabella’s tone made her hesitate.

She typed a quick reply: "About what?"

The response was immediate. "Nathaniel. And the truth you don’t know."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. What truth?

Before she could reply, another message popped up—this time from Nathaniel: "Don’t believe anything she says. I’ll explain everything tonight."

Evelyn stared at the conflicting messages, her mind racing. What game was Isabella playing now? And why was Nathaniel so quick to dismiss her?

She set her phone down, her earlier exhaustion replaced by a surge of restless energy. Whatever was coming, she wouldn’t back down.

But first, she had a meeting with Gregory Wilson.

Pushing her chair back, Evelyn grabbed her blazer and strode out of the office, determination hardening her features.

Tonight, she would get answers—one way or another.

Evelyn mused to herself, He might not be concerned, but he certainly isn’t treating this with the gravity it deserves.

She didn’t respond to Nathaniel because Victoria had just finished her tasks and was gathering her things. Glancing at Evelyn, she asked, "Evelyn, have you decided where we’re eating?"

Evelyn nodded. "Let’s get steak. We women deserve a little indulgence too."

The phrase we women made Victoria smirk. Evelyn really knows how to keep things lively.

"Alright, whatever you prefer," Victoria agreed.

Hand in hand, they left the office. Evelyn paused to tell Gabrielle, "I might not return this afternoon. If anything urgent comes up, contact Mr. Wilson."

Gabrielle gave a quick nod.

As they passed Gregory’s office, Evelyn turned to Victoria. "Wait here a moment."

"Of course," Victoria replied.

Evelyn knocked on Gregory’s door. "Gregory, I’m heading out. Call me if anything needs attention."

"Go ahead, drive safely," Gregory said with a warm smile, his tone soft.

Evelyn returned the smile before rejoining Victoria.

In the elevator, Victoria casually ventured, "Evelyn, is that Gregory… your business partner?"

Evelyn nodded absently. "We’ve known each other for years. Good friends, too."

"Oh," Victoria murmured.

Nathaniel is being far too careless. How does he expect to compete like this?

She pressed further. "Does he have a girlfriend?"

Evelyn blinked, studying Victoria’s expression. "Not that I know of."

"Still single?" Victoria echoed, her smile tightening slightly.

Evelyn tilted her head. "Victoria, is there something you want to ask?"

Victoria shook her head. "Just thinking—he seems like a great guy. It’s a shame if he’s unattached. I know plenty of single women. Maybe I could introduce someone? What do you think?"

Evelyn exhaled. "I wouldn’t, Victoria. If it’s meant to happen, it will. Forcing it might make things awkward. Let’s leave it be, alright?"

"Fine, just a passing thought. Don’t overthink it."

"Good."

They drove to an upscale bistro.

Victoria had reserved a table by the window.

Once seated, Evelyn slid the menu toward her. "Why don’t you order?"

"What are you craving?"

"Anything’s fine."

Victoria requested two bowls of corn chowder, a salmon salad, two steaks, and dessert.

Then Evelyn added, "One steak well-done."

The waiter hesitated. "Are you certain?"

"Absolutely."

He nodded and left.

Steak was usually best medium-rare. Well-done was… unusual.

Evelyn explained, "My stomach’s been sensitive lately. I need it fully cooked."

"No problem. Your comfort matters most," Victoria assured her.

Just then, Victoria’s phone buzzed.

She checked the screen and grinned. "Hello? What’s up?"

Her voice was sweet, laced with familiarity.

Evelyn couldn’t hear the response, but Victoria replied, "I’m at lunch. What do you need?"
###Chapter 146

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden streaks across her blueprints. She tapped her pen against the desk, lost in thought. The Martin Group project was nearing completion, but something felt off.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel.

"Meeting at 2 PM. Edward wants to discuss the final adjustments."

Evelyn sighed. Edward Martin had been relentless lately, scrutinizing every detail. She knew it wasn’t just about the project—it was about control.

Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Gregory is here. He says it’s urgent."

Evelyn frowned. Gregory never dropped by unannounced. "Send him in."

Gregory strode in, his expression tense. "We have a problem. The city just rejected our permit for the waterfront expansion."

"What?" Evelyn shot up from her chair. "That was approved weeks ago!"

Gregory ran a hand through his hair. "Someone pulled strings. Rumor is, Summit Realty is behind it."

Sebastian Wilson. Of course.

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. "Call Jonathan Blake. I want answers."

Gregory hesitated. "There’s more. Isabella Davis is back in town."

The name sent a chill down Evelyn’s spine. Nathaniel’s ex. The woman who had once shattered his heart.

"Why now?" Evelyn whispered.

Gregory shrugged. "Vanessa booked her a high-profile event. Coincidence? I doubt it."

Evelyn’s phone buzzed again. Nathaniel.

"Change of plans. Meet me at the penthouse. Now."

Her pulse quickened. Something was wrong.

Nathaniel stood by the window, his silhouette rigid against the city skyline. The moment Evelyn stepped in, she felt the tension.

"What happened?" she asked.

He turned, his eyes dark. "Isabella reached out. She wants to meet."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. "And?"

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "She claims she has information about my father’s accident."

Evelyn froze. Richard Martin’s death had always been shrouded in mystery.

"You’re going to see her," she stated.

Nathaniel nodded. "Tonight. At the old pier."

Evelyn gripped his arm. "Don’t go alone."

He cupped her face, his thumb brushing her cheek. "I won’t. But I need to know the truth."

A knock interrupted them. Samuel Yates, Nathaniel’s secretary, entered.

"Sir, Edward is on his way. He’s… not happy."

Nathaniel’s expression hardened. "Perfect timing."

Evelyn squeezed his hand. "Whatever happens, we face it together."

But as the door closed behind Samuel, a gnawing fear settled in her chest.

Isabella’s return was no coincidence.

And the truth? It might destroy everything.

Victoria's expression remained unreadable as she spoke into her phone. "Later? Perhaps we'll browse the boutiques later. I've been eyeing a few exquisite pieces from Tiffany's, but my budget has been rather tight these days..."

Whatever response came through the line must have pleased her, because her lips curved into a satisfied smile. "Fine, I'll graciously accept your offer then. We'll discuss it later, alright?"

As she ended the call and set her phone down, the smile lingered on her lips. Then, turning to Evelyn, she finally broached the subject she had been meaning to discuss. "Evelyn," she began softly, "are you settling in well at your new place?"

Evelyn met her gaze. It had been days since she moved out, and she knew it was impossible for the Martins not to notice. Yet neither Edward nor Victoria had directly questioned her, so she hadn't brought it up herself.

Now, faced with Victoria's gentle inquiry, a flicker of uncertainty passed through her.

She bit her lower lip lightly before asking, "Victoria… do you and Edward resent me for leaving?"

"Of course not. Why would you think that? Have I ever been harsh with you?" Victoria's voice was warm, her smile reassuring.

Evelyn shook her head. "No. You've always been the kindest to me."

"You'd dare say that in front of Edward?" Victoria teased.

Evelyn stuck out her tongue playfully. "The place I'm in now is smaller, and I have to manage everything myself, but it's not so bad. I lived alone during university—I'm used to it."

Victoria nodded thoughtfully. "Did Nathaniel do something to upset you? Cross a line?"

"No," Evelyn replied, pressing her lips together briefly before continuing, "I just thought we both needed space."

"Just space?"

Evelyn hesitated, her brows knitting slightly as she glanced at Victoria.

Victoria held her gaze, concern evident in her eyes. "Evelyn, tell me honestly—do you truly not want to be with Nathaniel anymore? Do you want a divorce?"

Evelyn exhaled slowly, her voice quiet but firm. "Yes. I think it's best if we part ways. He doesn’t love me. His heart belongs to someone else. And if we continue like this, any child we might have… they wouldn’t be happy either."

She had nearly forgotten what it felt like to yearn for a family, but the Martins had given her a glimpse—harmonious parents, a doting grandfather.

The only thing missing was Nathaniel’s love.

Perhaps that was simply fate. Not everything could be perfect.

"Evelyn," Victoria pressed gently, "is it really just because he doesn’t love you that you want this divorce?"

"Not entirely. Maybe… I just think separation is for the best."

Victoria leaned in slightly, her voice softening further. "Do you love him?"

Evelyn froze, her lips parting slightly before pressing together again. Her fingers tightened around her napkin.

She couldn’t bring herself to admit it aloud—but she couldn’t lie either.

Before she could answer, the waiter arrived with their food, providing a timely distraction.

The conversation shifted, and Victoria didn’t press further. Evelyn wasn’t sure if she had let it go or simply chosen not to push.

After the meal, Evelyn excused herself to the restroom—and discreetly settled the bill. Victoria frowned when she realized. "You shouldn’t have paid!"

"Why not? Didn’t you say we’re both women? Equals, right?"

Victoria sighed but smiled. "If you insist, I won’t argue."

They strolled to a nearby luxury mall, Victoria intent on picking out a few suits for Richard. Side by side, they could have been mistaken for mother and daughter.

Then, as they stepped into a high-end boutique, Evelyn froze.

A familiar figure stood just ahead.
###Chapter 147

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Pineview Villa, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. Evelyn stretched lazily in bed, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

She sighed, running a hand through her tousled hair. The weight of last night's argument still lingered in the air, unspoken but heavy. Nathaniel had been distant lately, ever since Isabella's unexpected return to the city.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory: "Meeting at 10. Don’t be late."

Evelyn groaned. She’d almost forgotten about the client presentation today. Throwing off the covers, she padded to the ensuite bathroom, the cool tiles soothing against her bare feet.

The shower did little to wash away her unease. As she towel-dried her hair, her gaze drifted to the framed photo on the dresser—her and Nathaniel on their honeymoon in Santorini, his arms wrapped around her waist, both of them laughing under the Mediterranean sun.

A sharp knock at the door startled her.

"Ma'am?" Alfred's voice filtered through. "Your car is ready."

"Thank you, Alfred. I’ll be down in five."

She dressed quickly, opting for a tailored navy pantsuit—professional yet elegant. As she fastened her pearl earrings, her phone buzzed again. This time, it was Caroline:

"Heard about Isabella’s charity gala tonight. You’re still coming, right?"

Evelyn’s fingers hovered over the screen. She hadn’t discussed it with Nathaniel. Would he even want to go?

Swallowing hard, she typed back: "Of course. See you there."

Downstairs, the scent of freshly brewed coffee and cinnamon rolls greeted her. Rosalind, their new chef, had outdone herself again.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin," Rosalind chirped, setting a plate before her. "You look lovely today."

"Thank you," Evelyn murmured, though her appetite had vanished. She picked at the pastry, her mind racing.

The drive to the office was quiet. Too quiet. Evelyn stared out the window, watching the city blur past. Was Nathaniel avoiding her? Or was she just being paranoid?

Her phone buzzed a third time. A notification from The Daily Chronicle:

"Isabella Davis Returns: A Star’s Comeback and the Rumors Swirling Around Martin Group’s Heir."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. She swiped the notification away, but the damage was done.

By the time she reached the office, her hands were clammy. Gabrielle, her assistant, took one look at her and frowned.

"Everything okay?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Just tired. Is the presentation ready?"

Gabrielle nodded. "All set. Gregory’s already in the conference room."

The meeting passed in a haze. Evelyn delivered her pitch flawlessly—years of practice made it second nature—but her mind was elsewhere.

Afterward, Gregory pulled her aside. "You were off today. What’s going on?"

She hesitated. "It’s nothing. Just... personal stuff."

He studied her for a moment, then sighed. "If you need to talk..."

"I know. Thanks."

Back at her desk, Evelyn stared at her computer screen, the words blurring together. She needed to focus. Needed to—

Her phone rang. Nathaniel’s name flashed across the screen.

Her heart leapt. "Hello?"

"Evelyn." His voice was strained. "We need to talk."

The line went dead before she could respond.

A cold dread settled in her chest. Whatever this was, it couldn’t be good.

And just like that, the fragile peace she’d been clinging to shattered.

The boutique was bathed in soft golden light when Evelyn spotted them—Margaret and Sophia. Dressed in an elegant silk dress that whispered of old money, Sophia offered a practiced smile. "Good afternoon, Mrs. Victoria Martin."

Her gaze flickered past Evelyn without acknowledgment before she leaned closer to Margaret, murmuring, "Mother, Mrs. Victoria Martin and Evelyn are here."

Margaret turned, her smile polished but hollow. "What a pleasant surprise. It’s been too long."

"Indeed. The city feels smaller these days," Victoria replied, her tone cordial yet cool.

After the obligatory exchange, Margaret’s voice sharpened. "Evelyn, where are your manners? Have you forgotten how to greet your own mother?"

Evelyn exhaled slowly, steadying herself. "Mother—"

Victoria smoothly cut in. "Margaret, don’t be too hard on her. I practically dragged Evelyn away from work today. Had I known you and Sophia were shopping, I’d have insisted she join you instead."

Margaret waved a dismissive hand. "Nonsense. She’s fortunate to spend time with you. After all, she’s Nathaniel’s wife now. It’s only right."

A knowing smirk curved Victoria’s lips. "You’re overthinking it. Honestly, sometimes I feel more like her mother than you do. Evelyn is extraordinary. Nathaniel marrying her was the best thing to happen to our family. We adore her as if she were our own."

The warmth in Victoria’s voice was unmistakable, a stark contrast to Margaret’s stiff demeanor. The unspoken comparison hung in the air like a slap.

Margaret’s jaw tightened, but she forced a smile. "Spoiling her will only make her ungrateful."

"Daughters should be spoiled," Victoria countered breezily, leaving no room for argument.

Sophia, ever the mediator, chimed in. "Mother, shouldn’t we be glad Mrs. Martin cares for Evelyn so deeply? More love is always a blessing, isn’t it?"

Margaret relented, though her smile didn’t reach her eyes. She turned to Evelyn. "Just remember—no matter how much Victoria dotes on you, you’re still a wife first. Respect and humility are paramount."

Evelyn’s fingers twitched at her side. She met Sophia’s gaze across the room, their silent standoff devoid of warmth.

Before Evelyn could respond, Victoria squeezed her hand reassuringly. "Margaret, you worry too much. Evelyn treats me with nothing but kindness. She even insisted on treating me to lunch earlier. We’re the lucky ones to have her."

Margaret paled, her retort dying on her lips as a familiar baritone voice cut through the tension.

"What’s going on here?"

Evelyn stiffened. Before she could turn, Nathaniel was beside her, his cedarwood scent enveloping her like a shield.

Sophia’s smile turned saccharine. "Nathaniel, what a lovely coincidence."

He gave her a curt nod before acknowledging Margaret with equal indifference.

Margaret, however, brightened unnaturally. "Nathaniel! How wonderful to see you!"

Nathaniel remained impassive, offering no reply.

Victoria arched a brow. "Sophia, dear, mind your smiles. He’s your sister’s husband. Boundaries matter."



###Chapter 148

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, she felt the weight of countless eyes on her. The air was thick with tension, the kind that made her fingers curl instinctively into her palms. She had known this day would come—the day she would finally meet Nathaniel’s family properly, not as an outsider, but as his wife.

At her side, Nathaniel’s grip on her hand tightened, his warmth a silent reassurance. “Relax,” he murmured, his voice low enough for only her to hear. “They’ll love you.”

Evelyn wasn’t so sure.

The Martins were a dynasty, their influence stretching far beyond the glittering chandeliers and marble floors of their ancestral home. And she? She was just Evelyn Mitchell, an architect with a modest firm and a past that didn’t quite fit into their polished world.

“Ah, there you are.” Edward Martin, Nathaniel’s grandfather, approached with measured steps, his sharp gaze assessing her from head to toe.

Evelyn straightened her shoulders, forcing a polite smile. “Mr. Martin, it’s an honor.”

Edward’s lips twitched, though whether in amusement or disapproval, she couldn’t tell. “We’ll see about that.”

Before she could respond, Victoria Martin swept forward, her elegant gown whispering against the floor. “Evelyn, darling,” she said, her tone smooth as silk. “We’ve heard so much about you.”

Evelyn caught the subtle edge beneath the sweetness. She had dealt with enough high-society women to recognize a veiled challenge when she heard one.

“All good things, I hope,” she replied lightly.

Victoria’s smile didn’t reach her eyes. “Of course.”

Nathaniel’s father, Richard, remained silent, his expression unreadable as he studied her. It was clear where Nathaniel got his piercing stare.

Then, from the corner of the room, a familiar laugh rang out—one that sent a chill down Evelyn’s spine.

Isabella Davis.

Nathaniel’s ex.

Dressed in a sleek black gown that hugged every curve, Isabella sauntered over, her crimson lips curved in a smirk. “Evelyn,” she purred. “How… unexpected to see you here.”

Evelyn’s pulse quickened, but she refused to let her discomfort show. “Isabella. I didn’t realize you’d be joining us.”

“Oh, I wouldn’t miss this for the world.” Isabella’s gaze flicked to Nathaniel, lingering just a second too long. “After all, family gatherings are always so… enlightening.”

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. “Isabella, this isn’t the time.”

She laughed, the sound like shattering glass. “Isn’t it?”

Evelyn felt the tension coil tighter, the room’s atmosphere shifting dangerously. She had known this wouldn’t be easy, but she hadn’t expected an ambush.

Then, from the doorway, a new voice cut through the tension.

“Well, isn’t this a delightful reunion?”

Everyone turned as Gregory Wilson, Evelyn’s business partner, strode in, his usual easy grin in place.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. “Gregory? What are you doing here?”

He winked. “Crashing the party, obviously.”

For the first time that evening, Evelyn felt a genuine smile tug at her lips.

But the relief was short-lived.

Because as Gregory stepped aside, another figure emerged—one that made Evelyn’s blood run cold.

Sebastian Wilson.

The man who had nearly destroyed her career.

His smirk was slow, deliberate. “Long time no see, Evelyn.”

The room seemed to tilt.

Nathaniel’s grip on her hand turned almost painful. “What the hell is he doing here?”

Sebastian spread his hands. “Just paying my respects to the happy couple.” His gaze locked onto Evelyn’s. “And offering a little… congratulations.”

Evelyn’s breath caught.

Because she knew—whatever game Sebastian was playing, it wasn’t over.

And this time, the stakes were higher than ever.

Evelyn stood frozen for a moment before nodding slowly. "Mrs. Victoria Martin, you're absolutely right."

"See how understanding Evelyn is," Victoria remarked, her tone polite but noticeably cooler than when she spoke to Sophia.

Nathaniel didn’t argue with his mother. Instead, he murmured, "Didn’t you have shopping to do?"

"Oh, right. My apologies—we should get going," Victoria said, taking Evelyn’s hand and leading her out of the boutique.

Once outside, she turned to Evelyn with an apologetic smile. "Darling, I didn’t mean to keep this from you. I just wanted Nathaniel to splurge a little today and treat us to something nice. Please don’t be upset with me."

Evelyn thought, With you phrasing it like that, how could I possibly stay angry?

"What would you like to buy?" she asked instead.

"Let’s browse first," Victoria replied, gesturing toward an upscale jewelry store nearby.

Victoria was renowned in elite circles as a connoisseur of fine jewelry, her collection boasting rare and exclusive pieces.

The moment they stepped inside, the staff recognized them immediately—especially Victoria, who was a distinguished VIP client.

"Mrs. Victoria Martin, we’ve reserved the jewelry set you inquired about. Would you like to see it now?" a sales associate greeted warmly.

Victoria nodded, and the three were escorted to the private VIP lounge.

The associate carefully unboxed the reserved item—a breathtaking diamond and emerald set that sparkled under the soft lighting.

Victoria’s eyes gleamed with approval. "I’ll take this set." Then she added, "Is my bracelet ready from maintenance?"

"It’s already been packaged for you. Shall we open it for inspection?" The associate swiftly produced another velvet box, revealing an exquisite emerald bracelet.

Victoria’s gaze shifted pointedly to Nathaniel. "I want this."

Nathaniel didn’t even blink. Then Victoria turned back to the associate. "What about the other bracelet I requested?"

The associate retrieved an ornate wooden box, lifting the lid to reveal an imperial green emerald bracelet of unparalleled clarity.

The gemstone’s icy translucence was mesmerizing, its rich hue intensified against the black velvet lining.

Handling it with reverence, the associate said, "This bracelet is exceptionally rare. Our master jewelers have never encountered emeralds of this quality before."

Victoria smiled enigmatically. After arranging payment for the jewelry set, she turned to Evelyn. "Evelyn, do you like this bracelet?"

Evelyn had been admiring it since the moment the box opened. It was, without question, a masterpiece. "It’s stunning," she admitted.

"If it’s stunning and you love it, then it’s yours," Victoria declared.

"Mine?" Evelyn’s eyes widened. "Victoria, I couldn’t possibly—this should stay with you as an heirloom."

"It is an heirloom. My mother gave it to me as a wedding gift. Now, I’m passing it to you," Victoria said, handing the bracelet to Nathaniel. "Nathaniel, help Evelyn put it on."

Nathaniel took it, then extended his other hand toward Evelyn, waiting for hers.

But Evelyn hesitated. "Victoria, this doesn’t feel right. Something so precious should remain with you—or your daughter."

"Precious things are meant to be passed down. Don’t overthink it, darling. Truthfully, I should’ve given it to you sooner, but it was with Nathaniel’s sister overseas. She only just returned it to me," Victoria explained.

Evelyn knew Nathaniel had a sister who lived abroad, though they’d never met.

Still, she resisted. "Victoria, your daughter should have it. It’s too significant for me to accept."

"Evelyn," Victoria said firmly, "if you truly see me as your mother-in-law, then take it."

Oh no, emotional leverage, Evelyn thought.

Victoria turned to Nathaniel. "Don’t you think Evelyn should have this?"
###Chapter 149

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew over the blueprints as she made last-minute adjustments to the resort project. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the crisp scent of tracing paper.

A soft knock interrupted her concentration. "Come in," she called without looking up.

Gabrielle, her assistant, stepped inside with a tablet in hand. "Ms. Mitchell, Mr. Wilson is here to see you. He says it's urgent."

Evelyn's pencil paused mid-stroke. Gregory never visited unannounced. "Send him in."

Gregory entered with uncharacteristic haste, his usually impeccable suit slightly rumpled. "We have a problem," he said, dropping a folder on her desk. "Summit Realty just filed an injunction against our waterfront development."

"What?" Evelyn snatched the documents, scanning the legal jargon rapidly. Her stomach twisted. "This can't be right. We cleared all the zoning approvals months ago."

"Sebastian Wilson is claiming historical preservation rights," Gregory explained, running a hand through his hair. "He's got the mayor's office backing him."

Evelyn's phone buzzed. Nathaniel's name flashed on the screen. She answered immediately. "Did you hear—"

"I just got off the phone with our legal team," Nathaniel's voice was tight with controlled anger. "Meet me at Martin Group headquarters in thirty minutes. We're declaring war."

The line went dead. Evelyn exchanged a look with Gregory. Neither needed to voice what they both knew—this wasn't just business. Sebastian had crossed a line, and Nathaniel Martin never backed down from a fight.

As Evelyn gathered her things, her gaze fell on the framed photo on her desk—her and Nathaniel laughing at their wedding reception. She touched the glass lightly. Whatever storm was coming, they'd face it together.

The elevator doors slid open to reveal Nathaniel waiting in the lobby, his sharp navy suit doing little to soften his predatory stance. When their eyes met, Evelyn saw the same fierce determination mirrored in his gaze that burned in her chest.

"Ready?" he asked, offering his arm.

Evelyn took it without hesitation. "Always."

Nathaniel narrowed his eyes slightly, his expression softening as he gazed at Evelyn. His voice was low, barely above a whisper. "If that's what you believe."

"See? Nathaniel agrees. Evelyn, just accept it, won't you?" Victoria beamed, her eyes crinkling at the corners.

Evelyn hesitated, her fingers brushing against the hem of Nathaniel's sleeve. She leaned in slightly, her voice a quiet plea. "Nathaniel, please… tell your mother I really shouldn’t take this."

They were in the middle of a divorce, after all. Accepting such a gift would only complicate things further.

But Nathaniel’s grip tightened around her wrist, his touch firm yet gentle. "If Mom wants you to have it, then take it. She has plenty more where that came from."

Before Evelyn could protest, he slid the bracelet onto her slender wrist. The delicate gold links contrasted sharply with her cool, understated elegance, creating a striking harmony between classic sophistication and modern simplicity.

Victoria clapped her hands together in delight. "Evelyn, now that you’ve accepted my gift, I’m afraid I must impose on you and your husband for a favor."

She emphasized the word husband with a playful smirk, making Evelyn’s cheeks flush. Nathaniel, fully aware of the tension between them, merely smirked in response, playing along.

Evelyn shot him a questioning glance, but his expression gave nothing away.

Just then, Victoria cleared her throat. "Oh dear, I just remembered—I have plans with an old friend. Nathaniel, hand me your keys. I’ll take your car. Evelyn, you can drive him home later. And don’t forget to settle the bill!"

Without waiting for a response, she swept out of the room, leaving Evelyn gaping after her.

Evelyn made to follow, but Nathaniel caught her wrist. "Where do you think you’re going?"

"I—"

"Evelyn," he murmured, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Do you truly despise being near me that much? Have I made you so uncomfortable?"

His piercing gaze bore into hers, stirring something deep and unnameable within her.

She pressed her lips together, refusing to answer.

Nathaniel’s grip tightened imperceptibly. "Answer me, Evelyn. Do you really hate seeing me this much?"

A beat of silence passed before she met his eyes. "Nathaniel, you know exactly where we stand. Yet you still insisted I take this bracelet. You’re making me feel guilty—like I’m betraying Victoria’s kindness."

"So you think I’m forcing you?" His voice turned icy. "It’s just a bracelet. If you don’t want it, then don’t take it. Why make it so complicated?"

"Do you honestly believe this is just about a bracelet?"

The unspoken weight between them was suffocating. The bracelet wasn’t just a gift—it was a symbol, a reminder of everything they were losing.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her eyes flashing with quiet defiance. Nathaniel’s jaw tightened, his expression hardening. "If you don’t want it, give it back to Mom. I doubt she’d force you to keep it the way you’re accusing me of doing."

With that, he turned on his heel and strode away.

Evelyn watched him go, her chest aching with an inexplicable heaviness. He hadn’t even let her drive him home. Their relationship had frozen over once again.

Was I wrong? she wondered, staring at the bracelet.

Nathaniel had said she could return it anytime, but how could she face Victoria after this?

Meanwhile, whispers of Evelyn’s divorce petition had spread. Isabella had caught wind of it, her lips curling in satisfaction.

But beneath her triumph, doubt lingered. Is Evelyn really ready to let go… or is this just another game?

Her delicate features darkened as she murmured to herself, "Well, now that the idea’s out there… I might as well make sure it sticks."



###Chapter 150

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. Evelyn stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work, as usual.

She sighed, rolling onto her back to stare at the intricate patterns on the ceiling. Last night’s argument still lingered in her mind—another disagreement about the upcoming gala and Isabella’s sudden reappearance in their lives.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory: "Emergency meeting at the office. We need you here ASAP."

Evelyn groaned. She had hoped for a quiet morning, maybe even a late breakfast with Nathaniel. But duty called.

The architecture firm was in chaos when she arrived. Gabrielle, her assistant, rushed toward her, clutching a stack of blueprints.

“Thank goodness you’re here,” Gabrielle said, breathless. “Summit Realty just pulled out of the Riverside project. They’re citing ‘creative differences.’”

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. That project was their biggest contract this year. “Where’s Gregory?”

“In his office, trying to salvage what he can.”

She marched straight to Gregory’s door and pushed it open without knocking. He was on the phone, his expression grim. When he saw her, he quickly ended the call.

“Sebastian Wilson is playing games,” Gregory said, tossing his phone onto the desk. “He wants us to redesign the entire layout—again—or he walks.”

Evelyn clenched her fists. “He can’t just change the terms mid-project. We have a contract.”

Gregory rubbed his temples. “He’s claiming we breached it first by not meeting his ‘vision.’”

She scoffed. “His ‘vision’ changes every other week.”

Gabrielle knocked lightly before stepping in. “Evelyn, Nathaniel’s secretary just called. He needs to speak with you urgently.”

Evelyn frowned. Nathaniel never contacted her during work hours unless it was important. “I’ll call him back.”

Gabrielle hesitated. “He said it’s about Isabella.”

The air in the room thickened. Gregory gave her a knowing look. “Go. Handle that first.”

Evelyn’s pulse quickened as she dialed Nathaniel’s number. What now?

Nathaniel’s voice was tense when he answered. “Evelyn, we have a problem.”

She braced herself. “What did Isabella do?”

“She gave an interview,” he said tightly. “She’s claiming we’re still involved.”

Evelyn’s grip on the phone tightened. “What?”

“It’s all over the media. I’m already dealing with the fallout, but I wanted you to hear it from me first.”

She closed her eyes, exhaling slowly. Just when she thought things couldn’t get worse.

“I’ll handle it,” Nathaniel said firmly. “But Evelyn… this might get ugly.”

She opened her eyes, her resolve hardening. “Then we’ll face it together.”

But as she hung up, a chilling thought crossed her mind—was Isabella just stirring trouble, or was there something more sinister at play?

And why now?

The game had changed. And Evelyn wasn’t about to back down.

Isabella seized the opportunity to visit her therapist as an excuse to intercept Nathaniel at the Martin Group headquarters. After finally catching up with him, she slipped into his car without hesitation.

Nathaniel remained impassive, his expression unreadable as he regarded her actions with detached indifference.

Biting her lower lip lightly, Isabella ventured, "Nathaniel, you seem upset. Did I do something to bother you?"

His cold gaze flickered toward her, sending a shiver down her spine.

Summoning her courage, she pressed on, "I didn’t mean to intrude. I just wanted to share what my therapist said. He assured me my condition isn’t permanent—with consistent treatment, I’ll recover."

"Fine." His voice was rough, barely above a whisper.

The slight acknowledgment softened her expression, and she smiled tentatively. "Nathaniel, what’s really bothering you? Is it because Evelyn wants a divorce?"

His brows knitted together sharply. "Who told you that?"

The dangerous edge in his tone made her falter. She hurried to explain, "I—I just overheard it somewhere. I don’t know if it’s true."

The frost in his demeanor didn’t thaw.

Isabella hesitated before pressing further. "Why is Evelyn so determined to leave you?"

"I don’t know." His disinterest was palpable. "That’s enough, Isabella. If you’re done, get out. I’m tired."

Her breath hitched. Is he dismissing me?

A pang of hurt twisted inside her, but she maintained her composure. "Nathaniel, if you’ve fallen for her, then of course this would upset you. But torturing yourself won’t change her mind. A woman only leaves this decisively when she’s found someone else. Otherwise, why wait until now?"

"Are you finished?" His voice was glacial, his piercing stare a silent warning.

She swallowed hard. "I’m just worried about you."

But Nathaniel had already closed his eyes, shutting her out completely. Clenching her jaw, Isabella had no choice but to push the car door open and step out.

The moment she did, the car sped away, leaving her standing there, seething. This is all Evelyn’s fault.

Inside the car, Nathaniel leaned back, eyes shut, his silence oppressive. Samuel, his driver, stole glances through the rearview mirror before finally speaking. "Mr. Martin, shall I take you straight to Pineview Villa?"

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. Without opening his eyes, he commanded, "Pull over. I’ll drive myself. You’re dismissed."

Samuel blinked in surprise but complied immediately. "Of course, sir."

He pulled to the side of the road and stepped out, opening the rear door. Nathaniel slid into the driver’s seat without another word.

Gripping the steering wheel, he stared ahead, his expression dark and unreadable. The weight of his thoughts pressed heavily on him, his brows drawn together in a deep furrow.

Minutes—or perhaps hours—later, he finally snapped out of his daze, only to realize where his subconscious had led him.

###Chapter 151

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. Evelyn stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the cool silk sheets. Beside her, Nathaniel was already awake, his piercing blue eyes studying her with that familiar intensity.

"You're staring," she murmured, a playful smile tugging at her lips.

"I can't help it," he admitted, his voice rough with sleep. "Not when you look like this."

Evelyn rolled her eyes but couldn't suppress the warmth spreading through her chest. Three years of marriage, and he still had the power to make her heart race with just a glance.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand, interrupting the moment. She reached for it, frowning at the notification.

"What is it?" Nathaniel asked, sensing the shift in her mood.

"Gregory," she sighed. "He wants to meet. Says it's urgent."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. Gregory Wilson, her business partner, had been acting strangely lately—more secretive, more distant. Evelyn had brushed it off as stress from their latest project, but something about this felt different.

"Want me to come with you?" Nathaniel offered, already shifting to get out of bed.

Evelyn shook her head. "No, I should handle this alone. Besides, you have that meeting with Edward today."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. His grandfather had been relentless lately, pushing him to take on more responsibilities within Martin Group. The weight of legacy was a constant shadow over them both.

"Fine," he conceded, pressing a kiss to her temple. "But call me if anything feels off."

Evelyn nodded, already mentally preparing for the conversation ahead.

The café was bustling when she arrived, the scent of freshly brewed coffee mingling with the chatter of patrons. Gregory sat in their usual corner booth, his fingers drumming restlessly against the table.

"You look like you haven't slept," Evelyn remarked as she slid into the seat across from him.

Gregory ran a hand through his disheveled hair. "Because I haven’t." He leaned forward, lowering his voice. "Evelyn, we have a problem. A big one."

Her stomach twisted. "What kind of problem?"

He hesitated, then pulled out a folder from his briefcase. Inside were blueprints—their latest project, the waterfront development they’d poured months into. Except someone had altered the designs. Significantly.

Evelyn's breath hitched. "This isn't our work."

Gregory's expression was grim. "No. And if these get submitted to the city council, we're looking at massive legal repercussions. Not to mention our reputation—"

"Who did this?" she demanded, her fingers tightening around the papers.

Gregory's gaze flickered away. "That's the thing… I think it's an inside job."

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

Because if Gregory was right, then someone in their own company was trying to sabotage them. And she had no idea who to trust.

Outside Evelyn's office building, Nathaniel sat in his sleek black car, his fingers drumming impatiently against the steering wheel as he watched the entrance. His sharp gaze caught movement—Evelyn stepping out, her face alight with a rare, carefree smile as she chatted animatedly with the man beside her.

Nathaniel's grip tightened. He didn’t need to hear their conversation to recognize the warmth in her expression—something she hadn’t shown him in months.

His phone was in his hand before he realized it, dialing her number with practiced ease.

Across the street, Evelyn paused mid-laugh, pulling her phone from her purse. The smile faded as she answered, her voice cool. "Hello?"

"Where are you?" Nathaniel's tone was deceptively calm.

"Just left work. Gregory and I are grabbing dinner." Her reply was clipped, guarded.

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched. "Gregory? So now he's just 'Gregory'?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Nathaniel, don’t do this."

"Do what? Ask why my wife is suddenly having dinner with another man?" His voice dropped dangerously. "Or should I ask if this is why you’ve been so eager to push for a divorce?"

Evelyn’s spine stiffened. She glanced around, her eyes landing on Nathaniel’s car parked across the street. Of course he was here. Watching.

She lowered her voice. "He’s my business partner. We’re discussing a project. That’s all."

"Is that what you’re calling it now?" Nathaniel’s laugh was humorless. "Funny how you never mentioned these cozy dinners before."

Evelyn’s patience snapped. "Because I knew you’d react like this! You don’t trust me, Nathaniel. Not with my work, not with my choices—not with anything."

Beside her, Gregory shifted uncomfortably, sensing the tension. "Evelyn," he murmured, "should we reschedule?"

She shook her head, then met Nathaniel’s gaze through the windshield, her voice steady. "No. We’re going to dinner. And no, Nathaniel, it’s not what you’re thinking. But at this point, I don’t care if you believe me."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "So that’s it? You’d rather throw away our marriage than admit the truth?"

Evelyn’s fingers curled into fists. "The truth is, we don’t have a marriage left to throw away. Not when you see betrayal in every conversation I have with another man."

Gregory cleared his throat. "Evelyn, the reservation—"

"I know." She cut him off, then spoke into the phone one last time. "Goodbye, Nathaniel."

The line went dead.

Nathaniel watched as Evelyn turned away, Gregory’s hand hovering near her back as they walked toward his car. A muscle ticked in Nathaniel’s jaw.

This wasn’t over.



###Chapter 152

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew over the blueprints, making precise adjustments with her mechanical pencil. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint aroma of ink from the printer.

Gabrielle knocked lightly before entering, balancing a stack of files in one arm. "The revised contracts from Summit Realty just arrived," she announced, placing them carefully on the edge of Evelyn's desk. "Sebastian Wilson's assistant called—they need your signature by noon."

Evelyn sighed, rubbing her temples. "Of course they do." She reached for her coffee cup, only to find it empty. "Could you—"

"Already on it," Gabrielle interrupted with a knowing smile, grabbing the mug. "Double shot latte, no sugar. And I took the liberty of rescheduling your three o'clock with the zoning committee to tomorrow."

"You're an angel," Evelyn murmured, turning back to her designs. The new waterfront development project had been consuming her every waking hour since Nathaniel had entrusted her with it. The weight of responsibility pressed against her chest, but she welcomed the challenge.

Her phone buzzed with a text from Nathaniel: Dinner at Le Ciel tonight. 8pm. Wear the blue dress. She bit her lip to suppress a smile. Even after all this time, his commanding texts still sent a thrill through her.

The office door burst open before she could reply. Gregory stormed in, his usually impeccable tie loosened. "We have a problem," he announced, tossing a newspaper onto her desk.

Evelyn's stomach dropped as she read the headline: Martin Group Heir's Secret Affair with Former Flame Revealed. Below it was a grainy photo of Nathaniel and Isabella leaving a hotel together, taken just last night.

Her fingers trembled as she dialed Nathaniel's number. It went straight to voicemail. Again.

Gabrielle returned with the coffee, her eyes widening at the tension in the room. "Everything okay?"

Evelyn stood abruptly, knocking over her chair. "Cancel all my appointments," she said through gritted teeth, grabbing her purse. "I need to pay a visit to Martin Tower."

As she marched toward the elevator, her phone pinged with another message—this time from an unknown number. The attached photo showed Nathaniel and Isabella in what appeared to be a passionate embrace, timestamped just thirty minutes ago.

The elevator doors slid open to reveal Caroline, her cousin's face pale. "Evelyn, I just heard—"

"Not now," Evelyn cut her off, stepping inside. She pressed the lobby button with more force than necessary. As the doors closed, she caught a glimpse of her reflection—eyes blazing, jaw set. The perfect picture of a woman about to wage war.

The elevator descended, and with each passing floor, Evelyn's mind raced. She'd trusted Nathaniel completely. Given him everything. And now? Now she would get answers, even if she had to tear down Martin Tower brick by brick to get them.

The icy edge in Evelyn's voice made Nathaniel's jaw tighten. His fingers curled around the phone as he spoke with forced calm. "These aren't grounds for divorce, Evelyn. But if you insist on speaking to me like this, fine. I'll believe you—if you come to my car right now."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "You're still not listening, Nathaniel. This isn't about walking to your car. It's about trust—or the lack of it. Even if we patch things up today, what happens tomorrow?"

"So you'd rather have dinner with Gregory than talk to me?" His voice dropped dangerously low.

"I didn't know you were coming," she countered. "And I won't cancel on him last minute."

"Evelyn." His tone was glacial. "Are you trying to provoke me?"

"If this is all it takes to upset you, then I don't know what to say."

Just then, Gregory's car pulled up beside her. He rolled down the window, his gaze flickering past her to the black Mercedes idling nearby. "Evelyn, hop in."

She nodded, then glanced—almost involuntarily—at Nathaniel's car. He must have heard Gregory. With a quiet exhale, she said, "I'm leaving for dinner. If there's nothing else, I'll hang up."

Silence.

Evelyn frowned and ended the call.

Sliding into Gregory's passenger seat, she barely registered the way he accelerated past Nathaniel's car faster than necessary.

Gregory stole a glance at her. "Evelyn, did Nathaniel come here for something important?"

"No. Just another argument about the divorce he refuses to accept." Her voice was hollow as she stared out the window, her reflection blurred against the passing city lights.

Gregory's grip on the wheel tightened. He knew better than anyone how deeply Evelyn had loved Nathaniel. The fact that she was the one initiating the divorce now—it didn't make sense.

"So he's the one holding on?" he mused aloud.

Cautiously, he probed further. "Evelyn, why now? He's finally acknowledging your relationship publicly. Shouldn't that make you happy? What changed?"

She didn't answer immediately, turning his question over in her mind.

The truth was, Nathaniel's public acknowledgment had stunned her more than it pleased her. She'd never expected it, and when it happened, all she felt was a dull ache of disbelief.

Her lips pressed into a thin line. "Maybe I've gotten greedy. I want more than he's willing to give. And the one thing I need most? He refuses."

She still hadn't told Gregory about the pregnancy. She wasn't sure why—maybe she didn't want to drag him deeper into her mess.

From that day on, Nathaniel stopped reaching out.

Work, however, forced them into occasional proximity. Evelyn, Gregory, and their team sometimes dined at the upscale restaurants the Martin Group frequented for client meetings. More than once, they crossed paths with Nathaniel in the lobby or at the entrance.

But each time, Nathaniel walked past as if she were invisible—no glance, no acknowledgment.

Even Daniel and the others noticed the tension, though none dared to comment.

This strained dance continued until the morning Gregory called in a panic.

"Evelyn, we have a problem. The Martin Group just terminated our contract."

Her blood ran cold. "What? Why?"



###Chapter 153

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew over the blueprints, making precise adjustments with her mechanical pencil. The scent of freshly brewed coffee from Gabrielle's desk mingled with the crisp scent of tracing paper.

A sharp knock interrupted her concentration. "Come in," she called without looking up.

The door swung open to reveal Nathaniel, his tailored navy suit accentuating his broad shoulders. His usual composed expression was replaced by something darker—a storm brewing behind those piercing gray eyes. "We need to talk," he said, his voice dangerously calm.

Evelyn's pencil stilled. That tone never meant anything good. "About?"

He strode forward, dropping a glossy magazine onto her desk. The headline screamed in bold letters: Isabella Davis Returns: The Woman Who Almost Married Nathaniel Martin Spills All.

Her stomach dropped. The accompanying photo showed Isabella at some high-profile event, her crimson lips curved in a smirk that promised trouble. "When did this come out?" Evelyn asked, flipping through the pages with numb fingers.

"Just this morning." Nathaniel ran a hand through his hair, a rare sign of agitation. "She's giving an exclusive interview tonight on Celebrity Tonight."

Evelyn's pulse pounded in her ears. After all these years of silence, why now? Isabella had vanished from their lives after the failed engagement, only to resurface like a vengeful ghost. "What does she want?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "That's what I intend to find out." He pulled out his phone, scrolling through messages. "Samuel just informed me she's been in talks with Summit Realty."

Evelyn's head snapped up. "Sebastian Wilson's company? The one bidding against us for the waterfront project?" The pieces clicked together with chilling clarity. This wasn't just personal—it was professional sabotage.

His nod confirmed her fears. "She's playing both sides. Stirring up old scandals to undermine my reputation while secretly working with our biggest competitor."

A cold fury settled over Evelyn. She pushed back from her desk, the chair scraping loudly. "Then we fight fire with fire." She grabbed her tablet, pulling up files with swift movements. "I have the original contracts from when Isabella worked at Martin Group. There were... irregularities in her department's finances before she left."

Nathaniel's eyes gleamed with approval. "You kept those?"

"Always document everything," she said grimly. "Especially when someone leaves under suspicious circumstances."

His phone buzzed again. A muscle twitched in his cheek as he read the message. "It's worse than we thought. Vanessa just leaked to TMZ that Isabella has 'shocking revelations' about our marriage."

Evelyn's blood ran cold. There were things in their past—secrets—that could destroy everything they'd built. She met Nathaniel's gaze, seeing the same steely determination mirrored there. "We need to move fast."

He reached for her hand, his grip warm and reassuring despite the chaos. "Together," he said firmly.

Just then, Gabrielle burst in, her usually cheerful face pale. "Turn on Channel 7. Now."

Nathaniel grabbed the remote. The screen flickered to life, showing Isabella sitting primly on a talk show set, her smile razor-sharp. The ticker at the bottom read: Exclusive: Isabella Davis Claims Nathaniel Martin's Marriage Built on Lies.

Evelyn's vision tunneled. The war had just begun.

A project that had been running smoothly came to an abrupt stop—there had to be a reason behind it.

Gregory was frantic. "Mr. Carter just called me. He didn’t give any specifics, only that it was a decision from the top."

"From the top? Whose decision?" she wondered.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, her gaze turning icy. "I understand."

"Evelyn, is Nathaniel doing this to pressure you into reconsidering the divorce?" Gregory couldn’t hold back the question any longer.

Evelyn didn’t answer directly. Instead, she said, "Summit Realty must already know. Let’s see what they have to say first."

Gregory didn’t push further. He muttered, "Don’t worry, Evelyn. I’ll find out what’s really going on."

"Thank you."

After hanging up, she tossed her phone aside and finally got out of bed.

She pulled open the curtains, her expression unreadable. Outside, the sun was shining brightly, but her heart felt heavy with shadows.

She stood there for a long time, forcing herself to steady her restless thoughts.

Half an hour later, Evelyn left her apartment—but instead of heading to the office, she drove straight to the Martin Group headquarters.

When she arrived, she took the elevator up to the executive floor.

Samuel was the first to notice her. "Mrs. Martin."

"Mr. Yates, is Nathaniel available? I need to speak with him." Her tone was polite, but the frost in her eyes was unmistakable.

Samuel knew exactly why she was here. He answered carefully, "Mr. Martin is in his office, but he’s currently with a client. Would you like to—"

"It’s fine. I’ll wait." Without waiting for his response, she walked toward the lounge area.

Evelyn sat silently on the sofa, her posture rigid. Though she had declined any assistance, Samuel still brought her a glass of water.

Minutes ticked by. The office door remained shut, not a single sound escaping from inside.

Her lips pressed into a thin line. Though her expression was strained, she clung to the last threads of her composure.

Then, after what felt like an eternity, Samuel’s intercom buzzed.

Nathaniel’s voice came through, indifferent. "Bring me a coffee."

"Right away." Samuel glanced at Evelyn—she had heard it too, but she gave no reaction.

He quickly prepared the coffee and carried it into the office, leaving the door slightly ajar. Nathaniel’s cold gaze flickered toward him. "Is she still out there?"

"Yes," Samuel confirmed.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened, a faint smirk playing on his lips. "Let her wait."

In truth, Nathaniel had known the moment Evelyn stepped into the building. He had expected her to come—but he had no intention of making this easy for her.

Before Samuel could respond, the office door was pushed open.

Evelyn stood there, her narrowed eyes locked onto Nathaniel.

There was no client in sight—just him and Samuel. The supposed meeting had been nothing but an excuse. He simply hadn’t wanted to see her.

Her jaw tightened. After a sharp inhale, she demanded, "Nathaniel, what is the meaning of this?"

Samuel quickly lowered his head and slipped out of the room.

Nathaniel glanced at her, his smile cold and detached. "Should I know what you’re referring to?"

"Did you suspend the project?"

"Yes."

He didn’t bother hiding it. Setting down his pen, he leaned back in his chair and lit a cigarette, exhaling slowly.

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed. For a moment, she was too stunned to speak.

###Chapter 154

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, the weight of Nathaniel’s absence pressed heavily on her shoulders. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the marble floors, but the opulence did nothing to ease the storm brewing inside her.

She had spent the last few hours poring over blueprints in her office, trying to distract herself from the gnawing uncertainty. But now, standing in the heart of the Martin family’s domain, she couldn’t ignore the tension any longer.

"Evelyn," a familiar voice called. She turned to see Isabella Davis gliding toward her, her crimson dress swaying with each step. The sight of Nathaniel’s ex-lover sent a sharp pang through Evelyn’s chest.

"Isabella," Evelyn replied, forcing a polite smile. "I didn’t expect to see you here."

Isabella’s lips curved into a knowing smirk. "Oh, I’m always around when Nathaniel needs me."

The implication hung in the air, thick and suffocating. Evelyn clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms. She wouldn’t let Isabella get under her skin—not tonight.

Before she could respond, Samuel Yates, Nathaniel’s ever-efficient secretary, appeared at her side. "Mrs. Martin, Mr. Martin has requested your presence in the study."

Evelyn exhaled slowly. "Thank you, Samuel."

As she followed him down the corridor, her mind raced. What did Nathaniel want? Was it about the rumors swirling around Isabella’s sudden reappearance in his life? Or was it something else entirely?

The study door creaked open, revealing Nathaniel standing by the fireplace, his expression unreadable. The flickering flames cast shadows across his sharp features, making him look even more imposing than usual.

"You wanted to see me?" Evelyn asked, stepping inside.

Nathaniel turned to face her, his dark eyes piercing. "We need to talk."

The gravity in his voice sent a chill down her spine. Whatever he was about to say, she knew it would change everything.

And just like that, the storm inside her broke loose.

Evelyn had managed to steady her emotions while waiting outside, but Nathaniel's dismissive demeanor reignited her frustration. Clenching her fists, she forced herself to speak calmly. "Nathaniel, why are you doing this? This project isn't just about me. Summit Realty depends on it to sustain its employees this year. If you pull out now, your company will suffer losses too."

His expression remained unreadable, his voice chillingly detached. "There's no 'why.' I simply no longer find this venture worthwhile."

No longer worthwhile. The words echoed in her mind, sharp as knives.

She studied the man before her—so familiar yet impossibly distant. He stood mere feet away, yet an uncrossable chasm stretched between them.

Nathaniel continued, indifferent. "Your partners' struggles aren't my concern. We're divorcing, after all. As for Summit Realty—if it can't survive, it shouldn't. But the project won't die. The Martin Group will simply find new partners to complete it."

Evelyn's breath caught.

New partners? That would publicly humiliate both her and Summit Realty, branding them as failures. She could endure the personal blow, but her company didn’t deserve this.

Her patience snapped. "Mr. Martin, we’re halfway through this collaboration. If you’re sabotaging it because I filed for divorce, isn’t that turning personal grievances into professional retaliation? Just because I want out of this marriage, must you destroy me?"

The formal address—Mr. Martin—made his icy demeanor turn glacial.

"You’re imagining things," Nathaniel said, his gaze frigid. "I merely agree with one thing you said. Once divorce is decided, we should cut all ties."

That’s what this is about.

Evelyn stared at his striking features, now so cold they might as well have been carved from marble. She pressed her lips together briefly before responding, her voice steady. "You're right. Once we’re divorced, we should never cross paths again. So sign the papers, Nathaniel. Let’s set a date to finalize this."

Her composure only stoked the storm in his eyes.

Nathaniel’s gaze locked onto hers, sharp enough to pierce. "Even now, you won’t reconsider?"

A bitter laugh nearly escaped her. "What, is this all because I won’t back down? Your actions make it seem like you’re in love with me. But your heart was never truly mine. I don’t understand you—one moment, you act devoted, the next, utterly ruthless. This marriage is torture."

She exhaled, too weary to argue further. "Just tell me—when will you sign?"
###Chapter 155

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady and calm. She studied his face—the sharp line of his jaw, the faint scar near his temple from a childhood accident. Even in sleep, he exuded an air of quiet authority.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory.

"Evelyn, we need to talk. The Summit Realty deal is falling apart. Sebastian is making unreasonable demands."

She frowned. The Summit Realty project was supposed to be their biggest breakthrough yet. If it collapsed now, their firm’s reputation would take a hit.

Nathaniel’s arm tightened around her waist as he murmured, "What’s wrong?"

She hesitated. "Work trouble. Gregory says Sebastian is being difficult."

Nathaniel’s eyes snapped open, alert. "Sebastian Wilson?"

Evelyn nodded. "He’s pushing for last-minute changes. Again."

Nathaniel sat up, running a hand through his tousled hair. "I’ll handle it."

She placed a hand on his arm. "No. This is my project. I need to deal with it."

His gaze softened. "You don’t have to do everything alone, Evelyn."

She smiled faintly. "I know. But I want to."

Downstairs, Alfred had already prepared breakfast—fresh fruit, pastries, and coffee. Evelyn took a sip, savoring the rich flavor.

Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was Isabella.

"We need to talk. It’s urgent."

Evelyn’s grip on her cup tightened. Isabella had been nothing but trouble since she reappeared in Nathaniel’s life.

Alfred cleared his throat. "Madam, your car is ready."

She set her cup down. "Thank you, Alfred."

As she stepped outside, the crisp morning air filled her lungs. The city was waking up, the streets bustling with life.

But beneath the surface, tension simmered.

Sebastian’s demands. Isabella’s sudden urgency.

Something was coming.

And Evelyn had a feeling she wouldn’t like it.

Nathaniel's jaw was clenched tight, his piercing gaze radiating icy detachment.

His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper as he narrowed his eyes. "Leave. Now. Before I lose my patience with you."

Evelyn didn’t budge.

Her tone remained steady. "If you won’t reconsider our partnership, then at least sign the divorce papers I sent. Let me take them and go."

"Nathaniel, are you deliberately trying to provoke me?" His voice was rough with barely contained fury.

"You said you never wanted to see me again," she countered coolly. "Sign the papers, and I’ll vanish from your life. Isn’t that what you want?"

"Evelyn!" His voice cracked like a whip, thick with suppressed rage. Just her name, yet it carried the weight of a storm.

She met his glare impassively. "We’re getting divorced. I’m not asking for anything—just my freedom. And yet, you’re still not satisfied?"

"Get. Out." He pointed sharply at the door, his command leaving no room for argument.

Their eyes locked in a silent battle before Evelyn finally pressed her lips together. She knew pushing further would only ignite his temper. With one last lingering look, she turned and walked out.

The moment the door clicked shut behind her, a deafening crash erupted from inside—Nathaniel had swept everything off his desk in a fit of rage.

He yanked at his tie, his handsome face twisted in fury. The mere thought of Evelyn demanding his signature on those papers made his blood boil.

When Samuel cautiously stepped in and saw the wreckage, he hesitated. "Mr. Martin, Ms. Davis is here to see you. Should I—"

Nathaniel’s glacial stare cut him off mid-sentence, sending a chill down Samuel’s spine.

Swallowing hard, Samuel retreated. He approached Isabella, who waited outside, and murmured, "Ms. Davis, Mr. Martin is... unavailable at the moment. Would you like to reschedule?"

Isabella’s lips thinned as her gaze flickered toward Evelyn, who stood by the elevator, waiting. They hadn’t exchanged words earlier, but seeing Nathaniel claim to be "busy" now? She knew better.

She smoothed her expression. "If Nathaniel is occupied, I’ll come back another time. Let me know when he’s free."

Samuel nodded. "Of course, Ms. Davis."

Before leaving, Isabella cast a long, thoughtful glance at Nathaniel’s closed office door. Then, as she reached the elevator, she noticed Evelyn still standing there—ignoring her completely.

A sly smile curved Isabella’s lips. She lowered her voice to a taunting whisper. "Evelyn, did you upset Nathaniel? Or are you rushing this divorce because you’ve already moved on?"

Silence.

Undeterred, Isabella pressed on. "If you’ve found someone else, just admit it. Don’t let Nathaniel take the blame from his grandfather while you walk away scot-free."

Evelyn finally turned, her expression frosty. "Are you finished?"



###Chapter 156

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples as she reviewed the final blueprints for the Martin Group's new eco-resort. The project had consumed her every waking moment for weeks.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, straightening her posture.

Gabrielle, her assistant, stepped inside with a tablet in hand. "Evelyn, Mr. Wilson is here to see you. He says it's urgent."

Evelyn frowned. Gregory never dropped by unannounced unless something was wrong. "Send him in."

Gregory strode in moments later, his usual composed demeanor replaced by visible tension. "We have a problem," he said without preamble.

Evelyn's stomach tightened. "What is it?"

"The zoning permits for the eco-resort—they've been blocked."

"What?" She shot to her feet. "How? We submitted everything weeks ago. The city council approved the preliminary plans."

Gregory exhaled sharply. "Someone filed a last-minute objection, citing environmental concerns. The hearing's been pushed back indefinitely."

Evelyn's mind raced. This couldn’t be a coincidence—not when the project was so close to breaking ground. "Who filed the objection?"

Gregory hesitated. "Summit Realty."

Her blood ran cold. Sebastian Wilson’s company. The man had been a thorn in her side ever since she’d rejected his advances at an industry gala months ago.

"This is personal," she muttered, clenching her fists.

Gregory nodded grimly. "I think so too. But we can’t let him derail this project. Nathaniel’s counting on us."

Evelyn took a deep breath, forcing herself to think. "We need to act fast. Schedule a meeting with the city planner. And get me everything you can find on Summit’s recent projects—especially any violations or shortcuts they’ve taken."

Gregory’s lips curved into a knowing smile. "Already on it."

As he turned to leave, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel lit up the screen:

"Dinner tonight? We need to talk."

Her heart skipped. Something in his tone felt off. Was this about the permits? Or something else entirely?

She typed a quick reply. "Of course. 7 PM?"

The response came instantly. "Perfect. I’ll pick you up."

Evelyn set her phone down, her earlier determination mingling with unease. Whatever was coming, she’d face it head-on—just like she always did.

But first, she had a corporate saboteur to outmaneuver.

Evelyn's eyes blazed with a dangerous glint, the intensity of her gaze momentarily freezing Isabella in place.

Seizing the moment, Evelyn spoke with chilling precision. "Shouldn't you be overjoyed about my divorce proposal? Or is there something you're not admitting? Maybe you're not as desperate to marry him as you pretend to be. If that's the case, I might reconsider—but don't come crying to me later."

"You wouldn't dare!" Isabella's eyes widened, a flicker of excitement betraying her shock.

Evelyn smirked. "Test me, and you'll regret it. You saw for yourself—he's the one clinging to this marriage now. So tell me, do you honestly think you can compete with me?"

Isabella's face tightened, but she forced a composed expression. "What's there to boast about? Nathaniel refusing to divorce is just a scheme to get you pregnant. You think you're—"

"Ah!"

Isabella's scream shattered the quiet of the elevator lobby.

Before she could finish, Evelyn grabbed her collar and slammed her against the wall, her eyes icy with fury. "Say that again."

Isabella froze, too terrified to speak, barely daring to breathe.

Evelyn held her gaze, the air thick with tension.

Samuel, alerted by the commotion, rushed over, his eyes widening at the scene. He glanced at the open elevator doors and murmured, "Mrs. Martin, the elevator is ready. Should we leave now?"

Evelyn didn’t look away from Isabella, her voice like steel. "Isabella, don’t push me. Or that wall won’t be the only thing holding you up—it’ll be the balcony."

With that, she released Isabella’s collar, stepping back before turning to Samuel and entering the elevator.

Isabella didn’t follow. She stood rooted to the spot, struggling to steady her breathing.

Evelyn’s aggression had shaken her. For a split second, she’d genuinely feared for her life.

Biting her lip, Isabella turned to Samuel, her voice trembling with indignation. "Is Nathaniel still in meetings?"

"He’s occupied," Samuel replied neutrally.

Isabella nodded, then leaned closer, lowering her voice. "You know about their divorce plans, don’t you?"

Samuel hesitated briefly before responding, "Ms. Davis, Mr. Martin’s personal affairs are confidential. I can’t discuss them."

"Whether you’re allowed to interfere or not doesn’t matter. But you should know who’ll be by Nathaniel’s side after the divorce. Make sure he hears about today’s incident—from you. I won’t let this slide. And if you help me, I won’t forget it."

Samuel remained silent, his gaze dropping to avoid hers.

The tension lingered until Isabella’s phone buzzed, breaking the silence. She shot Samuel a meaningful look. "Samuel, you know who truly matters to Nathaniel."

Her words carried weight, but whether Samuel understood was unclear.

The elevator arrived just then, cutting off further conversation, and Isabella left without another word.

Moments later, Samuel entered Nathaniel’s office to report on his tasks. He hesitated before adding, "Mr. Martin, there was an altercation between Mrs. Martin and Ms. Davis earlier. It turned physical."

Nathaniel’s expression remained unreadable. "Physical?"
###Chapter 157

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Pineview Villa, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. Evelyn stood by the window, her fingers tracing the delicate rim of her coffee cup. The warmth seeped into her skin, but it did little to ease the tension coiling in her chest.

Nathaniel had left early—again.

She exhaled sharply, setting the cup down with more force than necessary. The porcelain clinked against the saucer, the sound sharp in the quiet room.

"He’s avoiding me."

The realization settled heavily in her mind. Ever since their argument about Isabella’s sudden reappearance, Nathaniel had been distant, burying himself in work. Meetings. Calls. Anything to keep from facing the unresolved tension between them.

Her phone buzzed on the counter. A message from Gregory.

"Evelyn, we need to finalize the blueprints for the Summit Realty project by noon. Sebastian is pushing for revisions."

She groaned, rubbing her temples. Another crisis to handle. Another distraction from the storm brewing in her personal life.

Just as she reached for her bag, the front door swung open. Alfred, their ever-composed butler, stepped inside, his expression unreadable.

"Madam, Mr. Martin has requested your presence at the office. He said it’s urgent."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Urgent?

"Did he say why?"

Alfred hesitated—just for a fraction of a second—but it was enough to set off alarms in her head.

"No, Madam. Only that you should come immediately."

Her fingers tightened around the strap of her bag. Whatever this was, it wasn’t good.

The Martin Group’s headquarters loomed ahead, its glass façade reflecting the midday sun like a polished blade. Evelyn strode through the lobby, her heels clicking against the marble in a steady, determined rhythm.

The elevator ride to the top floor felt endless.

When the doors slid open, Samuel Yates—Nathaniel’s ever-efficient secretary—was already waiting, his expression grim.

"Mrs. Martin," he greeted, his voice low. "He’s in the conference room."

She didn’t bother with pleasantries. "What’s going on, Samuel?"

He hesitated, then sighed. "It’s better if you see for yourself."

Her stomach twisted.

The moment she pushed open the conference room doors, the air thickened with tension. Nathaniel stood at the head of the table, his jaw set, his usually composed demeanor fraying at the edges.

And seated across from him—

Isabella.

Evelyn’s breath caught.

The woman smiled, slow and deliberate, as if she’d been waiting for this moment.

"Evelyn," she purred. "So lovely to see you again."

Nathaniel’s gaze snapped to Evelyn’s, his eyes dark with unspoken warning.

This wasn’t a coincidence.

Isabella was here for a reason.

And whatever game she was playing, Evelyn had just been dragged into it.

"Ms. Davis hurled some vicious insults, and Mrs. Martin lost her temper. She pinned Ms. Davis against the wall."

Though Nathaniel hadn’t witnessed the scene himself, he could easily reconstruct what had happened. After a year of marriage, he knew Evelyn wasn’t the type to provoke without cause.

"Is she hurt?"

Nathaniel’s voice was icy, detached.

Samuel hesitated before answering quietly, "No, sir. Mrs. Martin only gave Ms. Davis a warning..."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened, his tone turning frigid. "From today onward, I don’t want to hear another word about Evelyn."

Samuel stiffened in surprise.

But he nodded. "Understood, Mr. Martin."

Does this mean I no longer need to report anything regarding Mrs. Martin? Samuel wondered but chose not to press further, swiftly exiting the office.

Nathaniel’s decision sent shockwaves through Evelyn’s company. Tension hung thick in the air as employees fretted over the project’s future. Summit Realty soon learned that Nathaniel had severed ties because of Evelyn.

Sebastian Wilson arrived in person, desperation lacing his voice. "Mrs. Martin, can’t you and Mr. Martin resolve your personal matters privately? His decision has put us in an impossible position. Several contracts we were about to sign have fallen through. If this continues, we’ll be ruined."

Evelyn remained silent, her expression unreadable. Sebastian’s words struck a chord. In the ruthless world of business, the Martin Group’s influence was undeniable, and once momentum shifted, reversing it was nearly impossible.

Gregory frowned, casting a sympathetic glance at Evelyn before addressing Sebastian. "Mr. Wilson, we understand the gravity of the situation. But Evelyn just returned from the Martin Group. Nathaniel is being unreasonable. Mixing personal grievances with business is unprofessional."

"Mr. Wilson, that’s not what I meant. Married couples argue all the time, don’t they? If Mrs. Martin could just extend an olive branch, this whole mess could be smoothed over."

Gregory’s face hardened. "Mr. Wilson, if that’s your stance, then there’s nothing left to discuss. We have a contract. If you’re suffering losses, so are we."

Sebastian’s expression soured. "Are you refusing to even attempt reconciliation?"

"Mr. Wilson," Evelyn interjected firmly, meeting his gaze, "I apologize for any trouble my actions have caused your company. I’ll do everything in my power to rectify the situation."

With that, the argument reached an impasse.

After Sebastian left, Gregory turned to Evelyn, his expression grave. "Evelyn, what’s your plan? Are you considering speaking to Nathaniel?"

"Forget it. I’ll handle this myself."

"Evelyn."

"Please, Gregory. Let’s drop it."

Gregory exhaled sharply, frustration evident, while Evelyn retreated to her office.

News of the incident spread like wildfire through their social circles, sparking endless speculation about the rift between Nathaniel and Evelyn. Yet neither offered an explanation, leaving rumors to fester. Some whispered it was a calculated move by the couple to force Summit Realty out, leaving the company scrambling for solutions.

That evening, Evelyn drove to Martin Manor.

Edward, Victoria, and the others were midway through dinner when the sound of a car pulling up reached them. Victoria glanced up. "Is Nathaniel back?"

"Hmph. Coming home to flaunt his power by mistreating his wife?" Edward grumbled, his anger simmering.

He was well aware of Nathaniel’s recent decision.

Even now, he hesitated to reach out to Evelyn, disgusted by his grandson’s behavior.

When footsteps approached, Edward didn’t bother turning around, his voice sharp with disapproval. "You’ve returned? If I were as cold-hearted as you, I wouldn’t dare step foot in this house again. You might as well leave. This family has no need for you!"

###Chapter 158

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, her breath caught in her throat. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the marble floors, illuminating the sea of elegantly dressed guests. Among them stood Nathaniel, his tall frame commanding attention even in the crowded room.

She adjusted the strap of her emerald-green gown, her fingers trembling slightly. The last time she had seen him was at the office, where their argument had left a bitter taste in her mouth. Now, here they were, forced to play the perfect couple for his grandfather’s birthday celebration.

"Evelyn." His voice was low, smooth, and laced with something unreadable as he approached her.

"Nathaniel," she replied, forcing a polite smile. "The party looks magnificent."

His gaze flickered over her, lingering just a second too long on the delicate necklace resting against her collarbone—the one he had gifted her on their first anniversary. "You look stunning," he murmured.

Before she could respond, a familiar laugh cut through the air. Isabella Davis, dressed in a sleek silver gown, glided toward them with a glass of champagne in hand. "There you are," she purred, her eyes locked onto Nathaniel. "I was wondering when you'd finally grace us with your presence."

Evelyn’s grip tightened around her clutch. She had known Isabella would be here—after all, she was still close with the Martin family—but that didn’t make it any easier.

Nathaniel’s jaw tensed. "Isabella," he acknowledged coolly.

Isabella turned her attention to Evelyn, her smile sharp. "Evelyn, darling, how lovely to see you again. I heard about the trouble with your latest project. Such a shame."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. The project in question had been sabotaged—mysteriously—just days after Isabella had visited the construction site. Coincidence? She doubted it.

"Every project has its challenges," Evelyn replied smoothly. "But we always find a way to overcome them."

Isabella’s smirk faltered slightly.

Just then, Edward Martin, Nathaniel’s grandfather, appeared beside them, his sharp eyes missing nothing. "Ah, my favorite trio," he said, though his tone held a hint of warning. "Nathaniel, I need you for a moment. The investors from Tokyo have arrived."

Nathaniel hesitated, glancing at Evelyn.

"Go ahead," she said softly. "I’ll be fine."

As he walked away, Isabella leaned in, her voice a whisper. "You don’t belong here, Evelyn. You never did."

Evelyn met her gaze evenly. "Funny. Nathaniel seems to think otherwise."

Isabella’s eyes flashed with irritation before she forced another laugh and sauntered off.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, her mind racing. The night was far from over, and she had a feeling the real battle was just beginning.

Nathaniel's voice was sharp, cutting through the air like a blade. There was no room for negotiation in his tone.

As he finished speaking, a series of coughs wracked his chest, his agitation impossible to miss. Richard quickly handed him a glass of water, concern etched on his face. "Father, calm down. Now that he's back, you can deal with him properly."

Evelyn stood frozen at the entrance of the dining room, her expression a mix of confusion and hesitation. She didn’t know whether to step forward or retreat. Her voice was barely above a whisper as she greeted them. "Edward, Richard, Victoria..."

Victoria was the first to notice Evelyn’s presence, her eyes widening slightly before she rushed over. Taking Evelyn’s hand, she said gently, "Edward, it’s Evelyn."

Then, turning back to Evelyn, she reassured her, "Edward thought you were Nathaniel. He wasn’t talking about you. Don’t take it to heart."

Evelyn gave a small nod, forcing a faint smile. "I understand."

Edward seemed momentarily taken aback when he saw Evelyn, but his expression softened almost instantly. He motioned for her to sit beside him, murmuring, "My dear, you’ve endured so much."

Evelyn shook her head slightly. "Edward, please don’t say that. It’s really nothing."

But the more Evelyn downplayed it, the heavier Edward’s heart grew.

He sighed. "I know exactly what kind of despicable things he’s done. Don’t worry—I’ll have a word with him. Tomorrow, I’ll go to the Martin Group and settle this once and for all."

"Edward, that’s actually why I came back today. If Nathaniel thinks I’m not the right fit for this project, I can step aside. But Summit Realty shouldn’t suffer because of me. If they’re cut out, they’ll struggle to survive in this industry."

Edward understood her concern and nodded in agreement.

Then, he shot Richard a meaningful look. "Call him back. This needs to be resolved—now!"

Evelyn bit her lip lightly before speaking again. "Edward, please don’t be angry. Maybe he’s doing this for the good of the Martin Group. My company and I might not be significant enough to partner with you, but Summit Realty is different. They’re an established enterprise. So, I just want you to talk to him—give them a chance."

"So, you’re advocating for Summit Realty. What about yourself?" Edward asked, his voice laced with concern.

Evelyn simply smiled. "I’m still young. There’s plenty of time for me to grow."

Richard and Victoria nodded in agreement, but Edward remained silent, lost in thought.

Evelyn didn’t stay much longer—it was getting late.

Edward insisted on walking her to her car. As they strolled side by side, he spoke softly. "Evelyn, my dear. I’m sorry you’ve had to go through all this."

"Edward, please don’t apologize. I’m happy now."

With a slow nod, Edward changed the subject. "How have you been feeling? And how’s the baby?"

"We’re both doing well. No need to worry," Evelyn reassured him, resting a hand on her abdomen. Every day, she could feel the subtle changes, the deepening bond between them.

After a few more words of advice, Edward watched as Evelyn drove off into the night.

As Evelyn left Martin Manor, she passed Nathaniel’s car at a nearby intersection. Their windows were down, and for a brief moment, their eyes met. Neither stopped. Neither spoke.

What Evelyn didn’t know was that Nathaniel would later appear at her doorstep, knocking insistently.

She had already fallen asleep when the sound roused her. Seeing him standing there, she didn’t invite him in, simply asking, "What do you want at this hour?"

###Chapter 159

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, blinking against the light. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady.

She slipped out of bed, careful not to wake him. The events of last night still lingered in her mind—the gala, the whispers, the way Isabella had looked at Nathaniel with that familiar, possessive gleam.

Evelyn padded to the window, gazing at the manicured gardens below. The estate was quiet, save for the distant hum of the staff preparing for the day.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she murmured.

The door creaked open, and Alfred stepped inside, carrying a silver tray. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin. Your coffee, as requested."

"Thank you, Alfred." She accepted the cup, savoring the rich aroma.

"Is there anything else you require?"

She hesitated. "Actually, yes. Could you arrange for a car? I need to visit the office early."

Alfred nodded. "Of course. Shall I inform Mr. Martin?"

"No, let him sleep." She took another sip, the warmth spreading through her. "He had a long night."

As Alfred retreated, Evelyn turned back to the window. The peace of the morning was deceptive. Beneath the surface, tension simmered.

Isabella was back.

And Evelyn wasn’t naive enough to think it was a coincidence.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory: Emergency meeting at 9. Summit Realty is making moves.

She exhaled sharply. Just what she needed—another crisis.

Nathaniel shifted in bed, his voice rough with sleep. "Everything okay?"

She forced a smile. "Just work. Go back to sleep."

But as she dressed, her mind raced. Between Isabella’s sudden reappearance and Summit Realty’s scheming, the day promised chaos.

And Evelyn was ready for it.

The clock had long struck midnight.

Nathaniel's expression was icy, sending chills down Evelyn's spine. Their gazes locked, his narrowed eyes burning with barely restrained fury. "You're seriously locking me out?"

Evelyn crossed her arms, her voice cool. "It's late. You should leave."

"So that's how it is?" His jaw tightened. "Evelyn, need I remind you? We're still married."

"Funny," she countered, tilting her head. "This morning, you made it perfectly clear you wanted nothing to do with me. Changed your mind already?"

His voice dropped dangerously low. "Last chance. Are you letting me in or not?"

Nathaniel stood unmoving in the doorway, his presence dominating the space. His eyes—dark, unreadable—were like a storm brewing beneath calm waters.

Evelyn held his gaze without flinching. "And if I refuse? Will you destroy my company by dawn?"

"Why would I?" A bitter smirk twisted his lips. "With my grandfather and parents backing you, what power do I even have?"

The sarcasm in his tone was sharp enough to cut. Then, almost lazily, he added, "But others… might not be so generous."

With that, Nathaniel turned on his heel and stepped into the elevator, vanishing from sight.

The air still crackled with tension long after he left. Evelyn remained rooted in place, replaying his words.

One thing was certain—when Nathaniel Martin made a threat, he meant it.

Was this about dragging Edward into their mess? she wondered.

But what choice did she have? She could endure his wrath, but she wouldn’t let others suffer because of her.

Evelyn didn’t regret her decision.

Sleep never came that night.

At dawn, her phone buzzed.

"Gregory," she answered, rubbing her temples.

"Tell me it's not true." His voice was tense, edged with something she couldn’t place. "You and Nathaniel—are you divorced?"

Evelyn froze. "What?"

"It's all over the news. Headlines claiming you two have split. No statement from Nathaniel’s side yet."

She immediately pulled up the articles. The rumors had exploded overnight, painting their marriage as over.

So this was his warning.

Her expression remained unreadable. "Ignore the gossip."

Gregory exhaled. "Alright. But Evelyn… are you okay?"

"I'm fine."

"You don’t sound fine." His concern was palpable. "Take the day off if you need to."

"I said I'm fine." She forced steadiness into her voice. "Just focus on Summit Realty. I spoke with Edward last night. He’ll talk to Nathaniel. Even if I’m out, the company shouldn’t pay for my mistakes."

Gregory sighed. "You always put others first. But Summit Realty’s taking hits too. Why should we suffer when we’ve done nothing wrong?"

"Drop it," she said firmly. "I won’t have anyone else caught in the crossfire."

For her, a clear conscience was non-negotiable.

By midday, the rumors had spiraled into a full-blown scandal. Neither Evelyn nor Nathaniel had addressed them.

Their silence spoke louder than words.



###Chapter 160

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew over the blueprints, making precise adjustments with her mechanical pencil. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint aroma of ink from the prints.

Gabrielle knocked lightly before entering, balancing a tablet and two steaming mugs. "The revised estimates from Summit Realty just came in," she announced, placing one mug near Evelyn's elbow. "Sebastian Wilson's team wants to move up the groundbreaking by two weeks."

Evelyn's pencil stilled. "That's impossible with the current timeline." She took a sip of coffee, the bitterness grounding her thoughts. "Tell Jonathan Blake we need at least—"

Her phone buzzed insistently. Nathaniel's name flashed on the screen. She excused herself with a glance at Gabrielle, who nodded and retreated.

"Darling," Nathaniel's voice carried an unusual tension. "We need to talk about the gala tonight."

Evelyn's stomach tightened. "Is everything alright?"

A pause. Then, "Isabella just confirmed her attendance."

The pencil snapped between Evelyn's fingers. Outside, a sudden gust of wind rattled the windows as if echoing her turmoil. She forced her voice steady. "I see."

"I can have Samuel make our excuses—"

"No." Evelyn wiped graphite dust from her hands. "We'll go. Let's not give her the satisfaction."

The line hummed with Nathaniel's reluctant agreement. As she ended the call, Evelyn caught her reflection in the glass—the determined set of her jaw, the fire in her hazel eyes. Tonight would be a battlefield in silk and champagne.

Gabrielle reappeared, holding out a garment bag. "Your dress just arrived from Seraphina's studio." She unzipped it partially, revealing a cascade of emerald-green fabric that shimmered like dragon scales. "She says it's armored elegance."

Evelyn traced the intricate beading. Perfect. If Isabella wanted war, she'd get it—in a dress that could deflect daggers.

The intercom buzzed. "Ms. Mitchell?" Alfred's cultured tones filtered through. "Your mother is on line two. Something about your sister's graduation?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Another crisis. Another role to play. She reached for the phone, already composing her smile. The day stretched before her like a tightrope—one misstep away from disaster.

The internet was ablaze with speculation.

"Didn't they just get married?"
"Was their grand announcement just a prelude to a breakup?"
"Did Nathaniel leave Evelyn for Isabella?"
"Everyone knows Nathaniel never truly loved Evelyn. That marriage was just for show. Now that his real love is back, why pretend?"
"Why the silence? Is this their way of announcing a divorce?"
"Looks like it. The Martin Group hasn’t denied anything."

The rumors swirled, yet Nathaniel and his family remained silent.

Evelyn shut her laptop with a sharp click, her mind racing. What was Nathaniel playing at?

But before she could decipher his motives, the Mitchell household erupted in chaos.

Fresh off their recent success, the Mitchell family now faced disaster. The moment whispers of Nathaniel and Evelyn’s impending split surfaced, business partners withdrew. Contracts dissolved. Promises were broken. The Mitchell Group was bleeding money.

Her parents wasted no time summoning her home.

Evelyn hesitated. "Can’t we discuss this over the phone?"

"Evelyn!" Margaret snapped. "Are you really ignoring your family now? Get back here. Your grandmother is visiting."

Frowning, Evelyn hung up and dialed Beatrice. The line was busy. It was clearly a trap, but she couldn’t risk ignoring her grandmother. Reluctantly, she headed home.

For Evelyn, Beatrice was the only one who mattered.

The moment she stepped inside, she knew she’d been played. She glared at Margaret, frustration simmering. "Was this necessary?"

"If I hadn’t lied, would you have come?" Margaret shot back, unrepentant.

Evelyn’s expression remained cold, though her eyes flashed with irritation.

William cut in. "Enough. This isn’t the time for arguments. What we need to know is—are you and Nathaniel really divorcing?"

Evelyn answered flatly, "No."

"Good." William exhaled. "Then you need to get pregnant. A child will secure your place in the Martin family. Nathaniel’s parents and Edward adore you, but ultimately, your marriage depends on him."

His words were blunt, expecting compliance.

Evelyn stayed silent.

William’s brow furrowed. "Well? Do you have something to say?"

"I won’t do it," she stated, her voice firm.

She met William’s gaze, watching his expression darken, then continued, "I refuse to be a pawn. Nathaniel and I are already planning to separate. Bringing a child into this would only hurt them."

"A pawn?" Margaret scoffed. "How dare you speak like that, Evelyn! After everything we’ve done for you!"

William’s anger flared. "Even if you divorce, it hasn’t happened yet. If you have a child and still split, the Martins won’t abandon you. It would benefit our family."

"And that’s exactly what makes the child a pawn," Evelyn said icily. "Why does our family’s survival depend on Nathaniel’s pity? Have we been beggars all this time?"

"How dare you!" William slammed his fist on the table, his voice thunderous.

The tension in the room spiked.

Just then, the maid announced, "Sir, Madam, Mr. Martin is here."

Evelyn turned—and locked eyes with Nathaniel as he stepped inside.

Her pulse skipped.

What is he doing here?



###Chapter 161

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, blinking against the light as she turned to find Nathaniel already awake, his piercing gaze fixed on her.

"You're up early," she murmured, her voice still thick with sleep.

Nathaniel's lips curved into a slow, knowing smile. "Couldn't sleep." His fingers brushed a strand of hair from her face, lingering against her cheek. "You were talking in your sleep again."

Evelyn frowned, sitting up. "What did I say?"

"Something about blueprints and deadlines." His chuckle was low, warm. "Even in your dreams, you're working."

She rolled her eyes but couldn't suppress a grin. "Well, someone has to keep this household running."

His expression darkened slightly, a shadow passing over his features. "Speaking of work," he began, his tone shifting, "I need to talk to you about something."

Evelyn's stomach tightened. That tone never meant anything good. "What is it?"

Nathaniel exhaled, running a hand through his tousled hair. "Edward called last night. He wants to meet."

Her breath hitched. Edward Martin—Nathaniel's grandfather—was a force to be reckoned with. Every encounter with him was like stepping onto a battlefield. "When?"

"Today."

Evelyn's fingers clenched around the sheets. "And you're just telling me now?"

"I didn't want to ruin your evening," he admitted, his gaze dropping.

She swallowed hard, forcing herself to stay calm. "What does he want?"

Nathaniel hesitated, then met her eyes. "He didn't say. But it's never just a friendly chat."

A knock at the door interrupted them. Alfred's voice came through, polite but firm. "Mr. Martin, your car is ready."

Nathaniel sighed, pressing a quick kiss to Evelyn's forehead. "We'll figure it out."

As he left, Evelyn sat frozen, her mind racing. Whatever Edward wanted, it wouldn't be good. And she had a sinking feeling their fragile peace was about to shatter.

Downstairs, the scent of freshly brewed coffee filled the air. Rosalind, their new chef, bustled about the kitchen, humming softly. Evelyn barely registered it.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Gregory. "Emergency meeting at the office. Need you here ASAP."

Evelyn groaned. Of course. Because today wasn't complicated enough already.

She grabbed her bag, her thoughts a whirlwind of deadlines, meetings, and whatever storm Edward was about to unleash.

One thing was certain—today was going to be hell.

Their gazes locked for a fleeting moment—Nathaniel's expression was unreadable, his features schooled into perfect neutrality. Then, without a word, he turned his attention to William. "What's the meaning of this?"

William scrambled forward, gesturing toward the plush armchair with exaggerated deference. "Nathaniel, we truly appreciate you coming on such short notice. Please, have a seat." He poured coffee with practiced ease, the steam curling between them.

Nathaniel didn’t move. "Get to the point."

William cleared his throat. "Right. Well, we thought it best if Evelyn apologized to you. Given the... silence from your end, we assumed she must have done something to upset you."

Silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating. Nathaniel’s eyes flicked to Evelyn, his gaze sharp enough to cut glass. The weight of it made her parents shift uncomfortably, their conviction in her guilt solidifying.

Margaret rushed to Evelyn’s side, nudging her forward. "Darling, just say you're sorry. You’re married—these little disagreements happen. A simple apology will fix everything."

Evelyn’s lips pressed into a thin line. She looked at her parents, the cold realization settling in her chest like ice.

These were the people who were supposed to love her unconditionally.

Her voice was steel. "And what, exactly, am I apologizing for?"

"It doesn’t matter what you did!" William snapped. "Just apologize and be done with it!"

Evelyn’s gaze flicked to Nathaniel, seated like a king on their sofa, his presence commanding the room. The humiliation burned, but she refused to bend.

She lifted her chin. "No. I won’t apologize when I’ve done nothing wrong."

"Evelyn!" William’s face darkened. "Is this how we raised you? You’ve always been so stubborn—no wonder Nathaniel wants a divorce! Apologize now!"

"Enough." Nathaniel’s voice cut through the room like a blade. His eyes were glacial as they locked onto William. "Did you summon me here just to force my wife into an apology?"

William faltered. "I—well, with all the rumors about your divorce, I thought perhaps Evelyn had—"

"You’d believe gossip over your own daughter?" Nathaniel’s tone dripped with disdain. "You’re her parents. Shouldn’t you be standing by her instead of throwing her to the wolves?" His lips curled. "Frankly, I’m starting to question if she’s even yours."

The words landed like a slap.

Nathaniel’s expression was unyielding, his gaze locked onto Evelyn’s with something she hadn’t expected—protection.

Margaret recovered first, forcing a laugh. "Oh, Nathaniel, you’re absolutely right. We were just worried, that’s all." She turned to Evelyn, her smile brittle. "Sweetheart, we didn’t mean to upset you. You know we only want what’s best for you."

Evelyn barely heard her.

Nathaniel’s voice was low, deliberate. "Evelyn is my wife. She doesn’t bow to anyone—not even you." His eyes never left hers as he added, "And as long as she bears my name, no one will disrespect her."

Margaret’s smile tightened. "Of course, of course. We’re so lucky to have you as her husband."

Evelyn exhaled slowly, the weight on her chest lifting just a fraction.

Nathaniel had just drawn a line in the sand—and for once, it was for her, not against her.
###Chapter 162

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, she felt the weight of countless eyes on her. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the assembled guests, their murmurs a low hum beneath the classical music. She tightened her grip on Nathaniel’s arm, drawing strength from his steady presence.

“Relax,” he murmured, his breath warm against her ear. “They’re just curious about the woman who finally tamed me.”

Evelyn rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress a small smile. “Tamed? You make it sound like I wrestled you into submission.”

Nathaniel smirked. “Didn’t you?”

Before she could retort, a familiar voice cut through the crowd. “Evelyn! Nathaniel!”

Isabella Davis glided toward them, her emerald-green gown shimmering under the lights. Her smile was polished, practiced—too perfect.

“Isabella,” Nathaniel greeted, his tone neutral.

Evelyn forced a polite smile. “You look stunning.”

Isabella’s gaze flickered between them, lingering on Nathaniel just a second too long. “I’m so glad you both could make it. Edward was just asking about you.”

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. Edward Martin’s approval meant everything in this world, and she still wasn’t sure where she stood with him.

“We should go say hello,” Nathaniel said, sensing her unease. He gave Isabella a curt nod before guiding Evelyn away.

As they moved through the crowd, Evelyn caught snippets of conversation—whispers about her, about Nathaniel, about their whirlwind marriage. She straightened her shoulders, refusing to let the gossip get to her.

Then she saw him.

Edward Martin stood near the fireplace, his silver hair gleaming, his posture as regal as ever. His sharp eyes locked onto hers, and for a moment, the room seemed to fade away.

“Evelyn,” he said, his voice deep and measured. “I’ve been waiting to speak with you.”

Her pulse quickened. This was it—the moment she’d been dreading and anticipating in equal measure.

Nathaniel squeezed her hand reassuringly before stepping back, giving her space.

Evelyn took a steadying breath. “Edward.”

The old man studied her for a long moment before his lips curved into a faint, approving smile. “You’ve got fire. Good. This family needs that.”

Relief flooded through her, but before she could respond, a commotion near the entrance drew everyone’s attention.

A woman stood there, her presence commanding silence. Dressed in a sleek black gown, her dark hair cascading over her shoulders, she was unmistakable.

Seraphina.

The legendary designer rarely made public appearances, and her sudden presence here sent a ripple of shock through the room.

Edward’s expression darkened. “What is she doing here?”

Evelyn glanced at Nathaniel, whose jaw had tightened. “I didn’t invite her,” he muttered.

Seraphina’s gaze swept the room before landing squarely on Evelyn. A slow, knowing smile curved her lips.

And just like that, Evelyn knew—this night was far from over.

Their so-called concern always managed to twist into her fault.

They urged her to apologize to Nathaniel—out of care, of course.

Everything they did was for her own good.

No matter what Evelyn said or did, they always spun it back on her, draping their accusations in the guise of love. The blame inevitably landed at her feet.

Evelyn almost laughed.

But she was used to this by now. With bitter amusement curling inside her, she tilted her head. "Since this has nothing to do with me, can I go?"

They looked to Nathaniel for permission, but he said nothing, his dark eyes locked on Evelyn. Unsure what to do, they fell silent.

Evelyn pressed her lips together and turned to leave.

Nathaniel’s gaze sharpened. He stood abruptly. William moved to stop him, murmuring something about company matters, but Nathaniel sidestepped him without a word and strode outside.

By the time he reached the driveway, Evelyn was already opening her car door. He caught her wrist, stopping her. His touch was warm, his voice deceptively soft. "Leaving without a word to me?"

She turned, their proximity sending a crackle of tension through the air. She met his gaze evenly. "Thanks for defending me. And sorry you had to see that mess."

Nathaniel lifted her chin with two fingers, his voice dropping lower. "That’s all?"

Evelyn blinked at him, silent.

He scoffed, his stare burning into her. His eyes were dark, stormy—full of something unreadable. "Why didn’t you fight back? Where’s that sharp tongue you always use on me? Evelyn, do I look like the only one you’re allowed to challenge?"

She tried to look away. "No."

"Then why stay quiet? Where’s that fire?" he pressed.

Evelyn said nothing.

Nathaniel exhaled roughly. "You looked like a wounded bird in there."

Her breath hitched. She met his gaze, her voice barely a whisper. "So now you’re going to pick on me too?"

Nathaniel smirked, but there was no humor in it. "If I wanted to pick on you, you wouldn’t still be standing here unharmed."

Evelyn knew he was right. If Nathaniel had played along earlier, her parents would’ve forced her to grovel at his feet by now.

He released her chin, instead brushing his thumb lightly over her cheek. His voice was low, almost intimate. "Look how they treat you without me. Evelyn, even now—are you still set on leaving?"

Her chest tightened.

His words were a reminder: without him, she was nothing. As Nathaniel’s wife, no one dared disrespect her. But once that title was gone? This would become her reality.

She swallowed. "Nathaniel, are you defending me just to change my mind about the divorce?"

He didn’t answer, just watched her with that unreadable gaze.

Evelyn continued, "But hasn’t our relationship always been separate from outside influence?"

Something flickered in his eyes—dark, dangerous. His voice was cool. "Reasons don’t matter. I just need to know one thing." He stepped closer, his breath brushing her lips. "Are you leaving me, no matter what?"
###Chapter 163

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, she felt the weight of countless eyes on her. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the assembled guests, their whispers like rustling leaves in the wind. She tightened her grip on Nathaniel’s arm, drawing strength from his steady presence beside her.

“Relax,” he murmured, his lips brushing her ear. “They’re just curious.”

She forced a smile, though her pulse raced. The Martins’ annual gala was more than just a social event—it was a battlefield of alliances and veiled threats. And tonight, she was walking into it as Nathaniel’s wife.

Across the room, Isabella stood with Vanessa, her sharp gaze locked onto Evelyn. The former flame had returned, dressed in a daring crimson gown that screamed for attention. Evelyn exhaled slowly. She wouldn’t let Isabella rattle her. Not tonight.

Gregory approached, handing her a flute of champagne. “You look stunning,” he said, his voice low. “But you’re gripping that glass like it’s a lifeline.”

She loosened her fingers with a quiet laugh. “Just nerves.”

“Don’t let them see it,” he advised. “Half these people are waiting for you to stumble.”

Nathaniel’s hand settled at the small of her back, warm and reassuring. “They’ll be disappointed.”

Before she could respond, Edward Martin stepped onto the raised platform at the far end of the hall. The murmurs ceased instantly.

“Ladies and gentlemen,” he began, his voice carrying effortlessly. “Tonight, we celebrate not just our company’s achievements, but the future of the Martin legacy.” His gaze flicked to Nathaniel and Evelyn. “A future that is now brighter than ever.”

Isabella’s smile tightened.

Evelyn straightened her shoulders. She wouldn’t back down. Not from the whispers, not from the glares, and certainly not from the woman who still thought she had a claim on Nathaniel.

The game was on. And this time, she was playing to win.

A part of Evelyn still wished Nathaniel would deny it. It might sound cliché, but when it came to love, everyone had their selfish moments.

She met his gaze evenly, refusing to answer his question. Instead, she countered, "How do we revive the stalled project? Can we at least keep innocent parties like Summit Realty out of our personal mess?"

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable, his features as still as midnight waters—cool, deep, and unsettling. His voice matched that calm, but his eyes held a sharp edge as he replied, "If you stay married to me, you can do whatever you want."

"Whatever I want?"

"Naturally. You are my wife, after all."

Evelyn let out a humorless laugh.

"Nathaniel, you really don’t understand me, do you? I despise people who can’t separate business from personal vendettas, who resort to threats and manipulation. Even if I had doubts about this marriage, your tactics only solidify my decision to go through with the divorce."

His eyes narrowed slightly, a flicker of irritation darkening his gaze. "Evelyn, are you absolutely certain?"

"If I say yes, are you going to erase my company from Mayby?"

"Most likely." A cold smirk curved his lips, devoid of warmth, radiating nothing but arrogance. "So choose your words carefully."

"Yes, I’m certain about the divorce. And I mean it." Her voice was steady, her eyes unwavering, refusing to yield.

They stared at each other, tension crackling between them. Nathaniel’s expression remained icy, his displeasure evident in the tightness of his jaw. After a long, piercing look, he turned on his heel, slid into his car, and drove off without another word.

But Evelyn understood that look all too well.

It was a warning.

Don’t regret this.

But at this point, regret wasn’t an option.

She had never once reconsidered her decision.

Exhaustion weighed heavily on her—both mentally and physically. The thought of returning to her empty apartment was unbearable, and going back to her family was out of the question. So, she drove to the office instead. Even though the project was on hold, there were still blueprints to organize, alternative solutions to brainstorm.

This project meant more to her than any other. She had poured herself into it since the early days of her pregnancy, enduring every hardship alone. She refused to let it go.

Parking outside the office building, Evelyn decided to grab a quick bite. She had rushed to the Martin estate that morning, surviving on nothing but a single slice of toast.

As she passed the café downstairs, her gaze landed on a familiar figure—Gregory.

But he wasn’t alone.

A woman sat across from him, her back turned. Long, silky hair cascaded down her shoulders, and even from behind, she looked striking.

Evelyn hesitated, then chose not to interrupt. A small, relieved smile touched her lips before she continued on her way.

Back in the office, Gabrielle immediately followed her inside, buzzing with gossip. "Ms. Mitchell, did you see? A gorgeous woman just showed up for Mr. Wilson! But he didn’t seem happy at all—he actually told her not to come to the office again. Do you know who she is? Is she his girlfriend?"

"Gregory wasn’t happy?"

"Not at all! He looked annoyed, but she didn’t seem to care. Then he left with her."

"How gorgeous are we talking?" Evelyn asked, amused by Gabrielle’s enthusiasm.



###Chapter 164

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. She stood by the window, cradling a steaming cup of coffee, her mind racing with the events of last night. Nathaniel had been distant again, his eyes clouded with something she couldn't decipher.

Her phone buzzed on the countertop. It was a message from Gregory. "Emergency meeting at the office. Summit Realty is pulling out of the project."

Evelyn's grip tightened around her phone. This was the third client this month. She quickly typed back, "On my way."

As she grabbed her coat, the intercom buzzed. Alfred's voice came through, calm as ever. "Ms. Mitchell, Mr. Martin is here to see you."

Her heart skipped a beat. Nathaniel never visited her at home unless it was urgent.

She opened the door to find him standing there, his usual composed demeanor replaced by visible tension. His jaw was set, his eyes dark with unspoken words.

"We need to talk," he said, his voice low.

Evelyn stepped aside, letting him in. The air between them crackled with unresolved tension.

"Is this about Summit Realty?" she asked, trying to keep her voice steady.

Nathaniel shook his head. "No. It's about Isabella."

The name sent a chill down her spine. Isabella Davis—his ex, the woman who had haunted their relationship from the beginning.

"What about her?" Evelyn crossed her arms, bracing herself.

Nathaniel ran a hand through his hair, a rare sign of frustration. "She's back in town. And she's not alone."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "What do you mean?"

He met her gaze, his expression unreadable. "She's with Sebastian Wilson."

The name hit her like a punch to the gut. Sebastian Wilson—the ruthless CEO of Summit Realty, the man who had just pulled out of her project.

Evelyn's mind spun. "You think this is connected?"

Nathaniel's silence was answer enough.

Her phone buzzed again. Gregory. "Where are you? The entire team is waiting."

She looked up at Nathaniel, her resolve hardening. "I have to go. But this isn't over."

He nodded, his eyes never leaving hers. "I'll handle Isabella. You focus on your project."

As Evelyn rushed out the door, one thought echoed in her mind: This was no coincidence.

The game had just changed.

Gabrielle pondered for a moment before answering, "Couldn't make out her features. She had a scarf wrapped around her face and a wide-brimmed hat. But her eyes? Mesmerizing. And her voice—it sounded oddly familiar. Maybe she's someone from one of our business partners?"

"You're unusually intrigued by this, aren't you?" Evelyn arched a brow.

"Ms. Mitchell, do you know something? You can tell me—I promise I won’t breathe a word." Gabrielle leaned in, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.

Evelyn’s expression shifted subtly, though her tone remained composed. "If you're that eager to know, why not wait for Gregory to return and ask him yourself?"

"Really? You think he’d tell me?" Gabrielle took her words at face value.

Evelyn chuckled, shaking her head. "Enough gossip. Get back to work before your paycheck suffers for being too nosy."

Gabrielle clamped her mouth shut, taking the hint, and scurried back to her desk.

Watching her go, Evelyn couldn’t suppress a small smile. The fog of confusion in her mind was beginning to clear.

Yet, a nagging question lingered. Who was that mysterious woman with the hauntingly familiar voice?

"Could she really be a client?"

Shaking her head, Evelyn couldn’t piece it together. Still, a quiet warmth spread through her at the thought of Nathaniel expanding his social circle.

After finishing her tea, Evelyn turned her attention to reorganizing the project files. From inception to suspension, the project had consumed over five hundred meticulously drafted pages. Every detail was etched into her memory.

"Is this truly the end?"

Lost in thought, Evelyn’s phone buzzed with an incoming message.

A genuine smile curved her lips as she read it, her fingers swiftly tapping out a reply.

Just then, the office door swung open, and Gregory strode in, catching her mid-smile. "What’s got you so cheerful?" he asked, tilting his head.

Glancing up, Evelyn replied, "Just chatting with a friend."

Gregory settled into the chair beside her and handed her a steaming cup. "Your usual."

"Thanks," she murmured, accepting it but not yet taking a sip. Instead, her gaze fixed on him. "I saw you downstairs at the café earlier. Who was that woman?"

Gregory’s posture stiffened momentarily, surprise flickering across his face before he schooled his features. "You saw her? She’s just an acquaintance, nothing more."

"Then why the tension? I only caught her from behind. Gabrielle mentioned she was striking. Do I know her?" Evelyn propped her chin on her hand, a teasing glint in her eyes.

Relaxing, Gregory offered a soft smile. "No tension. Just didn’t want any misunderstandings."

"Fair enough," she conceded, pressing further. "So, who is she? Someone I’ve met?"

Her eyes held his, waiting.



###Chapter 165

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the marble floors of the Martin estate as Evelyn stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her fingers tracing the delicate condensation on her glass of iced tea. The quiet hum of the mansion was disrupted only by the distant chatter of staff preparing for the day.

Nathaniel entered the room, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders. "You're up early," he remarked, his voice laced with amusement as he loosened his tie.

Evelyn turned to face him, a small smile playing on her lips. "Couldn't sleep," she admitted. "Too much on my mind."

He crossed the room in a few strides, his presence commanding yet comforting. "Still thinking about the project?"

She nodded. "The deadline is tightening, and Gregory keeps pushing for changes. I just—" She exhaled sharply, frustration evident in her tone.

Nathaniel’s hand found hers, his grip warm and reassuring. "You’ll figure it out. You always do."

Before she could respond, the sharp ring of her phone sliced through the moment. She glanced at the screen—Isabella’s name flashed boldly.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. "Why is she calling me?"

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "Ignore it."

But curiosity gnawed at her. Against her better judgment, she swiped to answer. "Isabella?"

The voice on the other end was smooth, dripping with false sweetness. "Evelyn, darling. We need to talk."

Evelyn’s grip on the phone tightened. "About what?"

Isabella’s laugh was light, almost mocking. "Oh, just a little… history you might want to know about Nathaniel."

A chill ran down Evelyn’s spine. She met Nathaniel’s questioning gaze, her mind racing. Whatever Isabella had to say, it couldn’t be good.

"Meet me at the café on Fifth Avenue. Noon." The line went dead before Evelyn could refuse.

Nathaniel frowned. "What did she want?"

Evelyn swallowed hard, her pulse quickening. "She claims she has something to tell me about you."

His jaw clenched. "Don’t go."

But the seed of doubt had already been planted. Evelyn squared her shoulders. "I have to."

Nathaniel’s eyes flashed with something unreadable—anger, concern, perhaps even fear. "Evelyn—"

She cut him off with a shake of her head. "I need to know what she’s talking about."

The tension between them was palpable, thick enough to slice.

And just like that, the fragile peace of the morning shattered.

The café was bustling when Evelyn arrived, the scent of freshly brewed coffee mingling with the murmur of conversations. Isabella sat at a corner table, her designer sunglasses perched atop her head, looking every bit the poised socialite.

Evelyn slid into the seat opposite her, her posture rigid. "Get to the point."

Isabella smirked, stirring her latte lazily. "Always so direct. I admire that."

"Cut the act," Evelyn snapped.

Isabella’s smirk faded, replaced by something colder. "Fine. Did Nathaniel ever tell you about his little… arrangement with my father?"

Evelyn’s breath hitched. "What arrangement?"

Isabella leaned forward, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Let’s just say, his rise to power wasn’t as clean as you think."

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms. "You’re lying."

Isabella shrugged, feigning nonchalance. "Believe what you want. But ask yourself—why do you think he’s so desperate to keep you away from me?"

The words settled like poison in Evelyn’s chest.

She stood abruptly, her chair scraping against the floor. "This conversation is over."

Isabella’s laughter followed her as she stormed out, the café door slamming behind her.

Outside, the city buzzed with life, indifferent to the turmoil raging inside her.

What if Isabella was right?

What if everything she knew about Nathaniel was a lie?

The thought was unbearable.

And yet, it refused to leave her.

Back at the estate, Nathaniel was waiting, his expression unreadable.

"Well?" he demanded.

Evelyn met his gaze, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. "We need to talk."

The air between them crackled with tension.

Whatever came next, nothing would ever be the same.

Gregory's lips curled into a playful smirk. "So curious about my love life, Evelyn? Hoping I'll find someone soon?"

"Not at all," Evelyn quickly corrected, her cheeks warming at the implication. "I just care about you. If it's too personal, forget I asked."

She bit her lip, realizing she might have crossed a line. Some things were better left private.

After a beat of silence, Gregory's gaze deepened, locking onto hers. "Evelyn, it's not that I don’t trust you. You might have seen her around, but you don’t really know her. There’s nothing between us, so it’s not worth mentioning."

"Understood."

She nodded, offering him a small, reassuring smile.

Gregory shifted the topic smoothly. "Summit Realty has been blowing up my phone all morning, demanding to know when the project will resume. Given everything, what’s your stance? Are you staying with Nathaniel for the sake of the deal?"

Evelyn met his eyes calmly, her tone measured. "If they contact you again, tell them we need more time. There’s no quick solution. I’m doing everything I can, but this isn’t simple."

She deliberately avoided answering his last question.

Noticing her evasion, Gregory pressed further. "Evelyn, Nathaniel has frozen the project and ignored the divorce rumors online. Is this because of me? If so, I’ll talk to him—make it clear we’re just friends."

Evelyn shook her head. "Gregory, this has nothing to do with you. Why would you think that?"

"I just don’t want to be the reason you’re stuck in a difficult position. If I’m the problem, tell me straight. We’re partners, remember? We handle things together. I won’t let you suffer because of me. So, are you sure this isn’t about me?"

"Absolutely not. Don’t even go there."

She laughed lightly but expertly sidestepped the question about her marriage to Nathaniel.

Gregory didn’t push further. He didn’t want to upset her. Instead, he just watched her, his expression unreadable, his gaze growing heavier with something unspoken.

Back in his office, Gregory dialed a number. The call connected instantly.

"Lay low for now," he said coolly. "She noticed us at the café earlier. It’s not time for her to know yet."

The woman on the other end hesitated before replying softly, "Understood. But… when this is all over, will you really choose her?"

Gregory didn’t answer. He simply ended the call.

Standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, he stared down at the city below, feeling as if the ground beneath him was crumbling away.

7 p.m.

Evelyn arrived at the airport, and within minutes, she spotted a familiar figure at the arrivals gate. The woman wore a sleek black trench coat, knee-high boots, and a cascade of rich auburn curls framing her striking features.

They embraced tightly, and Evelyn whispered, "Charlotte, I’ve missed you so much!"



###Chapter 166

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort that could redefine Martin Group's portfolio.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called without looking up.

Gabrielle stepped inside, holding a steaming cup of coffee. "Thought you might need this. You've been here since dawn."

Evelyn smiled gratefully, accepting the cup. "Thanks. Just finalizing the details before the meeting with Nathaniel."

Gabrielle hesitated, then leaned in slightly. "Is everything okay? You've been... tense lately."

Evelyn exhaled, setting the coffee down. "It's just—this project is huge. And with Isabella back in town..."

Gabrielle's eyes widened. "She's back?"

Evelyn nodded, her grip tightening around her pen. "Nathaniel didn’t mention it, but I saw her name in his schedule. A dinner meeting."

Gabrielle frowned. "You think he’s hiding something?"

Before Evelyn could respond, her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel:

"Meeting moved to 3 PM. Can you make it?"

She typed a quick reply, then glanced at Gabrielle. "I need to go. Tell Gregory I’ll be back by noon."

Nathaniel stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows of his office, staring at the city below. His mind was elsewhere—on the past, on mistakes he couldn’t undo.

The door opened, and Samuel stepped in. "Sir, the contracts for the Singapore deal are ready for review."

Nathaniel turned, nodding. "Leave them on my desk."

Samuel hesitated. "Also, Ms. Davis called again. She insists on meeting you tonight."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Reschedule it."

"But she said it’s urgent—"

"I said reschedule it." His tone left no room for argument.

Samuel nodded and retreated, closing the door softly behind him.

Nathaniel ran a hand through his hair. He knew he couldn’t avoid Isabella forever. But the last thing he wanted was for Evelyn to find out—not when their marriage was finally on stable ground.

His phone rang. It was his father.

"Richard," Nathaniel answered, bracing himself.

"Son, we need to talk. It’s about the board meeting next week."

Nathaniel sighed. "What now?"

"Your grandfather is pushing for a vote on the new CEO. And he’s not on your side."

Nathaniel’s grip on the phone tightened. "I’ll handle it."

"You’d better. Because if you lose this, everything you’ve built—everything Evelyn’s worked for—goes down with you."

The line went dead.

Nathaniel stared at the phone, his mind racing. He had to fix this—before it was too late.

Evelyn arrived at the restaurant early, choosing a quiet corner table. She needed time to think before Nathaniel arrived.

But as she sipped her water, a familiar laugh caught her attention.

Her breath hitched.

There, at the bar, was Isabella—flawless as ever, her blonde hair cascading over her shoulders. And beside her, leaning in too close, was Nathaniel.

Evelyn’s heart plummeted.

She stood abruptly, knocking over her glass. Water spilled across the table, but she didn’t care.

She had to get out of there.

Before they saw her.

Before she shattered.

"Evelyn, I've thought about you every damn day!" Charlotte replied with a playful smirk.

They'd been inseparable since their freshman year, and time hadn't changed that one bit.

Fingers intertwined, they strolled toward the parking lot. Once inside the car, Evelyn turned the key in the ignition. "Hungry? I booked us a table at that Italian place you love."

"Lead the way, boss." Charlotte grinned, leaning back in her seat.

Evelyn shook her head with a quiet laugh. Beneath Charlotte's sweet, composed exterior was a woman who thrived on chaos.

The restaurant was packed, so they settled for a corner booth near the window. As they sipped their drinks, Charlotte studied Evelyn with narrowed eyes. "You've changed."

"How so?"

"Can't pinpoint it. Maybe it's the way you hold yourself now. Less... guarded." She twirled her straw. "Either way, I'm not leaving this time. We've got a year's worth of friendship to make up for."

Evelyn smirked. "Promises, promises."

"Try me."

They clinked glasses, laughter bubbling between them.

When their food arrived, conversation flowed effortlessly—work, travel, mutual friends. Despite the distance, they'd never truly lost touch.

Then, out of nowhere, Charlotte asked, "You sure your husband won't mind me crashing at your place?"

Evelyn's fingers stilled around her fork. "I don’t live there anymore."

"Wait—seriously?"

"Dead serious."

"But... why? I thought you two were solid."

"I want a divorce," Evelyn said flatly, her voice low. "We’ll talk more at home."

Charlotte's expression softened, concern flickering in her gaze. She simply nodded.

After settling the bill, they headed for the exit. But just as they reached the door, Evelyn froze.

Charlotte frowned. "What’s wrong?"

Evelyn’s face had gone eerily blank, her eyes fixed on something—or someone—across the room.

Following her line of sight, Charlotte spotted him—Nathaniel, standing near the hostess stand with three others: Isabella, and an older couple Charlotte didn’t recognize.

"Is this why you left?" Charlotte whispered.

Evelyn didn’t answer. "Let’s go."

"Just like that?" Charlotte scoffed. "That’s your husband. Shouldn’t we at least say hi? I’ve never even met the guy."

Evelyn shot her a look. "Patience. You’ll meet him soon enough."

"Wow. You’re really unbothered."

Evelyn just smiled.

Maybe she was used to it.

Or maybe she’d just stopped caring.

Outside, Nathaniel stood tall, his posture rigid as Isabella leaned in, whispering something that made her parents beam. Though Nathaniel’s expression remained neutral, there was something in his eyes—warmth, familiarity.

The older man clapped him on the shoulder. "Nathaniel, we can’t thank you enough for looking after our girl. Seeing you two together again... it’s like nothing ever changed."

Evelyn’s lips curled into a humorless smile.

How fitting.

Here was Nathaniel, playing the doting fiancé to Isabella’s family—while his actual wife walked away unnoticed.



###Chapter 167

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, the weight of Nathaniel’s absence pressed down on her like a physical force. The chandeliers cast shimmering reflections across the marble floors, but the opulence felt hollow without him there.

She tightened her grip on her clutch, her nails digging into the soft leather. Where is he?

Isabella’s laughter rang out from across the room, sharp and deliberate. The sound grated against Evelyn’s nerves. The woman had been circling the event like a predator, her crimson gown a blatant declaration of dominance.

Gregory leaned in, his voice low. "You okay?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Just tired."

But she wasn’t just tired. She was furious. Nathaniel had promised he’d be here tonight—promised—yet again, he’d vanished without a word.

A server passed by with champagne flutes. Evelyn snatched one and downed half of it in one go. The bubbles burned her throat, but the sting was grounding.

Then, the doors swung open.

Nathaniel strode in, his tailored suit immaculate, his expression unreadable. The murmurs in the room hushed as all eyes turned to him.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked.

He looked directly at her, his gaze dark and intense. But before she could react, Isabella was at his side, her hand slipping possessively around his arm.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted.

Gregory cursed under his breath. "You’ve got to be kidding me."

Nathaniel didn’t pull away.

The room blurred at the edges as Evelyn’s breath came faster. She set her glass down with deliberate precision, her fingers trembling.

Then, Nathaniel’s voice cut through the noise. "Evelyn."

Just her name. A command. A plea.

She turned on her heel and walked out.

The cool night air hit her like a slap. She barely made it three steps before Nathaniel caught her wrist, spinning her around.

"Let me explain," he demanded.

Evelyn wrenched free. "You don’t get to disappear and then show up with her and expect me to listen."

His jaw clenched. "It wasn’t like that."

"Then what was it?" she snapped.

Nathaniel hesitated—just for a second—but it was enough.

Evelyn stepped back, her chest tight. "I’m done waiting for you to choose me."

She turned and walked away, her heels clicking against the pavement.

This time, he didn’t follow.

The moment Evelyn saw it with her own eyes, a sharp pang pierced her heart, but she swallowed the urge to confront or demand answers.

A bitter smile tugged at her lips as she was about to suggest leaving, but Charlotte beat her to it. "Evelyn, steer clear of trash like that. If a man is married and still fooling around, toss him out. What’s the point? With your looks and money, you could have any guy you want. Trust me, younger men would kill for a woman like you—gorgeous, successful, and loaded."

If Charlotte didn’t have the last word, no one did.

Evelyn’s attempt to hush her came too late. Nathaniel and Isabella had already heard every unfiltered syllable.

Their eyes met—just for a split second—before Evelyn looked away.

She leaned in, whispering, "Are you done? Can we go now? If we stay any longer, we’ll be trending on social media, and it’s your first day in Mayby. Do you really want that kind of attention?"

Charlotte hesitated, then sighed. "Fine. Let’s bounce. I’ll shut up—just for you."

Evelyn shot her a grateful smile as they linked arms and strode toward the exit. Passing Nathaniel and Isabella, they didn’t spare them a single glance, heading straight for the parking lot.

Isabella glanced at Nathaniel, whose expression was unreadable as he watched Evelyn leave. She lowered her voice. "Should we explain things to her?"

"No need," he replied coolly.

Just then, Samuel pulled up in the car.

Nathaniel remained silent, reclining in his seat with his eyes closed, shutting out the world.

Isabella’s parents noticed and immediately asked what was wrong.

She forced a smile. "Nathaniel’s just exhausted from work."

With that flimsy excuse, they dropped the subject.

Thirty minutes later, they arrived at the hotel. Isabella escorted her parents inside while Nathaniel stayed behind. "I won’t be coming up. Make sure they’re settled."

She nodded gratefully. "Nathaniel, thank you for handling everything today. You should go home and rest."

With a quiet hum of acknowledgment, he signaled Samuel to drive off.

Only when the car vanished into the distance did Isabella turn to her parents. "Let’s go upstairs."

Her mother, Wanda, frowned. "Isabella, is Nathaniel really going to divorce her and marry you?"

A flash of irritation crossed her face before she smoothed it over. "Of course. Haven’t I told you? It’s happening. Stop worrying about it."

Adjusting her hat, she masked her emotions. "Let’s get some rest. I’m exhausted too. Enjoy your stay, and once I’m done with work, I’ll arrange your hospital check-ups."

Her parents nodded obediently, following her inside.

But instead of joining them, Isabella waited until they disappeared into the elevator before turning on her heel and calling her agent for a ride.

She didn’t notice the black car parked across the street—or the man inside watching her every move.

Samuel glanced at Nathaniel, who still had his eyes closed. "Mr. Martin, Ms. Davis didn’t go upstairs. Should we keep waiting?"
###Chapter 168

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort in the Maldives. The design was ambitious, but she thrived on challenges.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn nodded. "Send him in."

Gregory strode in, his usual confident demeanor slightly off. He dropped into the chair opposite her, running a hand through his tousled hair. "We have a problem."

Evelyn arched a brow. "What kind of problem?"

"The Maldives project. The investors are getting cold feet. They're concerned about the timeline."

She exhaled sharply. "We've accounted for every possible delay. What changed?"

Gregory hesitated. "Word is, someone's been whispering in their ears. Suggesting we're overpromising."

Evelyn's grip tightened on her pen. "Isabella." It wasn't a question.

Gregory gave a grim nod. "She's been seen at several investor dinners lately. Coincidence? I doubt it."

Evelyn leaned back, tapping the pen against her lips. "She's trying to sabotage us."

"Looks that way."

A slow smile curved Evelyn's lips. "Then it's time we remind her why she lost in the first place."

Gregory blinked. "You have a plan?"

"Always." She pulled out her phone and dialed a familiar number.

Nathaniel answered on the second ring, his deep voice sending a shiver down her spine. "Miss me already?"

Evelyn smirked. "Always. But I need a favor."

"Name it."

"Your grandfather's connections in the Maldives. Think you could arrange a meeting with the tourism board?"

There was a pause. "Isabella's been stirring trouble?"

"Understatement of the year."

Nathaniel chuckled. "Consider it done. But you owe me."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "I'll make it worth your while."

As she hung up, Gregory whistled. "Remind me never to get on your bad side."

Evelyn winked. "Too late for that."

Her phone buzzed—a message from Nathaniel.

"Dinner tonight. Wear the red dress."

Heat flooded her cheeks. The game was on, and Evelyn Mitchell never backed down from a challenge.

Especially not when the stakes were this high.

Nathaniel didn't respond immediately. His gaze lingered outside the car window for a long moment before he finally spoke, his voice cool and detached. "Have two men stationed here in shifts. I want to know if she came alone."

"Understood," Samuel replied.

Nathaniel waited until Isabella disappeared into Vanessa's car before allowing Samuel to drive off. But instead of returning to Pineview Villa, he abruptly ordered, "Pull over here. You're dismissed for the night."

Without another word, Nathaniel took the driver's seat and sped away, leaving Samuel standing alone on the dimly lit street.

Back at the apartment, Evelyn and Charlotte lounged on the couch. Charlotte glanced around the modest living space and frowned. "Evelyn, why are you staying in this tiny place when you could be living in a mansion? You should kick Nathaniel out and take the villa for yourself."

Evelyn chuckled softly. "Would you stop being my friend if I lived here?"

"Of course not," Charlotte huffed. "I just hate seeing you like this."

"I'm fine," Evelyn reassured her.

Charlotte's expression turned serious. "Tell me the truth—are you really ready to go through with the divorce?"

She knew better than anyone how deeply Evelyn had loved Nathaniel. Even though she'd never spoken to him directly, she'd heard enough from Evelyn to understand the kind of man he was.

Evelyn remained composed. "My decision is final."

After tonight, she had come to a realization.

Love might fade with time. Perhaps one day, she would stop loving him entirely—or maybe she never would. But none of that mattered anymore. Nothing could change her mind now.

Charlotte scowled, recalling the scene at the restaurant. "I know you're right, but it still makes me furious. That Isabella has no shame, flaunting herself around Nathaniel when she knows he's married. The more I think about it, the angrier I get."

Evelyn smiled faintly and pinched Charlotte's cheek. "Keep talking like that, and you'll make me cry."

"After everything I've said, you're still not moved?"

"I'm so moved I could burst into tears."

The mood lightened, but Evelyn exhaled quietly. Charlotte's words brought back the image of Nathaniel and Isabella together. Then something struck her—Isabella's outfit had looked strangely familiar.

Before she could dwell on it, Charlotte asked, "If you divorce Nathaniel, will you end up with Gregory?"

Evelyn frowned. "Where did that come from?"

Charlotte shrugged. "Just curious. He's always had feelings for you, hasn't he?"

Evelyn shook her head with a wry smile. "Don't bring it up in front of him. It'll only make things awkward."

"But would you ever consider it?"



###Chapter 169

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

She sighed, sitting up and running a hand through her tousled hair. The silence of the villa was deafening. Even Alfred, their ever-present butler, seemed to tread more quietly these days.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory.

"Evelyn, the client wants revisions by noon. Can you come in early?"

She groaned. Another rushed deadline. Another day spent buried in blueprints and contracts.

As she dressed, her gaze lingered on the framed photo on her vanity—her and Nathaniel on their wedding day, his arms wrapped around her waist, both of them laughing under a shower of rose petals.

That felt like a lifetime ago.

Downstairs, Rosalind had prepared breakfast—fluffy pancakes with fresh berries, just the way Evelyn liked them. But the plate remained untouched as she grabbed her keys and headed out.

The drive to the office was a blur. Her mind kept circling back to Nathaniel. The late nights. The missed dinners. The way he’d been distant ever since Isabella resurfaced.

Was he seeing her again?

The thought twisted her stomach.

Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was Charlotte.

"Girl, we need to talk. Coffee after work?"

Evelyn hesitated before replying. "Can’t. Deadline."

She knew Charlotte would see right through the excuse. But she wasn’t ready to admit—not even to herself—how much she was unraveling.

The office was already bustling when she arrived. Gabrielle, her assistant, handed her a steaming cup of coffee.

"Gregory’s waiting in the conference room," she said softly. "He looks… stressed."

Evelyn took a deep breath. "Aren’t we all?"

As she pushed open the conference room door, Gregory’s sharp voice cut through the air.

"Finally. We have a problem."

She braced herself. Another crisis. Another fire to put out.

But as she listened to Gregory’s rapid-fire explanation, her mind wandered.

Where was Nathaniel right now?

And why did she feel like she was losing him all over again?

"Absolutely not," Evelyn responded without hesitation.

"That's a relief." Charlotte seemed pleased.

Evelyn tilted her head curiously. "You really don’t like him, do you? I don’t recall you two ever having issues before."

Charlotte scoffed. "I can’t stand him. He puts on this noble act, but deep down, he’s a coward. He’s in love with you but hides behind friendship because you’re married. Doesn’t that make him a hypocrite?"

Her bluntness caught Evelyn off guard.

She knew Charlotte wasn’t one to gossip maliciously, but Gregory had been nothing but kind to her. She chose to stay silent.

Realizing she might have overstepped, Charlotte softened her tone. "I’m not trying to control who you befriend. I just want you to be careful. If you ever decide to be with him, I’ll support you—as long as you’re happy. I just—"

Evelyn cut her off with a small smile. "Relax, I won’t be with him. But since we’re being honest… I have a secret to share."

Charlotte perked up instantly. "What kind of secret?"

"I’m pregnant."

At first, Charlotte blinked, unimpressed—then her eyes widened in shock. "Wait, what? You’re pregnant?!"

Her voice echoed through the room.

Evelyn clamped a hand over her mouth. "Shh! I don’t want anyone else knowing yet."

"So Nathaniel doesn’t know?"

"Of course not. Only Edward and I know. You’re the third."

Charlotte grinned, squeezing Evelyn’s hand. "You’re amazing. Honestly, this divorce might be a blessing. Have the baby, and we’ll raise it together. We’ll find two hot, young dads for them later. Sound good?"

Evelyn laughed. "Sure, dream all you want. Just don’t let this slip in front of Nathaniel. I don’t want him finding out."

Charlotte raised a hand solemnly. "I swear on my life."

Evelyn studied her for a moment. "Did you really come to Mayby just for me?"

"Obviously! Who else would I come for?"

Charlotte’s cheeks flushed slightly, her gaze flickering away.

Evelyn smirked but didn’t press further. "My mistake. I thought maybe you had another reason—like that mysterious guy you refuse to call your boyfriend."

"He’s not my boyfriend."

"Oh? So just a fling then?"

"Evelyn! I flew all the way here for you, and this is how you repay me?"

"Sorry, sorry. Can’t help stating facts." Evelyn grinned just as the doorbell rang.

The two exchanged glances. Charlotte bit her lip. "Did I yell too loud? Are the neighbors complaining?"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes and moved to answer, but Charlotte stopped her. "Let me handle it. If they’re mad, I’ll leave tonight."

Evelyn nodded.

Charlotte opened the door with an apologetic smile—only to freeze when she saw Nathaniel standing there.

Nathaniel’s expression mirrored her surprise. He recognized her as the woman who had left the restaurant with Evelyn earlier. His voice was cool. "I’m here to see Evelyn."

"She’s asleep. What do you want?"

Charlotte blocked the doorway, her stance unyielding as she stared him down.



###Chapter 170

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, the weight of Nathaniel’s absence pressed heavily on her. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the marble floors, but the opulence felt hollow without him by her side.

She tightened her grip on her clutch, her nails digging into the soft leather. The last time she had been here, Nathaniel had held her hand, his warmth a silent reassurance. Now, she was alone, facing the storm brewing within the Martin family.

"Evelyn," a familiar voice called. She turned to see Edward Martin, Nathaniel’s grandfather, standing at the top of the staircase. His sharp eyes, though aged, still held the same commanding presence. "I’ve been expecting you."

She forced a polite smile. "Mr. Martin."

He descended the stairs with measured steps, his cane tapping lightly against the marble. "I assume you’re here about Nathaniel."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. "Yes. I need to know where he is."

Edward studied her for a long moment before sighing. "Come with me."

He led her to his private study, where the scent of aged books and polished wood filled the air. The moment the door closed behind them, Evelyn couldn’t hold back any longer.

"Please," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Tell me what’s going on."

Edward leaned against his desk, his expression unreadable. "Nathaniel has been called away on urgent family business. He didn’t have a choice."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. "What kind of business?"

"One that requires discretion," Edward replied cryptically.

She clenched her fists. "That’s not an answer."

For the first time, Edward’s stern façade cracked slightly. "Evelyn, you must understand—there are forces at play here that even Nathaniel can’t control. He left to protect you."

Her breath hitched. "Protect me from what?"

Before Edward could respond, the door burst open. Isabella stood there, her designer dress immaculate, her lips curled into a smirk.

"Well, well," she drawled. "If it isn’t the little architect, snooping where she doesn’t belong."

Evelyn stiffened. "Isabella."

Isabella sauntered in, her heels clicking against the floor. "Did Nathaniel not tell you? He and I have some unfinished business."

Edward’s voice cut in sharply. "That’s enough, Isabella."

But Isabella ignored him, stepping closer to Evelyn. "Face it, darling. You were just a distraction. Nathaniel always comes back to me."

Evelyn’s chest burned with anger, but she refused to let it show. "If that were true, you wouldn’t be here trying to convince me."

Isabella’s smirk faltered.

Edward cleared his throat. "Evelyn, I suggest you leave. Now."

She held Isabella’s gaze for a moment longer before turning to Edward. "Tell Nathaniel I’m not waiting around for answers."

With that, she walked out, her head held high. But the moment she stepped outside, her resolve crumbled.

Where was Nathaniel? And why did it feel like the walls of the Martin estate were closing in on her?

As she got into her car, her phone buzzed. An unknown number.

Her fingers trembled as she opened the message:

"If you want to see Nathaniel again, come alone. Midnight. The old docks."

Her heart stopped.

This wasn’t just family business.

This was a trap.

Nathaniel's brows furrowed as he spoke coolly, "Excluding travel time and freshening up, you've barely been back an hour. Is she truly asleep?"

"Mr. Martin, do you honestly believe I'd lie to you?" Charlotte arched a brow, her tone composed. "Even if she were awake, you should maintain your distance. After all, you're in the middle of a divorce."

At the mention of divorce, Nathaniel's striking features darkened, his expression turning icy.

His gaze pinned Charlotte as he replied flatly, "This is between Evelyn and me. That divorce was her unilateral decision—I never agreed to it."

"Considering you've already met Isabella's parents, isn't that crossing a line?" Charlotte crossed her arms. "Besides, Evelyn is free to date whoever she pleases now."

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed dangerously.

Charlotte remained unfazed. "Just stating facts. Surely you're not offended?"

"Either you bring Evelyn out here, or I go in."

"I told you—she's showering. You should leave."

"Are you her keeper?"

His voice dripped with disdain. Her sharp tongue grated on his nerves.

Internally, he resolved to distance Evelyn from Charlotte. The last thing he needed was her picking up bad influences.

Unaware of his thoughts, Charlotte shrugged. "Evelyn and I are best friends. Now, if you don’t mind? It's late, and I still need to introduce her to potential suitors. Given your impending divorce, she’ll want options."

Every word was a deliberate jab, and Charlotte made no effort to soften them.

Nathaniel's voice turned glacial. "Are you encouraging bigamy? I’m starting to question if you’re her friend or her enemy."

"You—!"

"Evelyn." He cut Charlotte off, his attention shifting to the bedroom door. "Either I come in, or you come out."

His tone brooked no argument.

Charlotte opened her mouth to retort, but Evelyn emerged just then.

Having overheard everything, Evelyn moved to stand beside Charlotte, both women effectively blocking the doorway. She met Nathaniel’s gaze evenly. "Can this wait until tomorrow? It’s not that late, but it’s hardly appropriate with company here."

"Then step out. We’ll talk elsewhere."

His voice was calm, but his jaw was tight.

Evelyn sighed. "What’s so urgent? Is it about what I saw earlier—you and Isabella at the restaurant?" A faint, detached smile touched her lips. "If so, save your breath. That’s between you two."

"Evelyn." His voice dropped, rough and low. "Come out. Now."

She didn’t budge.

Charlotte smirked. "Mr. Martin, she’s made herself clear. Must you force the issue? After everything, you should be hiding in shame, not harassing her."

Evelyn squeezed Charlotte’s wrist in warning.

Nathaniel’s gaze never left Evelyn. "Is that really how you feel?"


###Chapter 171

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, she felt the weight of countless eyes on her. The air was thick with tension, the kind that made her fingers curl into fists at her sides. She had expected resistance, but the sheer hostility radiating from the assembled family members was almost suffocating.

Nathaniel stood beside her, his posture rigid, his jaw set. His grip on her hand was firm, an unspoken promise that he wouldn’t let go. Not now, not ever.

Edward Martin, the patriarch of the family, sat at the head of the long mahogany table, his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn. "You expect us to accept this?" His voice was deceptively calm, but the undercurrent of disdain was unmistakable.

Evelyn lifted her chin. "I don’t expect anything, Mr. Martin. But I won’t apologize for loving your grandson."

A murmur rippled through the room. Victoria Martin, Nathaniel’s mother, let out a derisive scoff. "Love? Is that what you call it? Or is this just another scheme to get your hands on our fortune?"

Nathaniel’s grip tightened. "Enough." His voice was low, dangerous. "Evelyn isn’t here to defend herself against baseless accusations. If you have something to say, say it to me."

Isabella, standing near the window with her arms crossed, smirked. "Oh, how noble. But let’s not pretend this isn’t exactly what we all expected."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. She had known this confrontation was inevitable, but facing Isabella’s smug expression made her blood boil. "You don’t know anything about us."

Isabella arched a brow. "Don’t I? Or are you forgetting who was here first?"

Nathaniel stepped forward, his expression darkening. "That’s enough, Isabella. This isn’t about you."

The room fell silent, the tension so thick it was almost tangible. Then, Edward leaned forward, his fingers steepled. "Tell me, Evelyn. What exactly do you bring to this family?"

Evelyn met his gaze without flinching. "I bring myself. My work, my integrity, and my love for Nathaniel. That’s all I have to offer."

For a long moment, no one spoke. Then, to everyone’s surprise, Richard Martin—Nathaniel’s father—chuckled. "Well, she’s got spirit. I’ll give her that."

Victoria shot him a glare, but Edward merely studied Evelyn, his expression unreadable. Finally, he sighed. "We’ll see about that."

As the meeting dissolved into hushed arguments, Nathaniel pulled Evelyn aside. "I’m sorry," he murmured, his thumb brushing over her knuckles. "I didn’t expect it to be this bad."

Evelyn exhaled shakily. "Neither did I. But I’m not backing down."

He smiled faintly. "I know you’re not."

Across the room, Isabella watched them, her lips curling into a bitter smile. This wasn’t over. Not by a long shot.

And Evelyn knew—this was only the beginning.

Evelyn met Nathaniel's gaze, but before she could respond, Charlotte swiftly shut the door in his face.

With a firm click, Charlotte locked Nathaniel out.

She called through the door, "Mr. Martin, you should leave now. If the paparazzi catch you here, Ms. Davis might face another wave of online backlash."

Evelyn couldn't help but chuckle.

Charlotte winked at her before dragging her back to the couch. "The rumors say you two are already divorced, yet he's still tangled up with Isabella. He won’t sign the papers but can’t seem to let her go either. Is he deliberately using her to provoke you?"

"Or is it the other way around?" Evelyn countered dryly. "Maybe he’s using me to make Isabella jealous."

If Nathaniel truly wanted to get under her skin, he wouldn’t need such childish tactics.

If he had even an ounce of affection for her, why would she be so determined to end things?

Evelyn exhaled, her smile tinged with resignation.

Charlotte sighed dramatically, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. "Go ahead, cry if you need to. Men are replaceable. Tomorrow’s a new day—you’ll bounce back stronger."

Evelyn burst into laughter.

"Are you trying to comfort me or roast me?"

Charlotte rested her head on Evelyn’s shoulder, grinning. "Just sharing some hard-earned wisdom!"

"So, are you ever going to tell me about this mystery man of yours?"

"Don’t ask. I’ll blush."

"Please."

Charlotte clamped her lips shut, and Evelyn didn’t push further.

If Charlotte wanted to share, she would—eventually.

But curiosity gnawed at Evelyn. Who was Charlotte’s secret boyfriend?

11:00 PM | Luxe Lounge

The private club’s VIP room glowed under dim chandeliers. Two men clinked glasses on the plush leather sofa.

Nathaniel swirled his whiskey, his jaw tight. "What’s her game? Is she really this indifferent just because I pulled out of the deal? And that friend of hers—full of nonsense. She wouldn’t even let me inside. What’s that supposed to mean?"

Thomas smirked over his wine. "Nathaniel, are you in love with Evelyn? You sound like a scorned lover."

"Don’t be absurd." Nathaniel shot him a glare.

He’d turned the question over in his mind endlessly.

Evelyn was his wife. As long as that remained true, whether he loved her or not was irrelevant.

So why did it gnaw at him?

Nathaniel’s grip tightened around his glass.

Thomas chuckled but didn’t press further.

They drank in silence until Nathaniel noticed Thomas’s brooding expression. "What’s eating you?"

Thomas set down his glass with a sigh. "She’s back."

"The one who ghosted you?"

"Must you phrase it like that?" Thomas groaned.

Nathaniel arched a brow. "What’s the plan?"

Thomas downed the rest of his wine in one gulp. "Lend me your men. Now that she’s resurfaced, I’m tracking her down. Because of her, I was humiliated in front of Theodore and Felix."



###Chapter 172

The moment Nathaniel stepped into the room, the air shifted. His presence was magnetic, commanding attention without a single word. Evelyn felt her breath catch as his piercing gaze locked onto hers, the intensity sending a shiver down her spine.

"You're late," she murmured, crossing her arms.

A slow, knowing smirk curved his lips. "Missed me already?"

She rolled her eyes, but the warmth creeping up her neck betrayed her. "Hardly. We have a meeting to get through."

Nathaniel closed the distance between them in three long strides, his fingers brushing against hers before she could pull away. "Then let's not waste time."

The conference room was already filled when they entered—Gregory Wilson, her business partner, sat at the head of the table, flipping through documents. Beside him, Samuel Yates, Nathaniel’s ever-efficient secretary, adjusted his glasses as he reviewed the final proposal.

Evelyn took her seat, acutely aware of Nathaniel’s lingering touch on the small of her back before he settled beside her.

Gregory cleared his throat. "Now that we're all here, let's begin."

The meeting proceeded smoothly, though Evelyn found it hard to focus. Every time Nathaniel leaned forward to speak, his deep voice sent an unwelcome thrill through her. She clenched her fists under the table, willing herself to concentrate.

Then came the bombshell.

Gregory slid a document toward her. "We’ve been approached by Summit Realty. They want us to collaborate on their new luxury development."

Evelyn stiffened. "Sebastian Wilson’s company?"

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. "You know him?"

She forced a neutral expression. "Only by reputation."

A reputation that included ruthless business tactics and a history of undercutting competitors.

Gregory nodded. "They’re offering a substantial budget. It could be a game-changer for us."

Evelyn hesitated. Something about this didn’t sit right.

Before she could voice her concerns, Nathaniel spoke. "We’ll review the terms first." His tone left no room for argument.

The meeting adjourned shortly after, but as Evelyn gathered her things, Nathaniel caught her wrist.

"Talk to me," he demanded softly.

She met his gaze, the storm in his eyes mirroring her own unease. "I don’t trust Sebastian."

Nathaniel’s grip tightened slightly. "Neither do I."

A beat of silence passed between them, heavy with unspoken understanding.

Then, just as quickly, he released her, stepping back with that infuriatingly composed mask back in place. "We’ll handle it."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. If only she shared his confidence.

Because something told her this deal was more than it seemed—and the fallout could destroy everything they’d built.

Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto Thomas. "Are you certain justice is all you seek?"

"What else would there be?"

Thomas swirled his wine glass thoughtfully before countering, "Aren't you afraid you're falling for her?"

"You may doubt my methods, but never my intentions."

"And after justice is served?" Thomas pressed. "Will you discard her like the others? Or keep her close? Do you honestly believe the Fairchilds would allow it?"

Nathaniel's voice remained icy. "I don't need your concern. I have my plans."

Thomas scoffed but didn't push further.

The tense silence stretched until Nathaniel abruptly changed the subject. "Your birthday's approaching. Any grand celebrations planned?"

Evelyn would've remembered. She always did.

Last year, she had organized an intimate gathering at Pineview—just his closest friends, family, and Edward. Dinner had been elegant, the conversation effortless. No flashy parties, no corporate obligations. Just warmth.

Now?

The mere thought of Evelyn—of her determination to leave him—twisted something dark in his chest.

"Do I look like I'm in the mood for festivities?" Nathaniel snapped.

Thomas smirked. "Birthdays come but once a year. Leave it to me. I'll make it... memorable."

Nathaniel dismissed the offer with a wave. His mind was already elsewhere—plotting how to reclaim control over Evelyn.

He snatched his phone and dialed Samuel. "Dig up everything on that woman shadowing Evelyn. I want her gone."

The nuisance named Charlotte Bennett had overstayed her welcome.

Meanwhile, Charlotte sat curled on the sofa, Harper's phone buzzing incessantly in her grip. She ignored it until the ringing ceased—only for it to start again.

She answered on instinct.

"Mayby?" The voice on the line was razor-sharp. "Have you lost your mind? He's there. Do you have a death wish?"

Charlotte's fingers tightened around the device. "I'm visiting Evelyn. That's all."

"One week," the man hissed. "Return, or I'll drag you back myself."

The line went dead.

Charlotte exhaled slowly, her thoughts churning.

That night, while some slept soundly, others wrestled with storms of their own making.

The Marriage Game (Evelyn & Nathaniel)

###Chapter 173

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort in the Maldives. The design was ambitious, but she thrived on challenges.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Evelyn, Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn looked up, surprised. Gregory rarely visited her office unless it was urgent. "Send him in."

Gregory strode in, his usual confident demeanor replaced by tension. He dropped a thick folder onto her desk. "We have a problem."

Evelyn flipped it open, scanning the contents. Her stomach twisted. "This can't be right. The permits were approved weeks ago."

"Not anymore," Gregory said grimly. "Summit Realty filed an injunction. They're claiming our design infringes on one of their previous projects."

Evelyn's mind raced. Summit Realty—Sebastian Wilson's company. She had heard rumors about his ruthless tactics, but this was a direct attack. "We need to act fast. If this delays construction, we'll lose the investors."

Gregory nodded. "I've already called our legal team. But Evelyn…" He hesitated. "There's more. Someone leaked internal emails between you and Nathaniel about the project. The press is spinning it as favoritism because of your marriage."

Evelyn's breath hitched. The media had always been relentless, but this was personal. She clenched her fists. "Find out who did this."

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel: We need to talk. Now.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. The storm was just beginning.

Meanwhile, across town, Nathaniel stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows of his penthouse, staring at the city skyline. His phone screen displayed the latest headline: Martin Group Heir's Wife Accused of Unethical Business Practices.

Samuel Yates cleared his throat. "Sir, the board is demanding an emergency meeting."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Tell them I'll handle it."

But as he scrolled through the messages—some from furious shareholders, others from opportunistic rivals—he knew this wasn't just about business. Someone was targeting Evelyn. And he would tear the city apart to find out who.

His phone rang. Isabella's name flashed on the screen.

Nathaniel hesitated before answering. "What do you want?"

Isabella's voice was smooth, almost amused. "I think you and I should talk. About your wife… and the mess she's in."

The line went dead.

Nathaniel's grip on the phone turned white-knuckled.

The game had just gotten dangerous.

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the room. Evelyn and Charlotte rose early, freshened up quickly, and headed to the office together after a light breakfast.

The two women couldn’t have been more different in appearance and temperament.

Evelyn carried herself with quiet elegance—graceful, composed, and exuding an air of quiet strength beneath her polished exterior.

Charlotte, on the other hand, was all fiery charm—a vivacious beauty with a silver tongue, though beneath her confident facade lay a deeply sensitive soul.

Though it was Charlotte’s first visit to the company, she effortlessly struck up conversations with Gabrielle and the others, blending in as if she’d always belonged. The office buzzed with laughter, everyone instantly taken by her warmth. The only issue? She talked—a lot. Evelyn finally had to drag her into the office before she distracted the entire team from their work.

"Enough," Evelyn said, shutting the door behind them. "They have deadlines. If you keep chatting, they’ll be stuck here all night."

Charlotte smirked. "I was just helping them get to know you better."

"Thanks."

"Anytime."

Charlotte tilted her head, mischief dancing in her eyes. Then, lowering her voice, she asked, "Where’s Gregory? Did he hear I was coming and run for the hills?"

"Maybe you’re just that terrifying?"

"Evelyn!" Charlotte shot her a mock glare. "If I were scary, you’d be the first one I’d haunt."

"Terrifying," Evelyn deadpanned, just as a knock sounded at the door.

Gregory stepped in, carrying a basket of fresh fruit. "Evelyn," he said warmly, "I heard your friend was visiting. I assumed it was Charlotte. Thought I’d bring something for you both. How about lunch later? My treat."

His tone was kind, but Charlotte’s expression stiffened the moment he entered. Her earlier playfulness vanished, replaced by something unreadable.

Gregory faltered slightly at her reaction but maintained his polite smile.

Evelyn quickly intervened. "Thanks, Gregory. Charlotte just got in last night. Let her settle in first. We’ll have plenty of time to catch up later."

"Of course." He set the fruit on the desk with a nod.

As soon as the door closed, Charlotte turned to Evelyn, her voice dropping to a whisper. "So, back to what we were discussing—your post-divorce love life. What’s your type now? Someone young and reckless, or a refined older man?"

Evelyn’s brows knit. "Alright, enjoy the fruit. I have work to do."

She turned to Gregory, shifting the subject. "Any updates from Summit Realty?"

"Not yet. But I’m sure they’ve considered our proposal."

"Regardless, we need to be prepared. This mess started because of me. If they push for accountability, we can’t refuse. But don’t worry—if it comes to that, I’ll handle the compensation personally."

Gregory’s expression darkened. "Evelyn, do you really think I’m only here for the good times? That I can’t stand by you when things go wrong?"

His usual calm demeanor cracked, revealing rare frustration.

Evelyn met his gaze evenly. "That’s not what I meant. I just prefer to be upfront about these things. It’s how I operate."

A tense silence stretched between them.

Then Charlotte spoke, her tone light but edged with something sharper. "Mr. Wilson, Evelyn’s just being practical. You two are friends, after all. She doesn’t want to owe you anything she can’t repay." She paused, tilting her head. "Unless you’re expecting something else in return?"

"Charlotte," Evelyn warned under her breath.

Gregory’s jaw tightened, but before he could respond, the office phone rang, cutting through the tension like a blade.
###Chapter 174

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort in the Maldives. The design was ambitious, but she thrived on challenges.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn nodded. "Send him in."

Gregory strode in, his usual confident demeanor slightly frayed at the edges. "We have a problem," he said without preamble.

She arched a brow. "What kind of problem?"

"The investors for the Maldives project are getting cold feet. They're concerned about the timeline."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "We've accounted for every possible delay. What's really bothering them?"

Gregory hesitated before answering. "Rumors. Someone's been whispering that Martin Group is overextending itself, that Nathaniel might not have the capital to back this."

Her fingers clenched around her pen. "That's ridiculous."

"Is it?" Gregory met her gaze. "You know how these things work. Perception becomes reality."

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel: Dinner tonight? I have something to discuss.

Her stomach twisted. Was this about the rumors? Or something else entirely?

Across town, Nathaniel sat in his office, staring at the financial reports spread before him. The numbers didn't lie—Martin Group was solid. But someone was deliberately undermining their projects, and he had a suspicion who it might be.

Samuel entered quietly. "Sir, Ms. Davis is here to see you."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Send her in."

Isabella swept into the room, her designer dress clinging to her curves, her smile as polished as ever. "Ben—Nathaniel," she corrected smoothly. "It's been too long."

He didn't return the smile. "What do you want, Isabella?"

She pouted. "Is that any way to greet an old friend?"

"We were never friends."

Her eyes flashed, but she recovered quickly. "Fine. I heard about your little... troubles. I might be able to help."

His gaze turned icy. "How?"

She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a whisper. "I have connections. People who owe me favors. But I’d need something in return."

Nathaniel leaned back, his expression unreadable. "Name your price."

Isabella smiled. "I think you already know."

Evelyn arrived at the restaurant early, her mind still racing. The elegant setting—soft lighting, white tablecloths, the faint hum of classical music—did little to calm her nerves.

Nathaniel arrived moments later, his presence commanding as always. But there was something in his eyes—a tension she hadn’t seen before.

"You look beautiful," he murmured, kissing her cheek.

She forced a smile. "What did you want to talk about?"

He hesitated, then reached for her hand. "There are things you should know. About Isabella."

Evelyn's breath caught. "What about her?"

Before he could answer, her phone rang. It was Gabrielle. "Evelyn, you need to come back to the office. Now."

"What's wrong?"

"It's the Maldives project. The investors just pulled out."

Her stomach dropped. She looked at Nathaniel, his expression grim.

"Go," he said quietly. "We'll talk later."

As she hurried out, one thought echoed in her mind: Someone is playing a dangerous game. And she intended to find out who.

Charlotte quickly backtracked, "Alright, I'll keep my mouth shut."

Evelyn glanced at Gregory before saying, "Charlotte didn't mean it like that."

"I know what Charlotte implied. I crossed a line. As business partners, we should be transparent about company matters. I'd expect the same from you if our roles were reversed."

Gregory's words made Evelyn nod in reluctant agreement.

He didn’t linger. His expression darkened before he strode out of the office.

Evelyn and Charlotte exchanged looks. Charlotte lowered her voice. "Did I mess up?"

"At least you're self-aware." Evelyn shot her a look before settling behind her desk. She wasn’t actually upset—if anything, Charlotte’s bluntness had done her a favor. Now Gregory understood their relationship was strictly professional.

Evelyn spent nearly the entire day at the office, with Charlotte keeping her company.

At lunch, they ate takeout ordered by Gabrielle. Evelyn couldn’t hide her surprise. Charlotte, the shopaholic, had willingly skipped her usual retail therapy?

She studied Charlotte, who frowned. "Why are you staring at me like that?"

"You’re acting strange. Isn’t it torture for you to be cooped up here with me?"

"If you’re so worried about me being bored, ditch work and go shopping with me."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes, but before she could retort, her phone buzzed.

Nathaniel’s name flashed on the screen.

Charlotte saw it too and scoffed. "Don’t answer. Ignore him."

Evelyn had no intention of picking up. Whatever excuses he had for last night, she wasn’t interested.

She declined the call without hesitation.

He didn’t call back. A bitter smile tugged at Evelyn’s lips as she stared at her silent phone.

By six in the evening, Evelyn wrapped up work and left the building with Charlotte. But the moment they stepped outside, her phone rang again.

This time, she answered.

"Hello?"

"Get over here. I’m waiting in the car."

Evelyn froze, spotting the sleek black sedan parked nearby.

She didn’t move. "What do you want?"

"Evelyn, I said come here."

"Nathaniel, we can talk like this. I’m not alone."

"Should I arrange for Charlotte’s immediate return to Dattlech before you’ll cooperate?"

Evelyn wasn’t shocked he knew Charlotte’s name—Nathaniel always got what he wanted.

She stayed silent. The line went dead.

Charlotte frowned. "What did he say?"

"Go get the car." Evelyn handed her the keys. "He’s waiting. I’ll handle this."

"Fine." Charlotte didn’t argue. With Nathaniel parked outside, there was no avoiding him.

Once Charlotte headed to the parking lot, Evelyn turned toward the idling car.

The window rolled down as she approached.

Nathaniel’s voice was ice. "Get in."

Evelyn stood her ground. "Say what you need to say right here."

"My patience is wearing thin. This isn’t a negotiation. How many times will you test me?"
###Chapter 175

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn’s office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort in the Maldives. The design was ambitious, but she thrived on challenges.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, not looking up.

Gabrielle, her assistant, stepped inside, holding a steaming cup of coffee. "Thought you might need this. You’ve been at it since dawn."

Evelyn smiled gratefully, accepting the cup. "Thanks. I just want to finalize these details before the meeting with Summit Realty."

Gabrielle hesitated. "Speaking of which… Jonathan Blake called. He wants to move the meeting up to this afternoon."

Evelyn’s grip tightened around the mug. "Why?"

"He didn’t say, but he sounded… urgent."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Sebastian Wilson, Summit Realty’s CEO, had been nothing but difficult since the project began. Every meeting felt like a battle.

"Fine. Reschedule my afternoon."

As Gabrielle left, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A text from Nathaniel:

Dinner tonight? I have something to tell you.

Her heart skipped. Lately, Nathaniel had been distant, lost in his own world of corporate takeovers and boardroom politics. She typed a quick reply:

Of course. 7 PM at La Perle?

His response was immediate: Perfect.

She set the phone down, a knot forming in her stomach. What could he possibly want to discuss?

The Summit Realty office was sleek and impersonal, all glass and steel. Jonathan Blake greeted her with a tight smile.

"Evelyn. Thanks for coming on such short notice."

She forced a polite nod. "What’s this about, Jonathan?"

Before he could answer, the door opened, and Sebastian Wilson strode in, his tailored suit immaculate, his expression unreadable.

"Evelyn," he said smoothly. "We have a problem."

She arched a brow. "What kind of problem?"

Sebastian slid a folder across the table. "Our investors are concerned about the timeline. They want the resort completed by December."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. "That’s impossible. We agreed on next spring."

"Circumstances have changed." His tone left no room for argument.

She flipped through the documents, her mind racing. Rushing the project would mean cutting corners—something she refused to do.

"I’ll need to discuss this with my team," she said carefully.

Sebastian’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. "Of course. But time is of the essence."

As she left the office, Evelyn’s phone buzzed again. This time, it was Charlotte.

You need to see this.

Attached was a tabloid photo of Nathaniel leaving a high-end hotel with Isabella Davis—his ex—late last night.

Evelyn’s breath caught.

Suddenly, Nathaniel’s mysterious dinner plans made sense.

And she wasn’t sure she wanted to hear what he had to say.

Nathaniel's voice was frigid, laced with simmering fury. "Get in the car, Evelyn."

Without another word, Evelyn yanked open the door and slid into the passenger seat. The interior was suffocatingly silent, filled only with Nathaniel's distinctive scent—a subtle blend of expensive cologne and faint tobacco, uniquely his.

After a tense pause, Nathaniel spoke, his voice softer but no less intense. "Tell me, Evelyn. If I hadn’t brought this up, were you planning to avoid me indefinitely?"

She exhaled sharply. "Don’t be ridiculous. The divorce requires both of us. I can’t exactly disappear."

His jaw tightened. "So eager to end things?"

"That’s not what I said. You asked, and I answered."

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened. "Is this how you want to speak to me?"

Evelyn met his gaze evenly. "Then tell me, Nathaniel. What tone should I use?"

For a long moment, he simply stared at her, his emotions barely restrained. When he finally spoke again, his voice was eerily calm. "What you saw last night at the restaurant wasn’t what you think."

She arched a brow but said nothing.

"Isabella’s parents came to Mayby for medical tests. The situation was complicated, and they asked for my help. As a courtesy, I took them to dinner. Afterward, I dropped them at their hotel. Then I went straight to your place—but you refused to hear me out."

A flicker of irritation colored his words.

Evelyn’s fingers twitched in her lap. "I see. But you didn’t owe me an explanation. Whatever’s between you and Isabella is none of my concern."

His expression hardened. "That’s all you have to say?"

She held his gaze, silent.

Nathaniel scoffed. "No reaction at all?"

Reaction?

Oh, she had plenty. But she wouldn’t give him the satisfaction. Once, his explanations would have thrilled her. Now, they only fueled her suspicions.

So she steeled herself. She had to stop loving him.

Evelyn forced a shrug. "You said it yourself—this is between you and Isabella. My answer stands."

Nathaniel’s laugh was cold. Before she could react, his arm shot out, locking around her waist. In one swift motion, he hauled her against him, his lips crashing onto hers.

The kiss was relentless, possessive. She gasped, her hands fisting in his shirt as he deepened it, leaving her no room to breathe, no chance to resist.

Panic flared—they were parked on a busy street, in broad daylight. Anyone could see.

Desperate, she bit down.

Nathaniel barely flinched. He paused, just for a heartbeat, before claiming her mouth again.
###Chapter 176

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort in the Maldives. The design was ambitious, but she thrived on challenges.

Her phone buzzed, interrupting her thoughts. A message from Nathaniel:

"Meeting ran late. Dinner at eight?"

She smiled, typing a quick reply. "Perfect. I’ll be ready."

Just as she set her phone down, Gabrielle, her assistant, knocked on the door. "Evelyn, Gregory is here to see you."

Evelyn nodded. "Send him in."

Gregory strode in, his usual confident demeanor slightly off. He dropped a folder onto her desk. "We have a problem."

She flipped it open, scanning the contents. A rival firm, Summit Realty, had just secured a prime piece of land they had been eyeing for months.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Sebastian Wilson strikes again."

Gregory crossed his arms. "He’s been one step ahead of us lately. We need to act fast."

She tapped her fingers against the desk, mind racing. "Let’s schedule an emergency meeting with the team. We’ll reassess our strategy."

As Gregory left, Evelyn leaned back in her chair, staring at the ceiling. The competition was fierce, but she refused to lose. Not when she had worked so hard to establish her firm’s reputation.

Her phone buzzed once more—this time, a call from Charlotte.

"Evelyn, you won’t believe what I just heard," Charlotte said, her voice tinged with excitement.

Evelyn raised a brow. "What is it?"

"Cassandra Reed is hosting a charity gala next week. Rumor has it Sebastian will be there."

A slow smile curved Evelyn’s lips. "Perfect. We’ll need tickets."

Charlotte chuckled. "Already on it. But be warned—Isabella might be there too."

Evelyn’s smile faltered for a second before she steeled herself. "Even better. It’s time to face her head-on."

As she ended the call, Evelyn’s gaze drifted to the framed photo on her desk—her and Nathaniel on their wedding day. His arms wrapped around her, his smile genuine and warm.

She wouldn’t let anyone—not Sebastian, not Isabella—threaten what she had built.

Not now. Not ever.

The game was on.

Evelyn's eyes widened in disbelief. She never imagined Nathaniel could be so infuriatingly stubborn.

The car's interior suddenly felt suffocatingly small with him leaning so close. His intoxicating scent enveloped her as the temperature between them rose. Just as the tension became unbearable, his phone rang, forcing him to pull back reluctantly.

Yet he remained pressed against her, answering the call without moving an inch. A soft, feminine voice floated through the quiet space. "Nathaniel, are you finished? My parents wanted to invite you to dinner. Would that be possible?"

Fury surged through Evelyn. She shoved him away with all her strength, flung the car door open, and stormed out without a backward glance.

Nathaniel rubbed the spot on his head where she'd hit him, his gaze fixed on her retreating figure.

"Nathaniel? Where are you? What was that noise—" Isabella's voice drifted from the phone.

"Tell your parents I'm occupied tonight. We'll arrange another time," he interrupted sharply.

Isabella knew better than to push. "Alright. But what about the hospital check-up in two days...?"

"I've already instructed Samuel. He'll handle everything. Contact him directly if you need anything."

"Understood. I won't disturb your work then."

The moment she finished speaking, Nathaniel ended the call and tossed his phone onto the passenger seat. The lingering traces of Evelyn's perfume teased his senses. His fingers brushed his lower lip, where the sting of her bite finally registered.

Instead of annoyance, a slow smirk curved his lips.

He waited until Evelyn's car disappeared from the parking garage before turning his own vehicle in the opposite direction.

Inside her car, Evelyn sat rigidly, her expression icy. Charlotte stole glances at her while driving, unable to stay silent. "What happened? Did you and Nathaniel argue?"

"Don't mention him," Evelyn snapped. "I finally see him for who he really is—utterly shameless."

Her hands clenched into fists. None of it made sense.

He was the one who had filed for divorce. He was the one now refusing to sign the papers.

What game was he playing?

Did he expect her to agree to bear a child for him and Isabella?

The thought made her nails dig into her palms.

Charlotte hesitated. "Evelyn... have you considered why he's so against the divorce? Doesn't that strike you as odd?"

"What if I told you it's because of Isabella? Would you believe me?" Evelyn's voice was eerily calm, her face unreadable.

Charlotte frowned. "Are you sure? Did he actually say that to you?"



###Chapter 177

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her blueprints. She rubbed her temples, trying to focus, but her thoughts kept drifting back to Nathaniel.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Gregory.

"Meeting in fifteen. Summit Realty wants revisions."

Evelyn sighed. Another round of negotiations with Sebastian Wilson. The man was relentless.

She grabbed her tablet and headed to the conference room. The air was thick with tension as she entered. Gregory shot her a sympathetic look, while Jonathan Blake from Summit Realty leaned back in his chair, arms crossed.

Sebastian smirked. "Miss Mitchell, always a pleasure."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Let's get straight to the point. What changes do you want this time?"

Sebastian tapped his fingers on the table. "The client wants a more modern aesthetic. Less wood, more glass."

Evelyn clenched her jaw. "That contradicts the entire vision we agreed on."

Jonathan shrugged. "Market trends change."

Before she could respond, her phone rang. Nathaniel’s name flashed on the screen.

She excused herself and stepped into the hallway. "Nathaniel?"

His voice was tense. "Evelyn, we need to talk. It's about Isabella."

Her stomach twisted. "What about her?"

A pause. Then, "She's back in town."

Evelyn's grip tightened on her phone. Isabella Davis—Nathaniel's first love, the woman who had once shattered his heart.

And now, she was back.

Evelyn took a shaky breath. "When?"

"Last night. She called me."

The world around her seemed to blur. She barely registered Gregory calling her name from the conference room.

Nathaniel continued, his voice low. "I need to see you. Tonight."

Evelyn swallowed hard. "Okay."

She ended the call, her mind racing. Isabella’s return could only mean trouble.

And Evelyn wasn’t sure she was ready for what came next.

Back in the conference room, Sebastian raised an eyebrow. "Everything alright, Miss Mitchell?"

Evelyn straightened her shoulders. "Let’s finish this."

But her thoughts were already miles away—on Nathaniel, on Isabella, and on the storm that was about to hit her carefully constructed world.

Evelyn pondered silently, Did he personally tell me? No, not really.

She pressed her lips together, lost in thought. But is there really any difference between what Nathaniel did and telling me directly?

Charlotte, as if reading her mind, spoke up. "Evelyn, haven't you always trusted what you see and hear? Don’t tell me you’ve lost your judgment just because it’s Nathaniel we're talking about."

Evelyn blinked, her gaze momentarily clouded with uncertainty. But deep down, she already knew the answer.

A small smile curved her lips. "I understand."

"Good. So, where to now?"

"Let’s go. I’m treating you to dinner."

Evelyn pulled up the navigation on her phone and typed in the name of a restaurant. Charlotte drove them straight there.

Tonight’s choice was The Scarlet, one of Mayby’s most exclusive restaurants, renowned for its impeccable cuisine. Even Nathaniel, with his discerning palate, had praised it before.

Evelyn had reserved a private booth earlier that morning and pre-ordered their signature dishes.

The two friends chatted over dinner, the meal stretching leisurely over two hours.

When they finished, Evelyn stepped out to settle the bill. Charlotte didn’t insist on splitting it this time. But as Evelyn walked into the hallway, she nearly collided with Thomas.

"What a surprise!" she greeted.

"Indeed!" Thomas waved, excusing himself briefly from the man beside him before approaching her. "Got a minute to talk?"

Evelyn hesitated only slightly. "Of course."

They moved toward a quieter spot near the balcony. Thomas asked casually, "Dining with friends?"

"Yes. Charlotte’s visiting from out of town, so I’m showing her around."

"Nice choice," Thomas remarked with a light smile. Then, leaning against the railing, he got straight to the point. "Nathaniel’s birthday is coming up. I was thinking of arranging something at a countryside resort—great atmosphere, not too far from the city. What do you think?"

He laid out his plans in detail, watching her reaction carefully.

His earnestness made Evelyn feel a flicker of pressure. She kept her tone neutral. "Sounds lovely. I’m sure Nathaniel will appreciate it."

"Since you agree, I’ll go ahead with the arrangements. If you have any suggestions, just let me know. I figured I’d handle it this year since you’re both busy, and I’ve had some free time lately."

Evelyn nodded politely.

Then Thomas studied her, his expression turning serious. "Evelyn… you’ll be there, won’t you?"

She froze, meeting his gaze. "I…"

The truth was, given the current state of her relationship with Nathaniel, she wasn’t sure if her presence would be appropriate.

Still, she had already prepared a gift—one that might mark their last birthday together as a couple.

She had assumed Nathaniel would keep it low-key, perhaps just a family dinner at the Martin estate. With Edward, Richard, and Victoria around, it wouldn’t feel awkward. The gift would just be… a gesture. Nothing more.

But now Thomas was suggesting a resort getaway. Logically, as his wife, she should attend. But…

Evelyn bit her lip lightly before asking, "Would it make things uncomfortable if I went?"
###Chapter 178

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, blinking against the soft light. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady and deep. She studied his profile—the strong jawline, the faint stubble, the way his dark lashes rested against his cheeks.

A small smile tugged at her lips.

Then her phone buzzed.

Evelyn reached for it, careful not to disturb Nathaniel. The screen displayed a message from Gregory:

"We have a problem. The client wants major revisions—by Monday."

Her stomach dropped.

She had spent weeks perfecting those blueprints. The project was supposed to be straightforward, but now, with the client suddenly demanding changes, everything was thrown into chaos.

Nathaniel shifted beside her, his arm sliding around her waist. "Morning," he murmured, voice rough with sleep.

Evelyn exhaled. "Morning."

He cracked an eye open, sensing her tension. "What's wrong?"

She showed him the message.

Nathaniel frowned, sitting up. "That’s ridiculous. They approved the initial drafts."

"I know." Evelyn rubbed her temples. "But if I don’t fix this, we could lose the contract."

His jaw tightened. "Let me handle it."

She shook her head. "No. This is my project. I’ll deal with it."

Nathaniel studied her for a long moment before nodding. "Fine. But if they give you any more trouble, I’m stepping in."

Evelyn leaned over, pressing a quick kiss to his lips. "Deal."

She slipped out of bed, already mentally rearranging her weekend plans. Coffee. Laptop. Hours of revisions.

As she headed for the shower, her phone buzzed again.

This time, it was Isabella.

"We need to talk."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her phone.

Isabella never reached out unless it was important.

Or dangerous.

She glanced back at Nathaniel, who was now scrolling through his own messages, oblivious.

Evelyn typed a quick reply:

"About what?"

The response came instantly.

"Nathaniel."

Her pulse spiked.

Whatever Isabella wanted, it wasn’t good.

And Evelyn had a sinking feeling this weekend was about to get a lot more complicated.

"Just a small gathering with close friends," Thomas explained, leaning casually against the marble pillar. "You know Nathaniel despises crowded events. Too much noise irritates him, so we're keeping it under ten people."

"I see."

"You must come, Evelyn. It's Nathaniel's birthday after all." Thomas's voice dropped to a pleading tone. "I've never begged you for anything before. Consider this my first and only request."

After persistent persuasion, Evelyn finally relented.

They were married, after all. How absurd would it appear if she refused to attend her own husband's birthday celebration?

Seeing Evelyn's nod, Thomas broke into a wide grin. "Perfect! We'll leave a day early then. Let's exchange contacts so I can update you with details."

They swapped WhatsApp information before Evelyn walked away.

Thomas remained motionless, watching until Evelyn's silhouette vanished around the corner. Only then did he retrieve his phone and dial a familiar number.

The call connected instantly. "What is it?" came the familiar deep voice, laced with indifference.

"Must you always sound so cold with me?"

"I'll hang up."

"Wait!" Thomas chuckled. "Guess who I just met?"

Silence. Nathaniel had never entertained guessing games.

"Get to the point."

Sensing his friend's impatience, Thomas abandoned the teasing. "I just spoke with Evelyn. Told her about your birthday plans."

"And?"

Nathaniel's immediate response made Thomas grin. "Oh? Suddenly interested?"

"Meet me for drinks."

"Now you're eager?" Thomas laughed but agreed to meet at their usual clubhouse.

Over whiskey, Thomas recounted Evelyn's reaction - how she'd agreed to attend the birthday celebration. Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable, though Thomas swore he caught the ghost of a smile before it vanished.

"Don't you have anything to say?" Thomas prodded.

"Thomas," Nathaniel swirled his drink, "need I remind you? Evelyn is my wife. Her presence at my birthday is expected, not extraordinary."

Something felt off about Nathaniel's response, but Thomas couldn't pinpoint what.

Then came the warning. "Since you're organizing this, ensure it's flawless. If this year's celebration disappoints like last year's, consider your position in Mayby terminated."

"Too late to back out now?"

Nathaniel's icy stare answered that question.

Clinking glasses, Thomas casually added, "Evelyn mentioned dining at Scarlett's with a friend earlier. Do you know who it was? Male or female?"

"Since when do you care about her dining companions?"

"Just looking out for you, mate. Wouldn't want any... marital complications."

"Unnecessary."

The drinking session ended at eleven. Samuel arrived to chauffeur Nathaniel back to Pineview Villa.

During the drive, Samuel volunteered his report. "Mr. Martin, I've completed the background check on Charlotte Bennett as requested."

"Proceed."

Nathaniel leaned back, eyes closed.

"Charlotte originates from Dattlech. She attended the same high school as Mrs. Martin. Their similar family circumstances fostered a close friendship. Additionally, Charlotte is the adopted daughter of the Prescott family in Dattlech - making her the adopted sister of Alexander Prescott, current heir to the Prescott empire."

"Alexander's adopted sister?"

"Correct."

"Any public knowledge of this?"

"The Prescotts keep Charlotte's identity concealed. This information came from household staff. Rumor suggests Alexander's relationship with Charlotte extends beyond sibling bonds. Despite being engaged, he maintains strict control over Charlotte's interactions, particularly with men."

"Is that so?" Nathaniel's eyes narrowed, shadows deepening in their depths. "What do the Prescotts know about Evelyn's connection to Charlotte?"
###Chapter 179

The tension in the room was suffocating. Evelyn clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms as she faced Nathaniel. His stormy gray eyes held a coldness she hadn’t seen in months.

"You knew," she whispered, her voice trembling. "All this time, you knew."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "It wasn’t that simple, Evelyn."

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "Of course it wasn’t. Nothing ever is with you."

The revelation had shattered her. Isabella’s sudden reappearance wasn’t a coincidence—it was orchestrated. And Nathaniel had been aware of it. The betrayal cut deeper than she expected.

Across the room, Gregory cleared his throat. "Evelyn, maybe we should—"

"No." She held up a hand, silencing him. "I need answers. Now."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "Fine. But not here."

He reached for her arm, but she jerked away. "Don’t touch me."

The pain in his eyes was fleeting, quickly replaced by frustration. "Then where?"

Evelyn hesitated. The penthouse, their home, no longer felt safe. Every corner held memories now tainted by lies.

"Somewhere neutral," she finally said. "The café by the river."

Nathaniel nodded curtly. "One hour."

As he strode out, the door slammed behind him, the sound echoing through the silent room. Evelyn sank into a chair, her legs suddenly weak.

Gregory approached cautiously. "You okay?"

She shook her head. "No. But I will be."

Her phone buzzed—a message from Caroline. Call me when you can. It’s urgent.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. What now?

She glanced at the clock. Fifty-five minutes until she faced Nathaniel again. Fifty-five minutes to gather the strength to hear the truth—no matter how much it hurt.

The game had changed. And this time, she wouldn’t let him dictate the rules.

Nathaniel's response was measured. "Alexander is aware of the situation. Given his prior interactions with Mrs. Bennett, he has no objections to Charlotte maintaining a friendship with her."

"Since when does he have a say in this?" Isabella's gaze turned icy as she glared at Samuel, her displeasure evident.

Samuel quickly corrected himself. "My apologies. That was poorly phrased."

"Enough. Focus on monitoring Charlotte and Evelyn for now. If Evelyn dares to drag Charlotte into her mess, find a way to notify the Prescott family to retrieve her immediately."

"Understood, sir."

Samuel gave a curt nod.

The night passed uneventfully, but by morning, Isabella was on the phone with Nathaniel again.

Her voice trembled with feigned distress. "Nathaniel, the hospital results came back. My mother’s condition is worse than we thought. The doctors are recommending a heart transplant. Without it, she’ll only deteriorate further."

Her choked sobs made Nathaniel’s jaw tighten slightly. His reply was detached. "If the doctors recommend a transplant, then proceed with it."

"You’re right. But, Nathaniel, I’m unfamiliar with the hospital procedures, and there’s so much to arrange. I hate to ask, but… could you help me?"

"Samuel will handle anything the hospital requires. The Martin Group has critical projects underway, so I won’t be available in person. Is that acceptable?"

Isabella forced a smile into her voice. "Of course, work comes first. I’ll coordinate with Samuel if anything arises. But…"

"But?"

"My mother has been asking for you. She’s frightened—being in the hospital at her age is unsettling. She’d feel so much better if she could see you. Nathaniel, if you have even a moment to spare, could you visit?"

Silence stretched between them.

Finally, Nathaniel’s voice, cool and unreadable, broke it. "If time permits, I’ll stop by."

"Thank you! She’ll be overjoyed. I truly appreciate this, Nathaniel."

"Don’t mention it."

His tone remained indifferent, his expression unreadable. Only after ending the call did he set his phone down, his sharp features hardening with quiet suspicion.

Back at the hospital, Isabella slipped her phone into her pocket and returned to the private ward. Samuel had just completed the admission paperwork and entered with a respectful nod.

"Ms. Davis, I’ve contacted the specialists. We’ll proceed with the transplant as soon as a donor match is confirmed."

Isabella’s response was flat. "Fine."

Samuel’s brow furrowed slightly, but he maintained his professionalism. Turning to Sean and Wanda, he added, "Please rest for now. Lunch has been arranged and will arrive shortly."

Wanda offered a frail smile. "Thank you."

"It’s my duty." Samuel then addressed Isabella. "If there’s nothing else, I’ll return to the office."

"Wait." Isabella’s voice was sharp. "Find someone to keep my mother company—she needs distraction. And since Nathaniel instructed me to go through you, tell me… has he been truly occupied with work lately?"

The implication was clear.

Samuel met her gaze evenly. "Ms. Davis, Mr. Martin’s schedule is confidential. I’m not at liberty to disclose it."

Isabella’s lips curled into a cold smirk. "Samuel, must you be so difficult? Once I marry Nathaniel, your position will depend on my goodwill. Wouldn’t it be wiser to start proving your loyalty now?"

Her threat hung in the air, unsubtle and venomous.



###Chapter 180

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Pineview Villa, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. Evelyn stood by the window, her fingers tracing the delicate rim of her coffee cup. The warmth seeped into her skin, but it did little to ease the tension coiling in her chest.

Nathaniel had left early—again.

She exhaled sharply, setting the cup down with a quiet clink. The silence of the villa was suffocating. Even Alfred, ever the discreet presence, seemed to tread more lightly these days.

Her phone buzzed on the counter. A message from Gregory.

"Evelyn, the client wants revisions by noon. They’re pushing the deadline."

She groaned, rubbing her temples. The Holloway project was supposed to be straightforward, but the investors kept changing their minds. She typed back a quick response before tossing her phone onto the couch.

A knock at the door startled her.

"Come in," she called, smoothing her blouse.

Alfred stepped inside, his expression unreadable. "Miss Evelyn, you have a visitor."

She frowned. "Who is it?"

Before he could answer, the door swung open wider, and Isabella strode in, her designer heels clicking against the hardwood.

Evelyn’s spine stiffened. "Isabella."

The woman smiled, though it didn’t reach her eyes. "Evelyn. It’s been a while."

Too long, Evelyn thought bitterly.

Isabella’s gaze swept the room, taking in the lavish decor before settling back on Evelyn. "I was in the neighborhood and thought I’d drop by. Nathaniel mentioned you’ve been… busy."

The implication was clear.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "He talks about me?"

Isabella’s lips curved. "Oh, darling, we talk about everything."

The words were a knife, twisting just enough to draw blood.

Alfred cleared his throat. "Shall I prepare tea, Miss Evelyn?"

"No," Evelyn said, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. "We won’t be long."

Isabella’s smirk widened. "Such a gracious host."

Evelyn stepped forward, her voice dropping to a whisper. "What do you want?"

Isabella tilted her head, feigning innocence. "Can’t an old friend check in?"

"Cut the act," Evelyn snapped.

For a moment, silence stretched between them. Then Isabella sighed, her facade slipping. "Fine. I need Nathaniel’s help with something. A… personal matter."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. "And you came to me?"

Isabella’s eyes gleamed. "I thought you’d appreciate the heads-up."

The doorbell rang again, sharp and insistent.

Alfred excused himself, but Evelyn barely registered his departure. Her mind raced.

Isabella leaned in, her perfume cloying. "Tell him I’ll be waiting at the usual place."

Then she turned on her heel and left, leaving Evelyn standing there, fists clenched.

The usual place.

As if they still had one.

Evelyn’s phone buzzed once more. This time, it was Nathaniel.

"We need to talk."

She stared at the message, her stomach twisting.

Something was coming.

And she wasn’t sure she was ready for it.

Nathaniel's secretary, Samuel Yates, maintained his usual composed demeanor despite Isabella's cold reception. "Ms. Davis, I appreciate your concern. However, company matters are confidential, and my current priority is overseeing your mother's surgery arrangements. Mr. Martin has delegated his responsibilities elsewhere, so I must respectfully decline your offer."

Isabella's lips thinned in displeasure, but she held her tongue.

Samuel stepped out of the hospital room just as a nurse approached with test results. After a brief exchange about Wanda's condition—stable for now, but precarious if complications arose—he turned back to deliver the update. Though Isabella's hostility was palpable, professionalism demanded he set personal feelings aside.

His knuckles hovered over the door when Wanda's voice drifted through. "Isabella, we’re so grateful. Without you, I don’t know what we would’ve done."

"Enough. Focus on recovering." Isabella’s reply was clipped.

Wanda pressed on, undeterred. "But I need to say this—you may not be our blood, but you’ve been a blessing as our daughter."

"Drop it." Isabella’s tone turned icy, silencing Wanda instantly.

Samuel’s hand stilled. A flicker of disdain crossed his features before he pocketed the test results and strode away without entering.

Back at Martin Group headquarters, he headed straight for Nathaniel’s office. After routine updates, he relayed the hospital revelation. "Sir, Ms. Davis isn’t her parents’ biological child. She seemed... resistant to the topic."

Nathaniel’s gaze sharpened. "You’re certain?"

"Positive. Wanda confirmed it herself."

The CEO’s expression darkened. With a dismissive wave, he signaled Samuel to leave, then lit a cigarette. Smoke curled around him, obscuring the storm in his cobalt eyes.

He wouldn’t confront Isabella—not yet. But that didn’t mean inaction.

By evening, Samuel had discreetly launched an investigation: When had Isabella entered the Davis family? Who were her real parents?

If she’s a public figure, tracing her roots should be simple, Nathaniel mused. So why hasn’t she? The question coiled in his mind, thickening the shadows in his stare.

Meanwhile, Evelyn hadn’t spoken to Nathaniel since their strained car encounter days prior. He’d texted; she’d deleted it unread.

Charlotte arched a brow at her friend’s uncharacteristic irritation. "What did Nathaniel do to you in that car?"



###Chapter 181

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand ballroom, she felt the weight of countless eyes on her. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the elite crowd, their whispers sharp enough to cut through the air. She tightened her grip on Nathaniel's arm, grounding herself in his presence.

"Relax," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear. "They're just curious."

She forced a smile, but her pulse betrayed her. This wasn't just any event—it was the annual Martin Charity Gala, and for the first time, she wasn't attending as an outsider. She was Nathaniel Martin's wife.

Across the room, Isabella Davis stood with her entourage, her crimson gown a deliberate contrast to Evelyn's understated elegance. Their gazes locked, and Evelyn didn't miss the challenge in Isabella's smirk.

"Don't let her get to you," Caroline whispered, appearing at Evelyn's side with a glass of champagne. "She's just bitter."

Evelyn exhaled. "I know. But she knows exactly how to push my buttons."

Before Caroline could reply, Edward Martin approached, his cane tapping against the marble floor. "Evelyn," he greeted warmly. "I trust you're settling in well?"

She nodded. "Yes, thank you."

His sharp eyes flickered toward Isabella. "Ignore the distractions. Tonight is about the foundation."

Nathaniel squeezed her hand. "We should greet the guests."

As they moved through the crowd, Evelyn caught snippets of conversation—some admiring, others skeptical. A woman in a silver dress leaned toward her companion. "Do you think she's really cut out for this life?"

Evelyn's jaw clenched, but Nathaniel's fingers brushed the small of her back, steadying her.

Then, the music shifted. The crowd parted as Sebastian Wilson, Summit Realty's CEO, strode toward them with Jonathan Blake in tow.

"Martin," Sebastian said, extending a hand. "Impressive turnout."

Nathaniel shook it. "Glad you could make it."

Sebastian's gaze slid to Evelyn. "And the lovely Mrs. Martin. I hear your latest project is causing quite a stir."

She smiled politely. "We aim to innovate."

Jonathan cleared his throat. "Actually, we were hoping to discuss a potential collaboration."

Before Evelyn could respond, a crash echoed from the buffet table. Rosalind, the new chef, stood frozen as a tower of champagne glasses shattered at her feet.

Murmurs erupted.

Nathaniel sighed. "Excuse us."

As they moved to handle the commotion, Evelyn caught Isabella's smirk widening.

This night was far from over.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, hesitating before she spoke. "I'd rather not say. It might... taint your ears."

Charlotte blinked, then smirked. "Evelyn, don’t tell me you two had sex in the car?"

Evelyn’s expression stiffened. "Don’t be ridiculous."

"Ridiculous? Then why won’t you tell me?"

"Keep talking like that, and you’ll be sleeping on the balcony tonight."

"Evelyn, are you blushing? Trying to silence the only witness?"

Evelyn shot her a look, deciding explanations were pointless. Instead, she said coolly, "I just wanted to remind you—don’t influence my baby."

Charlotte finally dropped the subject.

They had a simple dinner at home, but Charlotte woke up starving in the middle of the night. Knowing Evelyn was pregnant, she didn’t ask her to cook. And since she couldn’t cook herself, she ordered takeout.

What should’ve been a harmless late-night snack turned into a disaster. Before dawn, she was curled up in the hospital with gastroenteritis, her face pale with pain.

Evelyn sighed, watching her wince. "This is what happens when you sneak junk food. Don’t ever do this again."

Charlotte groaned. "Stop lecturing me. I’ve suffered enough—spare me."

Despite her scolding, Evelyn took care of her. The emergency room was packed, so they had to sit in the hallway for the IV.

By morning, Charlotte was finally admitted. After settling her in the ward, Evelyn went to collect the prescribed medication.

Exhausted from the sleepless night, she yawned as she headed to the payment counter, barely registering the figures approaching her.

"Evelyn? Are you unwell?" Isabella’s soft voice cut through her fatigue.

Evelyn looked up to see Nathaniel and Isabella just steps away. Nathaniel wore a tailored black suit under a sleek trench coat, his sharp features softened slightly by the hospital’s fluorescent lights. Beside him, Isabella smiled politely.

Evelyn’s gaze flickered between them before landing on Nathaniel.

He frowned. "What’s wrong? Are you sick?"

"Not me. Charlotte’s stomach is acting up." She glanced at the payment line. "I’m just getting her meds."

She moved to leave, but Nathaniel caught her wrist.

Evelyn tensed. "Nathaniel?"

His grip tightened slightly, sensing her withdrawal. His voice, though low, carried an edge. "I’ll have Samuel help you."

"That’s unnecessary. I can manage."

"Evelyn." His tone darkened.

She exhaled, pulling her hand free. "She’s fine. The doctor just wants to observe her for a day."

Without waiting for a response, she turned and joined the queue, feeling his gaze burning into her back.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened, irritation flashing across his face.

Isabella touched his arm gently. "Is she upset because of me?"

He didn’t answer, his expression grim.

"Go after her," Isabella urged. "I’ll wait with my mother. The doctor won’t be here for a while anyway."



###Chapter 182

The moment Nathaniel stepped into the room, Evelyn felt the air shift. His presence was magnetic, commanding attention without a single word. She had spent the entire morning preparing for this meeting, yet now, under his piercing gaze, her carefully rehearsed speech evaporated.

"Evelyn," he said, his voice low and smooth, like dark velvet. "You look stunning."

She swallowed hard, forcing a smile. "Thank you. You’re not so bad yourself."

A smirk tugged at his lips. "Flattery won’t get you out of this conversation."

She exhaled sharply. "I wasn’t trying to."

Nathaniel took a step closer, his eyes never leaving hers. "Good. Because we need to talk about what happened last night."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. The memory of their heated argument—words thrown like daggers, accusations that cut deep—flashed through her mind. She had stormed out, slamming the door behind her, leaving him standing alone in the dimly lit study.

"I thought we agreed to leave it in the past," she said carefully.

His jaw tightened. "Some things can’t be ignored, Evelyn. Not when they involve her."

Isabella.

The name hung between them like a storm cloud. Evelyn clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms. She had hoped they could move past this, but Nathaniel’s stubbornness was legendary.

"Fine," she snapped. "What do you want me to say? That I’m sorry? That I regret standing up for myself?"

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "I want you to understand why I did what I did."

Evelyn scoffed. "Oh, I understand perfectly. You chose her over me—again."

"That’s not true."

"Isn’t it?" She crossed her arms. "Then explain why you met with her behind my back."

A tense silence stretched between them. Outside, the distant hum of the city seemed to fade, leaving only the sound of their ragged breaths.

Finally, Nathaniel sighed. "It wasn’t what you think."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Then enlighten me."

Before he could respond, the door burst open.

"Mr. Martin!" Samuel Yates, Nathaniel’s secretary, rushed in, his face pale. "There’s been an incident at the construction site. The police are involved."

Nathaniel’s demeanor shifted instantly, his concern for Evelyn momentarily forgotten. "What happened?"

Samuel hesitated, glancing at Evelyn before answering. "There’s been an accident. Someone was hurt."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. "Who?"

Samuel swallowed hard. "Gregory Wilson."

Her blood ran cold. Frank.

Without another word, she turned and ran.

Nathaniel called after her, but she didn’t stop. She couldn’t.

Because if something had happened to Gregory, nothing else mattered.

Not their fight.

Not Isabella.

Nothing.

Nathaniel's gaze shifted away from Evelyn. He glanced at Isabella and said curtly, "No, let's go."

Isabella nodded, a faint smirk playing on her lips the moment Nathaniel turned away.

He escorted her to Wanda's private ward, where the older woman immediately brightened at the sight of him. "Nathaniel, thank you! This place is so luxurious—it must cost a fortune per night!" she gushed, clutching the silk sheets.

Isabella's expression darkened, shooting her mother a warning look, but Wanda was too absorbed in Nathaniel's presence to notice.

Worried he might take offense, Isabella quickly interjected, "Nathaniel, Mom doesn’t mean anything by it. She’s just grateful. She’s not very... refined with her words."

"Wanda, focus on recovering," Nathaniel cut in, his tone detached. "Modern medicine can handle your condition. Money isn’t an issue."

His dismissive response made Isabella tense, her fingers tightening around her purse strap.

Wanda, however, beamed even brighter. "Oh, Nathaniel, you’re too kind!" She hesitated before blurting out, "You and Isabella have been together for years now. When are you two planning for children?"

The air turned frigid.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened, a frosty glint in his eyes. He remained silent, his expression unreadable.

Isabella held her breath, waiting.

Seconds stretched unbearably.

Finally, she forced a laugh. "Mom, stop. You’re exhausted—rest now. Nathaniel has work." She shot Wanda a sharp look before turning to him. "I’ll walk you out."

Wanda backtracked hastily. "Oh, Nathaniel, I didn’t mean to pressure you! I just worry about Isabella—"

"Rest well," Nathaniel interrupted coldly. Without another word, he strode out.

Isabella hurried after him, leaving Wanda flustered.

Meanwhile, Evelyn returned to Charlotte’s ward after settling the bills. Charlotte was awake, her face pale but alert.

"I’m so sorry for all this trouble," Charlotte murmured weakly. "You should sit. You’re running yourself ragged."

"How are you feeling?" Evelyn asked, smoothing Charlotte’s hair.

"Better. But starving."

Evelyn sighed. "What do you want to eat?"

"Everything?"

"Try again."

"...Soup?" Charlotte pouted, looking pitiful.

Evelyn handed her a glass of water and pills. "Stay put. I’ll get it."

"You’re the best, Evelyn! Love you!"

"Love me? Then stop poisoning yourself." Evelyn pinched Charlotte’s cheek lightly before grabbing her phone and heading out.

The hospital cafeteria was on the VIP floor. As Evelyn stepped off the elevator, she froze.

Isabella’s voice drifted down the hall, honeyed and pleading.

"Nathaniel, please don’t mind my mother. She’s just protective. In her eyes, you’re already my husband—that’s why she asked. Don’t be angry, okay?"

Evelyn’s grip on her phone tightened.



###Chapter 183

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort in the Maldives. The design was ambitious, but she thrived on challenges.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Ms. Mitchell, Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn straightened, smoothing her blouse. "Send him in."

Gregory Wilson strode in, his usual confident demeanor slightly off. His tie was loosened, and there was a tension in his jaw she hadn’t seen before.

"You look like you’ve had a rough morning," she remarked, gesturing to the chair opposite her.

Gregory exhaled sharply as he sat. "We have a problem. The investors for the Maldives project are pulling out."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. "What? Why?"

"Rumors," he muttered, rubbing his temples. "Someone’s been whispering that our designs are structurally unsound. It’s nonsense, but they’re spooked."

Her mind raced. This project was crucial—not just for her firm, but for her reputation. "Who would spread something like that?"

Gregory hesitated. "I don’t have proof, but… I heard Isabella Davis was seen having lunch with Jonathan Blake last week."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her pen. Isabella. Nathaniel’s ex. The woman who had made it her mission to undermine Evelyn at every turn.

"This isn’t just business," Evelyn said quietly. "This is personal."

Gregory nodded grimly. "What do you want to do?"

Evelyn stood, her resolve hardening. "First, we counter the rumors. Get Dr. Harrison to review the blueprints and issue a statement. Then—" She paused, a cold smile forming. "I think it’s time I paid Isabella a visit."

Gregory raised a brow. "You sure that’s wise?"

"No," Evelyn admitted. "But I’m done playing nice."

As Gregory left, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel:

Dinner tonight? I have something to tell you.

Her heart skipped. Something in his tone felt… off.

She typed back quickly. Of course. Everything okay?

His reply was delayed. Then: We’ll talk tonight.

Evelyn stared at the screen, unease curling in her chest. Whatever Nathaniel had to say, she had a feeling it wouldn’t be good.

And with Isabella stirring trouble, the timing couldn’t be worse.

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat as she watched the scene unfold before her. Isabella stood before Nathaniel, her delicate frame trembling, tears glistening in her doe-like eyes. The sterile white lights of the hospital corridor cast sharp shadows, making Nathaniel's chiseled features appear even more unreadable.

He stood with one hand casually tucked into his pocket, his gaze steady as it lingered on Isabella. When he finally spoke, his voice was cool, detached. "I don't care what she says. But you know exactly where we stand, Isabella."

The words struck Evelyn like a physical blow. She froze, her fingers curling into fists at her sides.

Isabella's lips quivered. "Nathaniel, you promised me. You said you would marry me. Are you taking it back now?"

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, his jaw tightening. "Is this really the time?"

"I need to know!" Isabella's voice cracked. "Is it because of Evelyn? Tell me the truth—do you love her?"

Evelyn's pulse roared in her ears. She shouldn’t be listening, yet she couldn’t move.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "This has nothing to do with her."

"Liar!" Isabella’s voice rose, desperation lacing every word. "You’re only staying with her because of the baby, aren’t you? Once she gives you an heir, you’ll leave her. That’s the plan, isn’t it?"

Silence.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. The lack of denial was answer enough.

A bitter laugh threatened to escape her lips. So that was it. She was nothing more than a means to an end—a vessel for the Martin heir.

Isabella’s tear-filled eyes searched Nathaniel’s face, but he remained impassive.

Then, the elevator dinged, shattering the tension.

"Excuse me, where’s the cafeteria?" A nurse’s voice cut through the stillness.

Nathaniel and Isabella stepped apart, their gazes flickering toward Evelyn, who stood motionless.

For a heartbeat, no one moved.

Then Evelyn snapped back to reality. Without a word, she turned and stabbed the elevator button, her movements sharp, mechanical. The doors slid open instantly, and she stepped inside, pressing the button for Charlotte’s floor with numb fingers.

As the doors closed, she finally let out the breath she’d been holding.

Her reflection in the polished metal stared back at her—hollow-eyed, lips pressed into a thin line.

So this is what it feels like to be disposable.



###Chapter 184

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort that could redefine Martin Group's portfolio. The weight of responsibility settled on her shoulders, but she welcomed it.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Evelyn?" Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn straightened, smoothing her blouse. "Send him in."

Gregory Wilson strode in, his usual confident demeanor laced with something unreadable. He dropped a file onto her desk. "We have a problem."

She flipped it open, scanning the contents. Her stomach twisted. "This can't be right. The zoning permits were approved weeks ago."

"Apparently, Summit Realty filed an objection," Gregory said grimly. "Sebastian Wilson is pulling strings."

Evelyn's jaw tightened. Sebastian had been a thorn in her side since the beginning. "We need to act fast. If this delays construction, Nathaniel will—"

"Already knows," a deep voice cut in.

She turned to see Nathaniel leaning against the doorframe, his expression unreadable. The air between them crackled with tension.

Gregory cleared his throat. "I'll leave you two to discuss." He slipped out, closing the door behind him.

Evelyn exhaled. "How much did you hear?"

"Enough." Nathaniel pushed off the door and approached, his gaze intense. "Why didn't you tell me Summit was causing trouble again?"

"Because I can handle it." She met his stare, refusing to back down.

His lips thinned. "This isn't just about the project, Evelyn. It's about us."

She blinked. "What?"

"You've been shutting me out." His voice softened, but the hurt was unmistakable. "I thought we were partners."

The accusation stung. She looked away, fingers curling into fists. "I didn't want to burden you with more problems."

Nathaniel cupped her chin, forcing her to meet his eyes. "You're never a burden."

Her breath hitched. For a moment, the world narrowed to just them. Then her phone buzzed, shattering the moment.

She glanced at the screen—Isabella Davis.

Nathaniel's hand dropped. "You should get that."

Evelyn hesitated, but duty won. She answered. "Isabella?"

"Evelyn," Isabella's voice was sharp. "We need to talk. Alone."

Her pulse quickened. "About what?"

"About the past. And what it means for your future."

The line went dead.

Nathaniel watched her, his expression unreadable. "What did she want?"

Evelyn swallowed. "I don't know. But I think we're about to find out."

The weight of impending chaos settled over them. Whatever Isabella had planned, it wouldn't be good. And this time, Evelyn wasn't sure she could face it alone.

The elevator doors didn't close fast enough. Just as they were about to seal shut, a large hand shot out, blocking them. Nathaniel stepped inside, his imposing frame immediately cornering Evelyn against the wall.

The doors slid closed with a final click, muffling Isabella's distant cry of, "Nathaniel—!"

But Nathaniel wasn't listening. His dark eyes were locked onto Evelyn, his expression unreadable, voice dangerously low. "Evelyn. Why are you running?"

Evelyn met his gaze with equal frost. She pressed herself harder against the elevator wall, as if she could melt into it. Every inch of her screamed to put distance between them.

His jaw tightened at her reaction. "I asked you a question. Are you ignoring me now?"

She pressed her lips together, refusing to look at him. But he was too close—his breath warm against her skin, his presence suffocating. His stare burned through her, making her pulse race uncomfortably.

Evelyn swallowed. "I wasn’t running. And I didn’t mean to eavesdrop. I was just going to the cafeteria for soup. I didn’t expect to walk in on your... intimate conversation with Ms. Davis. If that bothers you, I can apologize."

Her hand instinctively moved to shield her stomach. To Nathaniel, it was a rejection. His eyes darkened, the air between them turning glacial.

In one swift motion, he cupped her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. He leaned in, his breath teasing her lips, making her shiver. "You think that was intimate?"

"Wasn’t it?"

"Are you upset because of what Isabella said?"

"No." Why would I be? Evelyn thought bitterly. I stopped caring long ago.

From the sting of betrayal to the numbness of acceptance—she was past anger now.

Nathaniel scoffed. "You can’t even admit you’re angry. Since when did you become such a coward?"

"I told you—I’m not angry. What right do I have to be? What you do with Isabella is your business. But Nathaniel, let me make one thing clear—even if you promised her I’d bear a child for you to raise, I won’t. I never agreed to that, and I never will."

His frown deepened. "You think this is about her?"

"Isn’t it? Because of you, Isabella can never be a mother. And now, suddenly, you won’t divorce me, you’re forcing me to stay—all for her. You’d give her anything because you love her. But you don’t get to build your happiness on my suffering."

"So that’s why you moved out?"

"This isn’t about the apartment. I left because there’s no point in pretending anymore. We are getting divorced."

Nathaniel’s expression turned thunderous. His grip on her tightened. "Evelyn, the way you talk—it infuriates me. You’re much more tolerable when you’re silent."

Her eyes flashed. She jerked her head away, but he didn’t let her go. Instead, he tilted her face up and crushed his lips against hers in a searing kiss.

###Chapter 185

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden streaks across her blueprints. She tapped her pen against the desk, lost in thought. The Pineview Villa project was nearing completion, but something felt off.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel.

"Dinner tonight? I have something to tell you."

Evelyn's fingers hovered over the screen. His tone was unreadable. Was it good news? Or was this about Isabella again?

She exhaled sharply. Ever since Isabella had reappeared, Nathaniel had been distant. Evelyn had tried to ignore it, but the tension was suffocating.

Her assistant, Gabrielle, knocked lightly on the door. "Evelyn, Gregory is here to see you."

Evelyn straightened. "Send him in."

Gregory strode in, his usual confident demeanor slightly frayed. "We have a problem."

Evelyn's stomach tightened. "What is it?"

"The investors for Pineview are pulling out."

"What?" She shot to her feet. "Why?"

Gregory ran a hand through his hair. "Rumors are circulating. They think the project is cursed after the last accident."

Evelyn clenched her fists. "That’s ridiculous. It was an isolated incident."

Gregory sighed. "I know. But perception is everything. We need to act fast."

Evelyn’s mind raced. If the investors backed out now, the entire project would collapse. And with it, her reputation.

Her phone buzzed again. Another message from Nathaniel.

"It’s important."

Evelyn gritted her teeth. She couldn’t deal with Nathaniel’s cryptic messages right now. Not when her career was on the line.

She grabbed her coat. "I’ll handle the investors. Set up a meeting."

Gregory nodded. "I’ll make the calls."

As Evelyn stormed out of the office, she barely noticed the curious glances from her colleagues. Her mind was a whirlwind of contingency plans.

But beneath the panic, one thought nagged at her.

What did Nathaniel want to tell her?

And why did she have a sinking feeling it would change everything?

Perhaps it had been too long since Nathaniel last touched Evelyn. Their last intimate moment had been that heated kiss in the car, and now, the second his lips met hers again, electricity surged through his veins.

Nathaniel lost control—just for a moment—forgetting they were still in the elevator.

The doors slid open.

A startled gasp echoed from outside. Evelyn jolted, her cheeks flushing crimson as she fisted Nathaniel’s shirt in her hands.

"Nathaniel, you—"

Her reaction was too obvious. Nathaniel noticed, but he didn’t care. His expression remained unreadable, his dark eyes unflinching as they locked onto her.

She was breathtaking like this—flushed, delicate, her tear-brightened eyes shimmering with something that sent a primal thrill through him.

He didn’t pull away.

But with people watching, Evelyn couldn’t take it. She shoved him back, ducked her head, and fled past the stunned onlookers, rushing straight to Charlotte’s hospital room and slamming the door behind her.

Nathaniel watched her go, a faint smirk tugging at his lips before he stepped out of the elevator, his usual composed mask sliding back into place.

Evelyn pressed her back against the closed door, her pulse still racing.

Charlotte blinked up at her from the bed. "What’s wrong? Did you see a ghost?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply, fanning her burning face. "I’ll order takeout."

Charlotte tilted her head. "You’re acting weird. What happened?"

"Nothing."

"Really?"

"Yes."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, mentally cursing Nathaniel.

She didn’t leave the room again until Charlotte was discharged that afternoon.

Samuel arrived just as they were preparing to leave. He bowed slightly. "Mrs. Martin, Ms. Bennett. Mr. Martin sent me to assist you."

"No need," Evelyn said coolly.

Charlotte whispered, "Did Nathaniel figure me out already?"

Evelyn shot her a warning look.

Samuel hesitated. "Mrs. Martin, at least allow me to escort you downstairs."

Evelyn sighed. "Fine."

The three stepped into the elevator. Charlotte, still weak, leaned against Evelyn and murmured, "So that’s why you came back all flustered this morning. You ran into Nathaniel?"

Evelyn stayed silent.

Charlotte grinned. "What did he do to you?"

Evelyn’s jaw tightened.

"Did he kiss you? Your face is still red."

"Charlotte," Evelyn warned, her voice icy.

The elevator fell silent.

Samuel stood rigid at the front, barely breathing. The way Evelyn had just spoken—cold, commanding—sounded exactly like Nathaniel.

Couples really do start to resemble each other, he thought.



###Chapter 186

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. Evelyn stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the silk sheets. Beside her, Nathaniel was already awake, his piercing blue eyes watching her with an intensity that still made her heart skip a beat.

"You're staring," she murmured, a playful smile tugging at her lips.

"Can't help it," he replied, his voice low and rough from sleep. "You're breathtaking."

She rolled her eyes but couldn't suppress the warmth spreading through her chest. Three years of marriage, and he still had the power to make her feel like the most desired woman in the world.

Their peaceful moment was interrupted by the shrill ring of Nathaniel's phone. He groaned, reaching for it on the nightstand. Evelyn caught the name flashing on the screen—Samuel Yates. His secretary.

Nathaniel answered with a clipped, "What?"

Evelyn watched as his expression darkened. His jaw tightened, and his grip on the phone turned white-knuckled. Whatever news Samuel was delivering, it wasn't good.

When he hung up, Nathaniel exhaled sharply, running a hand through his tousled hair. "We have a problem."

Evelyn sat up, the sheets pooling around her waist. "What kind of problem?"

"The kind that involves Isabella Davis."

Her stomach dropped. Isabella—Nathaniel's ex and the woman who had once tried to tear them apart. She hadn't heard that name in months.

"What did she do now?" Evelyn asked, forcing her voice to remain steady.

Nathaniel met her gaze, his eyes stormy. "She's back in the city. And she's not alone."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "Who's with her?"

"Vanessa." Isabella's ruthless agent.

A cold dread settled over Evelyn. Vanessa wasn't just Isabella's manager—she was the mastermind behind every scandal, every carefully orchestrated attack on their relationship. If she was involved, this wasn't just a social call.

Nathaniel's phone buzzed again. This time, it was a message. He glanced at it, then cursed under his breath.

"What?" Evelyn demanded.

He turned the screen toward her. A single photo filled the display—Isabella, standing outside the Martin Group headquarters, a smirk playing on her lips. The caption beneath it sent a chill down Evelyn's spine:

"Miss me?"

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists. "She's not here to reminisce."

Nathaniel's expression hardened. "No. She's here for war."

And just like that, the peace of their morning shattered.

The elevator doors slid open to reveal the dimly lit parking garage. Nathaniel remained close behind Evelyn and Charlotte as they walked toward their cars. Evelyn spun around abruptly when they reached her vehicle. "Mr. Yates, go ahead and deal with whatever Nathaniel needs."

Samuel gave a curt nod but didn’t move. Just then, the door of the sleek black car beside them swung open, and Nathaniel stepped out.

His gaze locked onto Evelyn, intense and unreadable, though his voice remained deceptively calm. "Get in. I’ll drive you home. Samuel can take your car."

Evelyn’s brows knitted together. "That’s unnecessary. I can drive myself."

"Evelyn," Nathaniel said, his tone dropping dangerously low. "Do you honestly think I’ll let you walk away that easily?"

She glared at him, irritation flashing in her eyes. "Nathaniel, how many times do I have to say it? I’m not avoiding you because I’m afraid of trouble—I just don’t want you driving me. Is that clear enough?"

To her frustration, Nathaniel only smirked, his expression shifting into something darkly amused. "Good. At least you’re not completely indifferent."

He seemed inexplicably pleased, ignoring her icy silence as he closed the distance between them. Before she could react, he plucked the keys from her hand and tossed them to Samuel. "Now, are you getting in?"

Evelyn clenched her fists, forcing herself to stay calm for the baby’s sake.

Charlotte, ever the mediator, stepped in smoothly. "Evelyn, since Mr. Martin insists, why not let him? It’s not like he has anything better to do. Besides, you are still married. A husband driving his wife home isn’t exactly scandalous." She shot Evelyn a pointed look before tugging her toward the car.

Charlotte slid into the backseat first, then reached for Evelyn’s hand. "Come on."

But before Evelyn could move, Nathaniel pulled her back and shut the door firmly.

His voice was rough, laced with something possessive. "You’re sitting up front with me."

Evelyn scoffed. "I thought you were just our chauffeur?"

Nathaniel’s smirk deepened. "No. I’m your husband—as Charlotte so helpfully pointed out." Without waiting for a response, he opened the passenger door and all but guided her inside.

The drive was tense, the silence thick between them.

When the car finally rolled to a stop outside her apartment building, Charlotte wasted no time slipping out, leaving them alone.

Evelyn reached for the door handle, but Nathaniel hit the lock before she could escape.

She turned to him, exasperated. "What now?"

"My birthday is in two days," he said, his gaze boring into hers. "Did you get me anything?"

"No," she answered flatly.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Really?"

"It’s just another day. I’m sure Thomas has already planned some extravagant party for you."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "Evelyn, it’s my birthday. You’re telling me you didn’t even consider getting me a gift?"

She exhaled sharply. "What do you want me to say, Nathaniel? Should I lie and pretend I did? Or would you prefer I make something up on the spot?"

His grip on the steering wheel tightened. "You enjoy pissing me off, don’t you?"

"I want to go inside."

Nathaniel ignored her, his voice dropping to a dangerous murmur. "So, are you going to get me something or not?"
###Chapter 187

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn’s office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. She traced her fingers over the intricate lines of her latest design, a luxury resort that had consumed her thoughts for weeks. The project was ambitious, but she thrived under pressure.

A soft knock interrupted her concentration. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in with a hesitant smile. "Evelyn, Mr. Wilson is here to see you. He says it’s urgent."

Evelyn sighed, rolling up the blueprints. Gregory Wilson, her business partner, had a habit of barging in unannounced. "Send him in."

Gregory strode in, his usual confident demeanor replaced by something more agitated. "We have a problem," he said without preamble. "Summit Realty just pulled out of the Lakeside project."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. "What? That was our biggest contract this quarter."

"I know," Gregory ran a hand through his hair. "Sebastian Wilson called me personally. Said they’re shifting focus to another development."

Evelyn clenched her fists. Sebastian Wilson had always been slippery, but this was a direct blow. "Did he give any real reason?"

Gregory shook his head. "Just corporate jargon. But I have a feeling there’s more to it."

Before Evelyn could respond, her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel lit up the screen:

"We need to talk. Dinner tonight?"

Her heart skipped. Things between them had been strained since Isabella’s sudden reappearance. She typed a quick reply:

"Sure. 7 PM at the usual place?"

Gregory raised an eyebrow. "Trouble in paradise?"

Evelyn shot him a glare. "Focus on the crisis at hand. We need to find another investor, fast."

Gregory exhaled. "I’ll reach out to some contacts. But Evelyn… if Summit backed out this abruptly, others might follow."

The weight of his words settled over her. This wasn’t just about one project—it could jeopardize their entire firm.

As Gregory left, Evelyn turned back to her blueprints, but her mind was elsewhere. Between the business turmoil and Nathaniel’s cryptic message, she felt the walls closing in.

Something was coming. And she wasn’t sure she was ready for it.

Evelyn's brows knitted together in frustration, her patience wearing thin.

Nathaniel cast a glance at Charlotte, who stood waiting by the car, before speaking in a tone that was deliberately indifferent. "Do you really expect me to stay silent after what happened in the hospital elevator?"

The hospital elevator?

Heat rushed to Evelyn's cheeks instantly. She glared at him, her displeasure evident. "You're such an asshole."

"So, are you going to prepare a gift for me or not?"

Nathaniel's voice dropped, laced with a husky undertone as he leaned slightly closer, his gaze intense.

"Do you really feel proud of yourself, extorting a gift like this?"

She was beyond exasperated. Is he seriously this shameless over a birthday present?

"Evelyn," he murmured, his lips curving into a smirk. "All you need to do is answer. Whether I feel accomplished or not—do you really care?"

His eyes darkened with unspoken intent, and the space between them seemed to shrink.

Evelyn stiffened, her breath hitching as she instinctively pressed a hand against his chest to keep him at bay. The firmness beneath her palm sent a jolt through her—if she let her guard down even slightly, he would close the distance in an instant.

Then, his voice, low and rough, brushed against her senses. "I get it now. You didn’t want to prepare a gift because what you really wanted was for me to kiss you. Isn’t that right?"

Before she could react, he tilted his head, his lips dangerously close to hers.

Realizing he wasn’t bluffing, Evelyn pushed against him sharply. "I have prepared something!"

Nathaniel paused, amusement flickering in his eyes. "Oh? What is it?"

"Your birthday gift," she gritted out, still bracing against him.

His chest vibrated with quiet laughter. "So you did prepare it beforehand. Not just because I pushed you into admitting it?"

"Yes," she snapped, feeling like a puppet on strings.

Satisfied, Nathaniel straightened, studying her with a smug expression. "Then why keep it a secret?"

Evelyn refused to dignify that with a response. "I'm getting out. Charlotte isn’t feeling well, and she shouldn’t be standing in the cold. If you’re done, unlock the door."

Silence stretched between them.

A few seconds later, the soft click of the car lock disengaging sounded. Without hesitation, Evelyn shoved the door open and stepped out, slamming it shut behind her with enough force to rattle the windows.

The sharp sound perfectly mirrored her stormy mood.

She marched into the apartment, Charlotte trailing behind her. Every line of Evelyn’s posture radiated irritation, yet there was something oddly captivating about her fiery demeanor—enough to make Nathaniel chuckle under his breath.

His mind drifted back to earlier, in the hospital elevator—the way her cheeks had flushed, the way her eyes had darkened under his touch.

Just the memory sent a surge of heat through him. It took considerable effort to rein himself in.

Inside, Evelyn barely spared Charlotte a glance. "I need to cool off. Rest for a bit. I ordered soup for you—it’ll be here soon."

With that, she disappeared into her bedroom, shutting the door firmly behind her.

Charlotte watched her go, lips twitching. Something must have happened in the car. The usually composed Evelyn wouldn’t lose her temper like this otherwise.

Her phone buzzed, snapping her out of her thoughts.

The name on the screen made her expression shift. She answered, her voice carefully neutral. "Hello?"

"When are you coming back?"

"You gave me a week. It’s only been three days."

Alexander’s voice turned icy. "Charlotte, he’s already tracking you. Do you really think you can hide from him outside of Dattlech? Or is this your way of provoking him? Leaving the Jones family has made you bold, hasn’t it?"

Charlotte’s grip tightened on the phone. "If that’s what you want to believe, fine. Maybe I do want him to find me. Maybe I do want to be with him. Happy now?"
###Chapter 188

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, she felt the weight of countless eyes upon her. The air was thick with tension, the kind that made her fingers twitch at her sides. She had known this day would come—the day she would finally confront Isabella Davis, Nathaniel’s infamous ex-lover.

Isabella stood near the marble fireplace, her crimson dress clinging to her curves like liquid silk. A smirk played on her lips as she sipped champagne, her gaze flickering toward Evelyn with deliberate amusement.

"You must be Evelyn," Isabella purred, stepping forward. "I’ve heard so much about you."

Evelyn forced a polite smile, though her pulse quickened. "All good things, I hope."

Isabella’s laugh was light, almost musical. "Oh, darling, that depends on who you ask."

Nathaniel appeared at Evelyn’s side, his hand resting possessively on the small of her back. "Isabella," he greeted coolly. "I didn’t expect to see you here."

"Didn’t you?" Isabella tilted her head, her dark lashes fluttering. "I was invited, after all. Edward insisted."

Evelyn’s grip tightened on her clutch. Of course. Edward Martin, Nathaniel’s grandfather, had always been fond of Isabella. The old man had never hidden his disapproval of Evelyn, no matter how hard she tried to prove herself.

The room buzzed with whispers, the elite of high society watching the exchange like vultures circling prey. Evelyn straightened her spine. She wouldn’t give them the satisfaction of seeing her falter.

"Excuse me," she murmured, stepping away. She needed air.

Outside on the terrace, the cool night breeze kissed her skin. She exhaled slowly, willing her racing heart to calm.

A familiar voice startled her. "Running away already?"

Evelyn turned to see Gregory Wilson, her business partner, leaning against the railing. His expression was unreadable.

"I just needed a moment," she admitted.

Gregory studied her for a long beat before sighing. "Isabella’s always been a viper. Don’t let her get under your skin."

Evelyn scoffed. "Easy for you to say. You’re not the one she’s trying to destroy."

Gregory’s lips quirked. "No, but I know you. And you’re stronger than this."

She wanted to believe him. But as the distant sound of laughter drifted from inside, Evelyn couldn’t shake the feeling that tonight was only the beginning.

And she had no idea what Isabella was truly planning.

"Charlotte!"

Alexander Prescott's voice crackled with fury through the phone. "I'm giving you forty-eight hours to return. Otherwise, I'll come to Mayby myself."

"Go ahead. Unless you're not afraid of Wendy finding out."

"Do you honestly believe Wendy scares me? Do you think I won't set foot in Mayby just because you're using her as leverage?"

"I know you're not afraid of Wendy," Charlotte replied coolly. "But you are afraid of the Stanleys."

Silence. Then the line went dead.

She could practically feel his rage radiating through the phone.

Sinking onto the sofa, Charlotte exhaled sharply. The usual spark in her bright eyes had dimmed, replaced by a dull exhaustion. Her lips, usually curved in mischief, were pressed into a thin line.

Yet she didn’t regret her words. Hope was a dangerous thing—especially for something that was never meant to be hers.

Two days later.
October 17th.

Sunlight streamed through the curtains, painting golden stripes across the floor.

Nathaniel Martin’s birthday had arrived.

Evelyn was jolted awake by her ringing phone. Thomas Ellsworth’s cheerful voice greeted her. "Evelyn! I’m on my way to pick you up. Ready?"

"Mm."

She hung up, stretching lazily before rolling out of bed.

The night before, she’d told Charlotte about the trip—a birthday celebration at a secluded resort. She’d even extended an invitation, but Charlotte had declined with a vague excuse. Evelyn hadn’t pushed.

After a quick shower, she dressed in a breezy sundress just as Thomas pulled up.

Sliding into the passenger seat, Evelyn spotted Theodore Gene in the back. She recognized him instantly—the man Edward Martin had once tried to set her up with.

Theodore grinned. "Well, well. The infamous rumored girlfriend."

Evelyn smirked. "Funny. I’ve heard your name more than I’ve actually seen you."

They shared a laugh.

Thomas, ever the curious one, leaned in. "Rumored girlfriend? What’s this about?"

"Wouldn’t you like to know?" Theodore teased.

"Come on, we’re friends! I won’t tell Nathaniel."

"He already knows."

Thomas’s eyebrows shot up. Theodore chuckled before elaborating, "Edward wanted me to marry Evelyn."

A beat of silence. Then Thomas snorted. "Nathaniel would murder you."

The car ride was filled with easy banter. Despite barely knowing them, Evelyn felt oddly at ease—no tension, no pretense.

An hour later, they arrived at the resort.

Felix was already there, flanked by two women—one a striking model with legs for days, the other a bubbly brunette. Staff ushered them to a private villa where an elaborate barbecue setup awaited. Later, there’d be a bonfire under the stars.

They’d barely settled in when tires crunched on gravel outside.

Felix whistled. "That’s gotta be Nathaniel."

The door swung open.

"Happy birthday, man!" Thomas clapped Nathaniel on the back. "You’re late, but we’ll let it slide since it’s your day."

Before Nathaniel could reply, Isabella Davis stepped out from behind him.

Dressed in a flowing white gown, she offered a demure smile. "Sorry for the delay, everyone. It’s my fault Nathaniel’s late."

A hush fell. Eyes flicked to Evelyn, but her expression remained unreadable.

Isabella feigned surprise. "Oh! Evelyn, you’re here too. I didn’t think you’d come."

Evelyn’s gaze sharpened. "Is that a problem?"



###Chapter 189

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her blueprints. She tapped her pen absently against the desk, her mind elsewhere. Nathaniel had been distant lately—ever since that charity gala where Isabella had made her grand reappearance.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Gregory.

"Meeting in 10. Summit Realty’s reps are here early."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Right. The new project. She hadn’t even had coffee yet.

Downstairs, the conference room was already half-full. Sebastian Wilson, Summit Realty’s CEO, stood near the window, his sharp suit and sharper smile exuding confidence. Beside him, Jonathan Blake, their lead project manager, was flipping through documents.

Gregory shot her a look—you’re late—but she ignored it.

"Apologies," Evelyn said smoothly, taking her seat. "Traffic was unexpected."

Sebastian smirked. "No worries. We were just discussing the waterfront property."

She forced a smile. This deal was crucial. If they secured it, her firm’s reputation would skyrocket. But something about Sebastian’s gaze unsettled her. Too calculating.

The meeting dragged. Proposals. Budgets. Timelines. Evelyn’s phone vibrated again—Nathaniel.

"Dinner tonight?"

Her chest tightened. They hadn’t spoken properly in days.

Before she could reply, Jonathan slid a folder toward her. "We’d like your team to handle the structural redesign."

Gregory’s eyes lit up, but Evelyn hesitated. Something felt off.

Then Sebastian leaned forward. "There’s one condition."

Silence.

"We want Nathaniel Martin’s endorsement."

Evelyn’s grip on her pen tightened. Of course. It always circled back to Nathaniel.

She met Sebastian’s gaze evenly. "I’ll consider it."

But as she left the room, her mind raced. Was this about business—or was Isabella pulling strings behind the scenes?

Her phone buzzed once more. Unknown number.

"You should ask Nathaniel about Paris."

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Paris?

What the hell had happened in Paris?

Evelyn's sharp remark instantly froze the cheerful atmosphere. The room fell into an uncomfortable silence as all eyes turned toward Nathaniel.

One of the men cleared his throat. "Nathaniel, it's still early. How about a round of poker?" he suggested, attempting to diffuse the tension.

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable as he moved to join them.

Just then, Isabella burst into tears. "I'm so sorry, Nathaniel," she sniffled, her voice trembling. "This is supposed to be your special day, and I've ruined it. I only meant to greet Evelyn warmly. I never imagined my words would upset her..."

The men exchanged uneasy glances while the women shifted uncomfortably in their seats.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened slightly, while Evelyn remained perfectly composed, her phone in hand.

Isabella continued dramatically, "Evelyn, if you're angry because Nathaniel arrived with me, I'll apologize properly. But please don't take it out on him. If my presence bothers you, I can leave immediately."

Theodore was the first to break the awkward silence. "Come now, Isabella," he said with forced cheerfulness. "This is just a friendly gathering. No need for such dramatics."

"Exactly," Felix chimed in. "We're all friends here. Let's not overcomplicate things."

Thomas sprang into action, guiding Nathaniel toward the sofa. "Sit down, both of you," he said firmly. "Evelyn didn't say anything offensive. You're reading too much into this, Isabella. Now let's enjoy Nathaniel's birthday properly."

Flushing with embarrassment, Isabella reluctantly took a seat near Nathaniel, casting a challenging glance at Evelyn.

Evelyn ignored her completely, focusing on her phone as she texted Charlotte: [Did you eat breakfast?]

The reply came instantly: [No appetite without you here. Don't worry about me though. Focus on celebrating Nathaniel's birthday. He's clearly your priority now.]

[Exactly right. He is my husband after all. You're just an outsider now,] Evelyn fired back.

Charlotte's response was immediate: [That's cruel! And to think I just recovered from pneumonia!]

[Pneumonia caused by eating ice cream at 2 AM,] Evelyn countered dryly.

After a pause, Charlotte sent a sad face emoji, prompting Evelyn to soften: [Take care of yourself. No midnight snacks unless you want another hospital visit.]

[Are you staying out tonight?] Charlotte asked.

[Probably,] Evelyn replied. Given Thomas's elaborate party plans that would likely stretch into the early hours, she suspected this was his attempt to reconcile her with Nathaniel. They'd probably be staying overnight.

Charlotte's next message made Evelyn roll her eyes: [Does that mean you'll be sharing a bed with Nathaniel tonight?]

The morning sun filtered through the curtains of Pineview Villa, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. Evelyn stretched beneath the silk sheets, her fingers brushing against the cold, empty space where Nathaniel should have been.

She checked her phone - 7:32 AM. Three unread messages from Gregory about the new project proposal. One from her mother, Margaret, asking about weekend plans. Nothing from Nathaniel.

The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted upstairs. Alfred must have already prepared breakfast. Evelyn slipped into her robe, the fabric whispering against her skin as she descended the grand staircase.

The dining room was set with exquisite china, but only one place setting. "Where's Nathaniel?" she asked, trying to keep her voice light.

Alfred hesitated just a fraction too long before answering. "Mr. Martin left early this morning, madam. He mentioned an urgent meeting with Mr. Yates."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her coffee cup. Another morning without seeing her husband. This made the seventh day in a row. She scrolled through her calendar - the charity gala was tonight. Nathaniel had promised they'd attend together.

Her phone buzzed. A notification from The Metropolitan Times: "Martin Group Heir Spotted at Luxury Hotel with Former Flame." The accompanying photo showed Nathaniel's unmistakable profile beside Isabella Davis's laughing face.

The coffee turned bitter in her mouth.

Gabrielle's call came through at that moment. "Evelyn, we have a problem with the Montgomery project. The client wants to see revisions by noon."

Work. At least work never disappointed her. "I'll be there in forty minutes," she replied, already mentally rearranging her day.

As she dressed, Evelyn's gaze kept returning to the newspaper photo on her nightstand. Isabella's hand resting possessively on Nathaniel's arm. The diamond bracelet glittering on her wrist - the same design Evelyn had admired last month.

The intercom buzzed. "Madam, your car is ready," Alfred announced.

Evelyn took one last look at the photo before dropping it into the drawer. Tonight's gala would be interesting indeed. She had questions that needed answers, and Nathaniel would provide them - whether he wanted to or not.

The morning sunlight caught the emerald on her left hand as she closed the front door behind her. The stone flashed green fire, like a warning. Or a promise.

###Chapter 190 Baby
Evelyn glanced at her phone, then turned it off and rose from the couch. She slipped away to the bathroom unnoticed.

The living room buzzed with laughter and warmth, but Evelyn didn’t linger when she returned. Instead, she stepped outside into the garden, settling onto the swing beneath the afternoon sun. Closing her eyes, she let the gentle sway lull her into a drowsy calm.

The quiet was interrupted by soft footsteps. Isabella stood a few paces away, her gaze sharp and unrelenting.

Evelyn’s eyes fluttered open, meeting Isabella’s cold stare. Without hesitation, she stood, ready to retreat inside.

Isabella blocked her path, lips curling into a smirk. "Evelyn, how shameless of you to show up for Nathaniel’s birthday. Didn’t you hear what was said at the hospital? Even he admitted he only married you for a child. Are you really this delusional?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "And?"

Isabella’s confidence wavered slightly. "You can’t possibly think a baby will make him love you."

A dry laugh escaped Evelyn. "Is that what you’re afraid of? That a child will tie him to me permanently?"

"Don’t be ridiculous," Isabella snapped, though her eyes flickered away. "Nathaniel would never fall for you."

The words stung, but Evelyn refused to let it show. She tilted her head, feigning amusement. "Are you sure about that?"

By afternoon, the gathering had moved to the backyard for a barbecue. Thomas, ever the entertainer, manned the grill with exaggerated flair. "A small token of gratitude for Nathaniel putting up with me all these years," he announced, earning chuckles from the group.

Evelyn picked at her food, careful not to overeat. Isabella noticed immediately.

"Not hungry, Evelyn?" she purred, loud enough for others to hear. "Or is the food not to your taste?"

All eyes turned to Evelyn.

She smiled sweetly. "How attentive of you, Isabella. Have you been watching me this closely?"

Isabella stiffened. "I just happened to notice."

"Really?" Evelyn’s tone was light, but her gaze was razor-sharp. "Then you must also know I’ve been savoring every bite. But thank you for your… concern."

A flush crept up Isabella’s neck as the others exchanged glances.

Evelyn took a sip of her drink, her expression unreadable. The game was far from over.



###Chapter 191

The morning sun streamed through the tall windows of the penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. Evelyn stretched lazily in bed, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

She sighed, pushing back the silk sheets. The scent of his cologne lingered faintly on his pillow, a bittersweet reminder of how little time they had spent together lately.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory.

"Meeting in thirty. The investors are getting impatient."

Evelyn groaned. The pressure was mounting. The architectural project she had poured her heart into was on the verge of collapse, thanks to Summit Realty’s sudden withdrawal.

She quickly dressed in a tailored navy suit, her fingers deftly fastening the buttons. As she stepped into the living room, Alfred, their butler, appeared with a tray of coffee.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin."

"Morning, Alfred," she murmured, accepting the cup. The rich aroma of espresso did little to soothe her nerves.

Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was an unknown number.

"We need to talk. It’s about Nathaniel."

Evelyn’s grip tightened around her phone. The message was unsigned, but she had a sinking feeling she knew exactly who it was from.

Isabella.

Her stomach twisted. The woman had been a ghost from Nathaniel’s past, haunting the edges of their marriage. And now, she was back.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Whatever game Isabella was playing, she wasn’t going to let her win.

But first, she had a company to save.

The elevator doors slid open, revealing the sleek, modern lobby of Mitchell & Wilson Architects. Gabrielle, her assistant, rushed toward her, eyes wide with urgency.

"Evelyn, thank God you’re here. The investors are already inside. They’re demanding answers."

Evelyn straightened her shoulders. "Then let’s not keep them waiting."

As she strode into the conference room, all eyes turned toward her. The air was thick with tension.

Gregory gave her a tight smile. "Glad you could join us."

She didn’t miss the sarcasm in his tone. Ignoring it, she placed her tablet on the table and faced the room.

"Ladies and gentlemen, I understand your concerns. But I assure you, this project is far from over."

One of the investors scoffed. "Then explain why Summit Realty pulled out."

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. She had no answers—yet. But she would find them.

Just as she opened her mouth to respond, her phone vibrated again. Another message.

"Meet me at the old café. Noon. Don’t tell Nathaniel."

Her pulse quickened.

This wasn’t just about business anymore.

It was personal.

"I don't have friends like you," Evelyn said coolly, arching a brow. "If you love spinning fantasies so much, maybe you should quit singing and become a novelist instead." She cast Isabella a dismissive glance before turning to the others. "The barbecue was delicious, but my best friend visited me these past few days, and we indulged a bit too much. My stomach isn’t handling it well. Enjoy the party without me."

Her explanation made Thomas nod in understanding. "No worries. Just take it easy."

Theodore chimed in, flashing a grin. "It’s nothing serious. Don’t overthink it. Let’s raise our glasses to Nathaniel instead."

Isabella’s lips pressed into a thin line, clearly displeased at being brushed off. She shot Evelyn a frosty glare but reluctantly lifted her glass along with the others.

As the barbecue wound down, the bonfire party kicked into full swing.

The group sat in a loose circle, laughter and chatter filling the air. Glasses clinked, and when the mood struck, a few even got up to dance. The atmosphere was electric, everyone lost in the moment.

Then, someone—probably Theodore—grinned and suggested, "How about a game? Truth or Dare?"

No one objected.

Isabella grabbed an empty wine bottle and handed it to Nathaniel with a smirk. "You go first."

Nathaniel set the bottle on the ground and gave it a spin. It wobbled before landing on—

Thomas.

Theodore barked out a laugh. "Karma’s quick tonight, huh?"

The others joined in, amused.

Thomas rolled his eyes but shrugged. "Fine. Ask away."

Theodore leaned forward, mischief glinting in his eyes. "Ever been dumped?"

A few of the guys snickered—they all knew Thomas’ history.

Thomas shot Theodore a dark look, but Theodore just grinned wider. "Truth or Dare?"

"Truth," Thomas muttered.

Then it was his turn to spin. The game continued, questions growing bolder, dares more ridiculous. Thomas and Theodore ended up as the main targets, their friends merciless in their teasing.

Evelyn had almost relaxed, thinking she’d escape unscathed—until the bottle spun and landed squarely on her.

Thomas smirked. "Evelyn. Truth or Dare?"

"Truth," she answered smoothly.

His grin turned wicked. "Who’s the one man you’ve never been able to forget?"

Silence.

Nathaniel’s gaze snapped to her, intense and unreadable. Even Isabella looked stunned, her drink halfway to her lips.

Evelyn didn’t flinch. "Him."

Him?

Dominic tilted his head. "Care to elaborate?"

She merely smiled. "That’s a second question."

Fair enough.

But Nathaniel’s stare burned into her, as if trying to peel back layers she wasn’t willing to reveal. Evelyn ignored it, spinning the bottle again. This time, it landed on Thomas once more.

For the rest of the night, luck stayed on her side—she didn’t lose again. The question hung in the air, unanswered.

Nathaniel, oddly enough, never got picked. He just watched, his gaze never leaving Evelyn for long.

Eventually, they cut the cake just before midnight and headed inside.

Evelyn’s phone buzzed as she stepped onto the balcony. "Gregory? It’s late. Everything okay?"

Gregory’s voice was calm. "Did I wake you?"

"No. What’s wrong?"

"I’m leaving Mayby for a couple of days. Wanted to give you a heads-up."

Her grip tightened on the phone. "Did something happen?"



###Chapter 192

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Pineview Villa, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. Evelyn stood by the window, her fingers tracing the rim of her coffee cup absently. The warmth of the liquid did little to ease the chill in her chest.

Nathaniel had left early again—another meeting, another excuse. She sighed, setting the cup down with a quiet clink. The silence of the villa was suffocating.

Her phone buzzed, snapping her out of her thoughts. It was a message from Gregory.

"Evelyn, the client approved the final blueprints. We’re moving forward with the project."

A small smile tugged at her lips. At least work was going well. She typed a quick reply before glancing at the clock. She had promised to meet Charlotte for lunch today.

The café was bustling when she arrived, the scent of freshly baked pastries mingling with the rich aroma of coffee. Charlotte waved her over from a corner table, her expression brightening as Evelyn approached.

"You look like you could use this," Charlotte said, sliding a cappuccino toward her.

Evelyn chuckled, wrapping her hands around the warm cup. "That obvious?"

Charlotte leaned forward, lowering her voice. "So, how are things with Nathaniel?"

Evelyn hesitated. "Complicated."

Before Charlotte could press further, Evelyn’s phone buzzed again. This time, it was an unknown number.

"We need to talk. It’s about Nathaniel."

Her stomach twisted. She didn’t recognize the sender, but something about the message sent a shiver down her spine.

Charlotte frowned. "Everything okay?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Just work."

But as she stared at the screen, she couldn’t shake the feeling that whatever was coming would change everything.

Nathaniel sat in his office, his fingers drumming against the polished mahogany desk. Samuel had just delivered the latest financial reports, and the numbers weren’t adding up.

"Someone’s been siphoning funds," Samuel said quietly.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Find out who."

As Samuel left, Nathaniel’s phone rang. The caller ID made his blood run cold.

Isabella.

He hesitated before answering. "What do you want?"

Her voice was smooth, almost teasing. "Miss me already?"

"Cut the games," he snapped.

She laughed softly. "Fine. I have information you’ll want to hear. Meet me tonight. Alone."

The line went dead before he could respond.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. Whatever Isabella was planning, it couldn’t be good. But he had no choice—he had to know what she knew.

Evelyn paced her bedroom, the anonymous message burning in her mind. Who would contact her about Nathaniel? And why?

Her phone buzzed once more.

"Midnight. The old pier. Come alone."

Her pulse quickened. This was a risk—but if it involved Nathaniel, she had to go.

Meanwhile, across town, Nathaniel stepped into the dimly lit bar where Isabella waited, her crimson lips curling into a smirk as she raised her glass in greeting.

"Let’s talk business," she purred.

The game was far from over.

Nathaniel's voice was low and steady as he responded, "Don't worry about it. It's just that Danielle has been acting up lately. My parents can't handle her, so they asked me to come back and keep an eye on her."

Evelyn knew about his sister, Danielle.

She nodded quickly. "Of course, you should stay with her. It's been a while since you've seen her, hasn't it? Is she graduating soon?"

"Yes, next year. Then she’ll start her internship. I’ll leave early tomorrow morning. You’ll have to manage things at the company. If anything comes up, just call me. I’ll be back in two days at most."

Nathaniel spoke carefully, his words laced with concern.

Evelyn smiled softly. "Take your time. She needs you more right now."

They exchanged a few more words about work before ending the call—nearly five minutes in total.

Evelyn glanced out the window at the moonlit sky, admiring the serene beauty of the night.

Then she tucked her phone away and returned to the living room. Thomas and the others were deep into a card game, joined by two other women. But Nathaniel and Isabella were nowhere to be seen.

A frown flickered across her face, a strange mix of emotions tightening in her chest.

She reached into her bag and pulled out a small, elegantly wrapped gift—something she had picked out for Nathaniel’s birthday. A bitter smile touched her lips.

Might as well give it to him now.

After all, this would be the last time.

His next birthday wouldn’t involve her.

"Has anyone seen Nathaniel?" she asked casually.

Thomas glanced up from his cards. "Think he stepped outside to take a call. You might find him out there."

Outside in the garden, Nathaniel had just ended a call from his parents—their usual birthday wishes, followed by a reminder to take care of Evelyn.

His mind drifted back to her answer during the Truth or Dare game.

Who was the man she mentioned?

Was it the ex who had broken her heart?

He clenched his jaw. He wanted to know exactly what kind of man could make her sacrifice so much.

The thought alone darkened his mood, his expression turning icy.

He slipped his phone into his pocket and turned to head back inside—only to see Isabella approaching from the opposite side. She held out a small box with a hesitant smile.

"Nathaniel, happy birthday. It’s just a tie clip—nothing extravagant, but I thought it suited you. I hope you don’t mind."

Nathaniel didn’t move, his gaze cool. "You didn’t have to get me anything. I don’t need gifts."

"Nathaniel, I just wanted to thank you. For finding that specialist for my mother. If it weren’t for you, I don’t know what I would’ve done."

His expression softened slightly. He reached out to take the gift—but in the next second, Isabella suddenly stepped forward and wrapped her arms around his waist, pressing herself against him.

Nathaniel stiffened, his voice sharp with displeasure. "What are you doing?"

Her voice was soft, pleading. "Nathaniel, I’m sorry. I just… I can’t help myself. I love you too much to be rational. Just let me have this one moment, please?"

His frown deepened, his expression turning stormy. Just as he was about to push her away—

"Seems like I picked the worst time to interrupt."

Nathaniel turned sharply to see Evelyn standing on the steps, her face unreadable, her eyes cold.

He shoved Isabella away, his glare cutting like ice.

Isabella quickly stammered, "Evelyn, it’s not what you think! This was all me—Nathaniel had nothing to do with it."

Evelyn’s lips curled into a humorless smile. "Then should I applaud your boldness?"

Her voice was light, but her gaze was glacial.
###Chapter 193

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting delicate patterns across the hardwood floor. Evelyn stretched beneath the silk sheets, her fingers brushing against the cold, empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

She sighed, running a hand through her tousled auburn hair. The digital clock on the nightstand blinked 8:47 AM. Late. Again.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory.

"Evelyn, the client moved the meeting to 10. Don’t be late this time."

She groaned. The Kensington project was already behind schedule, and the clients were growing impatient. Throwing off the covers, she padded to the ensuite bathroom, the marble tiles cool beneath her bare feet.

The shower did little to wash away the exhaustion clinging to her. As she towel-dried her hair, her gaze caught the framed photo on the vanity—her and Nathaniel on their wedding day, his arms wrapped around her waist, both of them laughing under a shower of rose petals.

That seemed like a lifetime ago.

Dressed in a tailored navy pantsuit, Evelyn grabbed her portfolio and headed downstairs. Alfred, their butler, stood by the foyer, holding out her usual espresso.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin. Your car is ready."

"Thanks, Alfred." She took the cup, the bitter warmth grounding her.

The drive to the office was a blur of cityscapes and honking cars. Her mind, however, was elsewhere—on Nathaniel’s increasingly distant behavior, on the whispered rumors about Isabella Davis’s return to the city, on the gnawing feeling that something was terribly wrong.

Her phone buzzed again. Unknown number.

"We need to talk. It’s about Nathaniel."

Evelyn’s grip tightened on the steering wheel.

Who was this? And what did they know about her husband?

The light turned green. She accelerated, her pulse quickening.

Whatever this was, she wouldn’t ignore it.

Before Evelyn could speak, Nathaniel cut in, "Evelyn just came to give me a present."

His words caught her off guard. Was he explaining himself to Isabella?

Isabella merely gave him a fleeting glance, her expression unreadable. She stepped forward and handed Nathaniel a neatly wrapped box. "Happy birthday," she said flatly, offering no reaction to his earlier remark.

Nathaniel studied her for a moment before accepting the gift. Without hesitation, he unwrapped it.

Inside lay a sleek black wristwatch.

Though not from a luxury brand, its craftsmanship was impeccable.

Isabella’s sharp eyes caught the delicate engraving on the dial. "Is this… a Seraphina design?" she blurted, unable to hide her surprise.

Seraphina was a legendary watchmaker, notoriously selective about her commissions. Despite offers from elite brands, she had remained independent, building her own empire.

Nathaniel’s gaze softened as he traced the signature with his thumb. He looked up at Evelyn. "Did Seraphina make this?"

Evelyn shrugged. "A friend of mine knows her."

Her tone was indifferent, as if it were nothing significant.

But Nathaniel knew better.

Seraphina didn’t take requests lightly. For Evelyn to secure a custom piece meant she had gone to great lengths.

This watch was one of a kind.

Nathaniel’s eyes warmed as they lingered on Evelyn, the space between them charged with unspoken understanding. Isabella, standing forgotten, clenched her fists.

She forced a smile. "Evelyn, you know Seraphina? That’s… surprising. Even industry insiders struggle to get an audience with her. Unless your friend is very close to her?"

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. He shot Isabella a warning look.

But she pressed on, feigning concern. "I’m just thinking—what if it’s a replica? Nathaniel can’t risk wearing a counterfeit at formal events."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Are you implying this is fake?"

"I never said that," Isabella countered smoothly. "But you do seem defensive."

"Funny. Weren’t you the one who gifted Edward a forged painting last year?"

The memory struck like a whip. Isabella paled. That scandal had humiliated her in front of high society.

Her lips trembled as she turned to Nathaniel. "You know I didn’t mean to—"

"Ms. Davis," Evelyn interrupted coolly, "if crying is your only rebuttal, maybe you should leave."

Tears welled in Isabella’s eyes. "Nathaniel, are you really going to let her treat me like this?"

"Did I lie?" Evelyn scoffed. "If the truth offends you, then everyone must be ‘bullying’ you."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "Enough," he said, his voice low but firm.

His neutrality stung. Evelyn’s expression frosted over.

Isabella dabbed at her tears, a smug glint flashing in her eyes. "It’s fine," she murmured. "For your sake, Nathaniel, I’ll let it go."

Evelyn said nothing, her gaze locked onto Nathaniel with icy detachment.

Then, without looking at Isabella, he said, "Go inside."



###Chapter 194

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

She sighed, sitting up and running a hand through her tousled hair. The weight of their recent argument still lingered in the air, unspoken but suffocating.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory.

"Evelyn, we need to talk. The Summit Realty deal is falling apart. Sebastian is demanding revisions—again."

She groaned. Just what she needed. Another crisis before breakfast.

Downstairs, Alfred had already prepared her coffee—black, no sugar, just the way she liked it. The rich aroma filled the kitchen, a small comfort in the chaos of her morning.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin," Alfred greeted, his voice smooth as ever. "Mr. Martin left early. He mentioned an urgent meeting with Mr. Yates."

Evelyn nodded, sipping her coffee. "Of course he did."

Her phone buzzed once more. This time, it was Isabella.

"We need to talk. It's about Nathaniel."

Evelyn's grip on her cup tightened. What now?

She exhaled sharply, setting the coffee down. Whatever it was, she wasn’t ready. Not yet.

But life rarely waited for readiness.

The doorbell rang. Alfred moved to answer it, but Evelyn waved him off. "I'll get it."

She opened the door to find Vanessa standing there, her expression unreadable.

"Evelyn," Vanessa said, her voice clipped. "We have a problem."

Evelyn's stomach twisted. "What kind of problem?"

Vanessa hesitated, then handed her a folded newspaper. "The kind that makes headlines."

Evelyn unfolded it, her heart pounding.

And there it was—Nathaniel’s face splashed across the front page, his arm wrapped around Isabella in a dimly lit restaurant. The headline screamed:

"Martin Heir Rekindles Old Flame—Is His Marriage Over?"

The world tilted.

Evelyn’s fingers trembled as she gripped the paper.

This wasn’t just a problem.


Evelyn's breath hitched as Nathaniel's cold dismissal hung in the air. She forced a nod, her voice barely steady. "Fine. I'll leave you two to talk."

Nathaniel didn’t even glance at her.

Her lips pressed into a thin line as she turned to leave. But the moment she took a step, her heel caught on the uneven floor. A gasp escaped her as she stumbled—right into Nathaniel’s arms.

His reflexes kicked in, his hands gripping her waist. The sudden closeness made Isabella’s eyes flash with fury.

Enough.

Evelyn quickly pulled away, cheeks flushed. "Nathaniel, I—I’m sorry. That was clumsy of me."

His expression darkened, unreadable.

When his gaze finally met Evelyn’s again, her voice was ice. "Nathaniel. I meant what I said. Let’s end this."

He barely reacted, turning to Isabella instead. "Go inside."

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms. "Are you even listening? I said I want a divorce. I’m done."

"Isabella. Inside. Now."

The command in his tone was absolute. Isabella hesitated, then shot Evelyn a triumphant look before stepping away.

Nathaniel’s indifference cut deeper than any argument. Evelyn’s lashes fluttered, her voice hollow. "You always do this. Shut me out. Act like I don’t matter. Why stay married when you’d clearly rather be with her?"

Isabella whirled around, indignant. "Evelyn, how dare you? You’re the one who’s never been there for him! You—"

Crack.

The slap echoed through the room.

Isabella staggered, clutching her stinging cheek. Her ears rang.

Evelyn’s eyes were glacial. "Stay out of my marriage. You’re exhausting."

Tears welled in Isabella’s eyes. "You—you hit me! I was just telling the truth! If you can’t handle it, that’s your problem!"

Evelyn scoffed, turning back to Nathaniel. He stood frozen, his silence louder than words.

Isabella’s voice trembled. "Nathaniel… if you’re okay with this, then maybe I should leave Mayby. For good."

The unspoken threat hung between them.

Evelyn waited.

Nathaniel said nothing.



###Chapter 195

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, she felt the weight of countless eyes on her. The air was thick with tension, a stark contrast to the elegant chandeliers and the soft murmur of classical music playing in the background.

Nathaniel stood by the marble fireplace, his expression unreadable. His fingers tightened around the crystal glass in his hand, the amber liquid inside catching the dim light. Across the room, Isabella—dressed in a sleek black gown that accentuated every curve—flashed him a knowing smile.

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. She had known this evening would be difficult, but she hadn’t anticipated the sheer hostility radiating from Isabella’s direction.

Gregory, ever the perceptive one, leaned in. "You okay?" he murmured, his voice barely audible over the hum of conversation.

She forced a smile. "Just peachy."

But she wasn’t. Not when every glance from Nathaniel’s former lover felt like a challenge. Not when she could still hear the whispers—She’s not good enough for him. She’ll never fit in.

Then, as if on cue, Isabella glided toward them, her heels clicking against the polished floor. "Evelyn," she purred, her voice dripping with false sweetness. "How lovely to see you again."

Evelyn met her gaze evenly. "Isabella. You look… striking."

A flicker of irritation crossed Isabella’s face before she masked it with another smile. "Oh, darling, you’re too kind." She turned to Nathaniel, her fingers brushing his arm. "Nathaniel, darling, you simply must introduce me to your grandfather. I’ve heard so much about him."

Evelyn’s jaw clenched. The audacity.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened, but before he could respond, Edward Martin himself appeared, his sharp eyes assessing the scene. "Ah, there you are," he said, his voice carrying the weight of decades of authority. "I was beginning to think you’d forgotten about your old grandfather."

Isabella’s smile faltered for a split second before she recovered. "Mr. Martin, it’s an honor."

Edward barely spared her a glance before turning to Evelyn. "And you, my dear, must tell me about your latest project. I’ve heard fascinating things."

The shift in the room was palpable. Isabella’s face flushed with barely concealed fury, while Evelyn fought the urge to smirk.

Game on.

As the evening wore on, the tension only grew. Every whispered conversation, every exchanged glance, felt like another move in a high-stakes chess match. And Evelyn? She wasn’t about to lose.

Not to Isabella.

Not to anyone.

Nathaniel reacted instantly, his brows knitting together in disapproval. "Evelyn," he said in a tone that brooked no argument, "you shouldn't have hit Isabella. Apologize to her."

The demand made Evelyn laugh bitterly.

"Why should I?" she countered, crossing her arms. "She was being nosy and intrusive. She deserved it."

"Evelyn, apologize."

"Not happening."

"Evelyn!"

Nathaniel's voice was sharp, his patience visibly thinning. His dark eyes bore into hers, simmering with displeasure.

She scoffed. "Would you even consider calling off the divorce if I did?"

He didn’t move, his expression hardening. "Is it so impossible for you to set this aside, even today?"

Today was his birthday.

Evelyn froze.

The commotion had drawn the others outside. Sensing the tension, they quickly intervened, trying to separate the two. But Nathaniel remained rooted in place, his gaze never leaving Evelyn’s face.

After a long silence, he finally spoke, his voice eerily calm. "You’re truly cruel, Evelyn."

Thomas and the others pulled Nathaniel inside, with Isabella trailing behind. Theodore stayed back, motioning for two girls to keep Evelyn company.

"Mrs. Martin," one of them said gently, "couples fight all the time. Just talk it out. Divorce isn’t the answer."

Evelyn didn’t respond. She just stood there, her expression stormy.

Eventually, she exhaled sharply. "I’m fine. Thank you. I’d like to be alone."

The two girls exchanged glances before nodding and heading inside.

Left by herself, Evelyn sank onto the stone bench in the garden, Nathaniel’s words echoing in her mind.

For some reason, in that moment, his eyes had looked unbearably lonely.

She frowned, trying to shake off the heaviness in her chest, but it clung to her like a shadow.

That night, Nathaniel, Thomas, and the others played cards until dawn. Evelyn stayed outside for a while before retreating to her room.

When she woke the next morning, only Theodore and two other girls remained in the villa. The rest had already returned to Mayby.

After breakfast, Theodore pulled his car around to wait for Evelyn, while the other two were sent back in a separate vehicle.

The drive was silent at first. Then Theodore spoke up. "Did you and Nathaniel argue last night?"

Evelyn smirked. "It wasn’t an argument."

Theodore chuckled but didn’t press further. "Sometimes, what we see isn’t the whole truth. People do things for reasons we might not understand."

Evelyn turned to him, puzzled. "What are you trying to say?"

"Nothing in particular," he said lightly. "Just thinking out loud."

But his words lingered in her mind like a riddle. Was he hinting at something about Nathaniel? That his actions weren’t as straightforward as they seemed?

She shook her head. No, Theodore had said he was just musing. It probably meant nothing.

Theodore dropped her off at her apartment, and as soon as she stepped inside, Gabrielle called.

"Ms. Mitchell," Gabrielle said urgently, "Summit Realty’s representatives are here. They’re demanding to know when the project will resume."

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. "We can’t proceed without the Martins’ approval. We have to wait."

But Gabrielle hesitated. "They’re threatening to halt all our other projects if we don’t give them an answer."

Evelyn’s expression darkened. They were backing her into a corner.

After a tense pause, she replied, "I’ll contact Mr. Martin. Tell them aggression won’t solve anything. We need to find a solution, not a fight."



###Chapter 196

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She tapped her pencil absently against the blueprint, her mind elsewhere entirely. The numbers on the spreadsheet before her blurred as she replayed last night's argument with Nathaniel for the hundredth time.

"Evelyn?" Gabrielle's voice broke through her thoughts. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

She straightened immediately, smoothing her blouse. "Send him in."

Gregory Wilson entered with his usual confident stride, but his eyes held concern. "You look like you haven't slept," he remarked, dropping a stack of files on her desk.

"Charming as always," Evelyn muttered, flipping open the top folder. Her breath caught. "The Summit Realty proposal? I thought we lost this bid months ago."

"We did." Gregory leaned against her desk, crossing his arms. "Sebastian Wilson just called. They're reopening the competition after some... irregularities with the winning firm."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. This was their chance to redeem themselves after the disastrous first attempt. But the timing couldn't be worse—not with her marriage crumbling and Nathaniel's increasingly erratic behavior.

Across town, Nathaniel Martin slammed his office door so hard the glass rattled. Samuel Yates jumped to his feet. "Sir—"

"Cancel my afternoon," Nathaniel snapped without breaking stride. He barely registered his secretary's startled expression as he stormed into his private elevator.

The penthouse was silent when he arrived, the air thick with tension from last night's fight. He poured himself three fingers of whiskey, ignoring the early hour. The amber liquid burned his throat but did nothing to dull the memory of Evelyn's accusation: "You're just like your father."

His phone buzzed. Isabella's name flashed on the screen. Nathaniel hesitated, then declined the call. He wasn't in the mood for her manipulations today.

Meanwhile, at a chic café downtown, Isabella Davis stared at her untouched latte, her manicured nails tapping an impatient rhythm. Vanessa slid into the opposite seat. "Well?"

"He didn't answer." Isabella's lips twisted into a bitter smile. "Evelyn must have gotten to him first."

Vanessa sighed. "We need to move faster. The gala's next week—"

"I know the timeline!" Isabella snapped, then forced a calmer tone. "Just make sure those photos are ready. Once Nathaniel sees what his precious wife has been hiding..."

Back at the office, Evelyn rubbed her temples as she reviewed the Summit Realty documents. Something wasn't adding up. She reached for her phone to call Nathaniel—force of habit—then stopped. Their last conversation had ended with shattered glass and tears.

Gabrielle appeared in the doorway again, her expression uneasy. "There's a... situation in the lobby."

Evelyn frowned. "What kind of situation?"

Before Gabrielle could answer, raised voices echoed down the hall. Evelyn rushed out to find a distraught Charlotte Bennett arguing with security.

"Let me through! I need to see Evelyn now!"

"Charlotte?" Evelyn pushed past the guards. Her best friend's face was streaked with tears. "What's wrong?"

Charlotte grabbed her arms, her grip painfully tight. "It's Nathaniel. You need to come with me right now." She lowered her voice to a terrified whisper. "They're saying he tried to kill someone."

Evelyn relayed the message to the representatives, yet they remained obstinate. They immediately contacted their boss Sebastian Wilson, reporting Nathaniel's stance. Sebastian offered no response, merely instructing them to return to the office.

Sebastian didn’t dare pressure Evelyn—not when she was Nathaniel Martin’s wife. The dynamics between the couple baffled him. Until he understood their game, reckless actions could prove disastrous.

After ending the call with Gabrielle, Evelyn stepped into her apartment. A text soon followed—Summit Realty’s representatives had left. But the issue wasn’t resolved.

Charlotte was still asleep when Evelyn returned.

Evelyn moved to the balcony, dialing Daniel Carter. "Is the Martin Group truly abandoning this project?"

"Evelyn, shouldn’t you know better?" Daniel sighed. "The suspension has even emboldened my rivals. Without Mr. Martin’s clarification, I’m left in the dark—and vulnerable."

His frustration was palpable.

A sudden realization struck Evelyn. Is this because of me? Did Nathaniel halt everything... because I defied him?

Guilt gnawed at her. If I’d just complied, so many wouldn’t be suffering.

Charlotte stirred awake, finding Evelyn brooding on the balcony. She leaned against her gently. "What’s wrong?"

"Do you think divorcing Nathaniel was a mistake?"

"Do you regret it?" Charlotte asked, bypassing explanations for the heart of the matter.

Evelyn shook her head.

She didn’t regret the choice—only the collateral damage.

Charlotte smiled. "Then stop second-guessing."

Evelyn mirrored her smile.

They spent the afternoon shopping, returning only after dinner.

The next morning, Evelyn headed to the office. With Gregory Wilson away temporarily, she was in charge.

Summit Realty’s Jonathan Blake arrived shortly after.

Jonathan—the smarmy project manager who’d handled negotiations—greeted her with a practiced smile. "Mrs. Martin, when can we resume the project?"

"I can’t confirm yet. The final decision isn’t mine."

"But Mr. Martin halted it abruptly. Surely you know why."

"I’m not privy to Martin Group’s internal decisions."

Jonathan’s smile turned razor-thin. "So the project’s dead?"

"I didn’t say that."

"Mrs. Martin, I’m just a messenger. Without an answer today, I won’t leave."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "You’re the one cornering me."

"Are you and Mr. Martin conspiring to sabotage us?" Jonathan challenged. "Call him now. Let’s settle this."

Cornered, Evelyn dialed Nathaniel’s office.

"May I speak to Mr. Martin?" she asked quietly.



###Chapter 197

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden streaks across her blueprints. She tapped her pen against the desk, lost in thought. The Martin Group project was nearing completion, but something felt off.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel.

"Meeting at the penthouse. 7 PM. Wear something nice."

Evelyn arched a brow. No explanation, just a command. Typical Nathaniel.

She exhaled, glancing at the clock. Five hours to prepare.

Her assistant, Gabrielle, knocked lightly before entering. "Evelyn, Gregory is here to see you."

Evelyn nodded. "Send him in."

Gregory strode in, his usual confident demeanor slightly frayed. "We have a problem."

She straightened. "What is it?"

"The zoning permits for the waterfront project just got delayed. Again."

Evelyn groaned. "That’s the third time this month."

Gregory ran a hand through his hair. "I know. And Summit Realty is breathing down our necks. Sebastian won’t wait forever."

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. Sebastian Wilson was ruthless, and if they lost this contract, it could jeopardize everything.

"I’ll handle it," she said firmly.

Gregory gave her a skeptical look. "How?"

Evelyn smirked. "I have my ways."

At 6:45 PM, Evelyn stood before the full-length mirror in her penthouse, adjusting the emerald-green dress that hugged her curves. The fabric shimmered under the dim lighting, and she paired it with delicate diamond earrings—a gift from Nathaniel on their first anniversary.

The elevator dinged.

She turned as Nathaniel stepped out, his charcoal suit immaculate, his dark eyes sweeping over her with approval.

"You look stunning," he murmured, closing the distance between them.

Evelyn tilted her head. "You still haven’t told me what this is about."

Nathaniel smirked, sliding a hand around her waist. "Patience, darling."

Before she could press further, the doorbell rang.

Nathaniel released her. "That’ll be our guests."

Evelyn frowned. "Guests?"

He didn’t answer, striding toward the door.

When he swung it open, Evelyn’s breath caught.

Standing in the hallway was Isabella Davis, Nathaniel’s ex, her crimson lips curved in a knowing smile.

And beside her—Edward Martin, Nathaniel’s grandfather, his sharp gaze locking onto Evelyn with unsettling intensity.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked.

What the hell is going on?

"Mrs. Martin? This is Samuel." Samuel Yates sounded mildly surprised. He hadn't anticipated Evelyn reaching out to the executive office.

Evelyn, too, was taken aback for a brief moment before regaining her composure. She cut straight to the point. "Yes. The project manager from Summit Realty needs to consult Mr. Martin regarding the development. Is he available?"

Samuel, ever the consummate professional, recognized the formal tone immediately. "Mrs. Martin, I'm afraid I can't provide any updates on the project at this time. Mr. Martin is currently away on business."

"A business trip? Since when?"

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her phone.

"He left directly from the resort to Dovie. Based on the company’s itinerary, he won’t be returning to Mayby for another two days, so—"

"Understood."

Evelyn didn’t let him finish. Her voice was clipped as she ended the call.

Turning to Jonathan Blake, she exhaled sharply. "You heard him. It’s not that I’m unwilling to help—there’s simply nothing I can do. Without a response from the Martin Group, we’ll have to wait."

Jonathan had witnessed the entire exchange. Learning that Nathaniel was away, he finally relented, though not without pressing her to "do her best" to expedite matters—a thinly veiled attempt to shift the burden onto her.

Once he left, exhaustion settled over Evelyn like a heavy cloak.

She hadn’t known about Nathaniel’s trip. The realization left an odd hollowness in her chest.

Why didn’t Samuel go with him? Did he leave alone?

The questions gnawed at her. Shaking her head, she forced herself to focus on work, burying any thoughts of Nathaniel beneath stacks of blueprints and contracts.

By evening, she was drained. Charlotte wasn’t up for dining out, so Evelyn swung by Scarlett to grab takeout before heading back to her apartment.

At first, nothing seemed amiss. But as she neared her building, a flicker of movement in her rearview mirror caught her attention. A sleek black sedan trailed a few car lengths behind.

Her grip on the wheel tightened.

Am I imagining things?

To test her suspicion, she took an abrupt turn at the next intersection.

The sedan followed.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. She accelerated, and the car behind matched her speed without hesitation.

Neither showed any sign of backing down.

Just as she prepared to make another sharp turn, a minivan barreled toward her from the opposite direction. Swerving to avoid a collision, she jerked the wheel too hard—her car veered off the road and slammed into a tree.

The impact threw her forward, the seatbelt digging into her shoulders.

For a moment, everything was still.

Then, adrenaline kicked in.

Hands trembling, she instinctively pressed a palm to her abdomen before checking the mirror. The sedan had paused briefly—then sped away, tires screeching.

Evelyn forced herself to breathe. Stepping out, she assessed the damage before calling the authorities. By the time everything was settled, night had fallen.

She dialed Charlotte, voice steadier than she felt.

"Something happened. I need to go to the hospital."

Charlotte’s panic was immediate. "What? What’s wrong?"



###Chapter 198

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, her breath caught in her throat. The chandeliers cast a soft golden glow over the marble floors, and the scent of fresh roses filled the air. But it wasn’t the opulence that unsettled her—it was the weight of the unspoken tension.

Nathaniel stood by the fireplace, his expression unreadable. His fingers tightened around the crystal glass in his hand, the amber liquid swirling as he turned to face her. "You're late," he remarked, his voice cool.

Evelyn resisted the urge to roll her eyes. "Traffic was terrible," she replied, smoothing the fabric of her emerald-green dress. She had chosen it deliberately—bold, confident, a silent challenge.

Isabella, draped in a sleek black gown, smirked from her perch on the armchair. "How typical," she murmured, sipping her champagne. "Always keeping people waiting."

Evelyn ignored the jab. She had dealt with Isabella’s petty remarks for years, and tonight was no different. Instead, she focused on Nathaniel. "You said this was urgent. What’s going on?"

He exhaled sharply, setting his glass down. "Edward wants to see us. All of us."

A chill ran down Evelyn’s spine. Edward Martin rarely summoned the family without reason. The last time he had, it had been to announce Richard’s removal from the board.

Gregory, who had been quietly observing from the corner, stepped forward. "Do we know why?"

Nathaniel shook his head. "Not yet. But it’s not good."

The double doors at the end of the hall swung open, and Winston appeared, his posture rigid. "Mr. Martin is ready for you."

Evelyn exchanged a glance with Nathaniel. His jaw was clenched, his usual composure slipping just enough for her to notice. She reached out, her fingers brushing his wrist. "Whatever it is, we’ll handle it."

For a fleeting second, his gaze softened. Then, just as quickly, it hardened again. "Let’s go."

As they followed Winston down the corridor, Evelyn couldn’t shake the feeling that their lives were about to change—again. And this time, she wasn’t sure if even Nathaniel could control the fallout.

The door to Edward’s study loomed ahead, heavy and imposing.

Evelyn took a deep breath.

And stepped inside.

"I'm fine. I'll head back soon."

Evelyn didn't elaborate. Her car had only suffered minor damage, so she drove herself to the hospital.

On the way, she called Caroline and briefly explained what had happened. After a quick examination—though the official results wouldn’t be ready for another half hour—Caroline pulled some strings, and the doctor gave her the preliminary report immediately.

Everything was normal. The baby was healthy. Evelyn had just been shaken up a little. She needed to rest for the next few days, and if nothing unusual happened within seventy-two hours, she’d be in the clear.

Relief washed over her.

But who had been following her tonight?

Caroline frowned. "Why were you driving so recklessly?"

Evelyn forced a small smile and shook her head. "Maybe I missed you and wanted to drop by for a visit."

"Next time, just call me for dinner. Your treat."

Evelyn chuckled. "Deal."

Since Caroline still had work to finish, she only walked Evelyn to the parking lot before heading back inside.

Evelyn sat in her car, not in a hurry to leave. Instead, she replayed recent events in her mind. She hadn’t made enemies—at least, not many. Only a handful of people had any reason to target her.

Isabella was the first she dismissed. Though Isabella had schemed to drive a wedge between her and Nathaniel, spreading rumors and twisting facts, she wouldn’t dare something this extreme. If anything happened to Evelyn, Isabella would be the prime suspect.

That left Summit Realty.

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed slightly. She picked up her phone and dialed Sebastian directly.

She’d gotten his number during their last meeting. Now, it proved useful.

Sebastian answered, and Evelyn didn’t waste time. "Mr. Wilson, I know the project caused Summit Realty significant losses, but I suffered too. If you think threatening me will get the project restarted, you’re mistaken. I’m not that influential. Push this further, and instead of reviving the deal, you’ll be facing charges for deliberate harm."

Sebastian’s voice remained calm. "What are you implying?"

"You know exactly what I mean. My car nearly flipped tonight. Be grateful it was only nearly. Do you really think the Martins will let this slide?"

Without waiting for a reply, she hung up.

That was enough. Some things didn’t need over-explaining.

Her warning had its intended effect. Sebastian immediately called his subordinate. When he learned what had happened, he cursed under his breath. "Idiot! I told you to watch her, not run her off the road!"

He tried calling Evelyn back, but she ignored it. Eventually, she blocked his number entirely.

Only then did she exhale in relief.

At least she knew Sebastian’s motives. The worst scenarios were the ones where the enemy stayed hidden.

She fastened her seatbelt and started the car, but just as she pulled out, her phone rang again.

A quick glance at the screen made her freeze.

"Martin Manor."

She connected via Bluetooth. "Hello?"

"Evelyn? It’s Victoria."

Nathaniel’s mother.

Evelyn softened her tone. "Is everything all right, Victoria? Why are you calling so late?"

"Everything’s fine. Where are you now?" Victoria’s voice was warm but measured.

"On my way home."

"Did you just finish work?"

"Yes."

"Evelyn," Victoria said gently, "you’re lying."
###Chapter 199

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of our penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. I stretched beneath the silk sheets, my fingers brushing against the empty space where Nathaniel should have been. The cold sheets told me he'd left hours ago - another early morning at Martin Group headquarters.

My phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. Gabrielle's name flashed across the screen with three missed calls. I groaned, rubbing sleep from my eyes as I answered.

"Evelyn! Thank God you're awake," Gabrielle's voice crackled with urgency. "Gregory's been trying to reach you for an hour. The Summit Realty project - there's been a major development."

I sat bolt upright, the last remnants of sleep evaporating. "What happened?"

"They're demanding revisions to the waterfront design by end of day. Sebastian Wilson himself called the office."

My stomach dropped. The Summit Realty project was our firm's biggest commission this year. I threw back the covers, already mentally rearranging my schedule. "Tell Gregory I'll be there in forty minutes. And Gabrielle - cancel all my afternoon appointments."

As I rushed through my morning routine, I couldn't shake the nagging feeling that something was off. Nathaniel had been distant lately, buried in some secretive acquisition deal. Last night, he'd come home after midnight smelling faintly of jasmine - Isabella's signature perfume.

The elevator doors slid open to reveal our firm's sleek reception area. Gregory stood waiting, his usually impeccable suit slightly rumpled, dark circles under his eyes. "Thank goodness," he breathed. "Jonathan Blake just sent over their notes. They want to scrap the entire eastern pavilion."

"What?" I grabbed the tablet from his hands, scrolling through the redlined documents. "This makes no architectural sense. The pavilion anchors the whole design!"

Gregory ran a hand through his salt-and-pepper hair. "I know. But Sebastian's threatening to pull the contract if we don't comply."

I set my jaw. "Then we'll make him see reason. Set up a meeting for this afternoon."

As I strode toward my office, my phone vibrated again. An unknown number. I answered warily.

"Evelyn Mitchell?" A woman's voice, smooth as velvet. "This is Vanessa. Isabella's agent. We need to talk."

The blood drained from my face. Isabella Davis - Nathaniel's ex, the woman who'd haunted our relationship from the beginning. "About what?"

"About the photos that are about to surface. Meet me at Café Blanc in an hour. Come alone." The line went dead.

My hands trembled as I lowered the phone. Whatever game Isabella was playing, I wouldn't let her destroy what Nathaniel and I had built. Not again.

But first, I had a multimillion-dollar project to save. Squaring my shoulders, I pushed open my office door, ready to face the storm gathering on all fronts.

Before Evelyn could utter a word, Edward's voice came through the phone, firm yet gentle. "Evelyn, wait at the hospital entrance. I've sent the car for you. Come see me—we should talk."

Her breath hitched. How did the Martins already know about her hospital visit? Even Edward and Victoria were aware.

Soon, she arrived at the Martin estate. The moment she stepped into the grand foyer, Victoria rushed forward, her eyes wide with concern. "Are you hurt? You scared me half to death! Why didn’t you tell us about the accident?"

Evelyn offered a soft smile, brushing it off. "It was nothing serious, just a minor bump."

Edward, however, studied her intently before gesturing toward the garden. "Evelyn, walk with me."

"Of course." She set her bag down and helped him outside.

Victoria frowned, turning to Richard. "Why does Edward always pull Evelyn aside like this? Does he think we’re not treating her well enough?"

Richard chuckled, shaking his head. "Don’t overthink it. He just adores her. And you? You’re the perfect mother-in-law."

"And she’s the perfect daughter-in-law," Victoria sighed, then shot Richard a sharp look. "If that son of yours lets her slip away, he’ll die a bachelor!"

Richard suppressed a groan. Spoken like a true mother.

Outside, Evelyn guided Edward to a stone bench beneath the sprawling oak. He studied her carefully. "You’re sure you’re unharmed?"

A knowing smile curved her lips. "You mean the baby?" She placed a hand over her stomach. "Everything’s fine. Just a scare."

"Thank heavens." Then, as if catching himself, he added, "Not just the baby—you matter too."

"I know, Edward." Her smile warmed. "You’ve always been too good to me."

The tension in his shoulders eased. Silence settled between them, comfortable yet weighted. Then, quietly, he asked, "Did you spend Nathaniel’s birthday at the resort?"

Her lashes flickered. "Yes."

"Evelyn… do you truly dislike him?"

She blinked. "Why ask me this now?"

"Call it an old man’s curiosity." He sighed. "If there’s even a flicker of affection in your heart, let me help. But if there’s none… then he doesn’t deserve you. Some things can’t be forced."

"He doesn’t deserve me?" The phrase almost made her laugh.

She exhaled, choosing her words carefully. "Edward, it’s not about like or dislike. Nathaniel and I… we’re simply not meant to be."

She appreciated his kindness, but no amount of interference could bridge what wasn’t there.

Edward nodded, accepting her answer without pressing further.

Later, after sharing Victoria’s homemade pie, Evelyn returned to her apartment.

The moment the door closed behind her, Victoria pounced. "What did you two talk about?"

Edward sipped his coffee, unfazed. "Nothing of consequence."



###Chapter 200

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. Evelyn stretched beneath the silk sheets, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for the office—again.

She sighed, rolling onto her back. The weight of last night’s argument still lingered in the air. Isabella’s sudden reappearance had stirred old wounds, and Nathaniel’s evasive answers only fueled her unease.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory:

"Meeting with Summit Realty at 10. Sebastian’s pushing for revisions. Need you there."

Evelyn groaned. Sebastian Wilson was relentless, always finding flaws in their designs. She typed a quick reply before tossing the phone aside.

Downstairs, Alfred stood by the dining table, arranging breakfast with practiced precision. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted, his voice smooth as aged whiskey.

"Morning, Alfred," she murmured, pouring herself a cup of coffee. The rich aroma did little to soothe her nerves.

The doorbell chimed.

Alfred moved to answer it, returning moments later with an envelope in hand. "For you, ma'am."

Evelyn frowned. The thick, cream-colored paper bore no return address. She tore it open, her breath hitching as a single photograph slipped out.

It was Nathaniel.

And Isabella.

Locked in an embrace outside a hotel she didn’t recognize.

Her fingers trembled. The date stamped in the corner was from last week—the same night he’d claimed to be working late.

The coffee turned bitter on her tongue.

A knock at the door startled her. Caroline stood on the threshold, her expression grim. "We need to talk," she said, holding up an identical envelope.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted.

This wasn’t a coincidence.

Someone was playing games.

And she intended to win.

Evelyn knew Nathaniel didn’t want to discuss it, but she stopped pressing and simply said, "Did Isabella tell you what happened between her and Nathaniel? Why not summon them both back to the Martin Estate like before? That way, you can keep an eye on them, and it might help mend things faster."

"Feel free to share your plans with me, but don’t mention them in front of Isabella. Otherwise, she might refuse to step foot in the Martin Estate ever again."

Evelyn’s eyes widened in shock.

Richard responded, "Let them handle their own affairs. As elders, we can’t interfere indefinitely."

Edward’s brow furrowed slightly, his stormy gaze heavy with unspoken thoughts. After a long pause, he finally spoke, his voice eerily calm. "If they truly divorce, that ungrateful bastard will never be welcome here again."

The declaration left Richard and Evelyn utterly stunned.

Neither dared to argue—they understood better than anyone how deeply Edward cherished Nathaniel. If he had made such a decision, there had to be a reason.

Even after returning to her room, Evelyn couldn’t shake her unease. Nathaniel was away on business in Dovie. After some deliberation, she decided to call him.

Nathaniel had just arrived back at his hotel. He tossed his suit jacket onto the sofa before striding toward the floor-to-ceiling window, answering the call. "What is it?"

"When are you coming back?"

"Two days."

"What’s keeping you in Dovie for so long? Can’t you delegate to your team?"

"Mother, I’m the CEO of Martin Group. Handing off critical projects to subordinates would show a lack of commitment. If you’re truly concerned about my workload, convince your husband to return and assist me."

Evelyn glanced at Richard, who was absorbed in a book on the sofa, and replied coolly, "Don’t even think about it."

"So this was just performative concern?" Nathaniel chuckled dryly.

Evelyn scoffed. "Insufferable."

"What did you really want to say?"

"Isabella was in a car accident today."

His voice sharpened instantly. "When? Is she hurt?"

"Stop exaggerating. It was a minor collision—she’s fine," Richard interjected. "Nathaniel isn’t even home. There’s no need to worry him unnecessarily."

"Would he even care? I doubt he’d notice if his wife vanished," Evelyn muttered bitterly.

Nathaniel’s tone turned icy. "You spoke to Isabella? What did she say?"

"Yes. She said she’s done with you. Maybe you should reflect on that."

With that, she abruptly ended the call.

Richard frowned at her. "You’re only making him feel worse."

"If he feels guilty, good. At least that means he still cares. What terrifies me is if he doesn’t—if he’s completely lost to Isabella."

Evelyn sighed, knowing she couldn’t push too hard. Nathaniel was still her son.

But her words had struck a nerve. Nathaniel stood frozen by the window, his grip tightening around his phone until his knuckles turned white. His expression darkened, a storm brewing in his eyes.

So eager for a divorce that she’d say it to my parents?

His jaw clenched. Finally, he dialed a number.

Evelyn had just reached her apartment. Before she could unlock the door, her phone buzzed in her bag.

She pulled it out, her breath hitching at the name on the screen. Her lashes fluttered as she hesitated—then answered just before it went to voicemail.

"Hello?"

"Were you in an accident?"

Nathaniel’s voice was low, devoid of emotion.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. He must have heard from Evelyn.

"It wasn’t serious," she murmured.

His tone turned dangerously soft. "What would you consider serious?"



###Chapter 201

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew across the keyboard as she finalized the blueprints for the new Martin Group project. The scent of freshly brewed coffee from Gabrielle's desk mingled with the faint aroma of pine from the miniature Christmas tree in the corner.

A sharp knock interrupted her concentration. "Come in," she called without looking up.

The door swung open to reveal Nathaniel, his tailored navy suit accentuating his broad shoulders. In his hands were two steaming cups from her favorite café. "Thought you could use a break," he said, placing one cup carefully beside her mousepad.

Evelyn's lips curved into an automatic smile as she accepted the drink. "You're early. Weren't you supposed to be in that meeting with the Japanese investors until noon?"

Nathaniel leaned against her desk, his expression turning serious. "Edward called an emergency board meeting. Something about the Summit Realty acquisition." His fingers absently traced the rim of his coffee cup. "I have a bad feeling about this."

Downing the last of her coffee, Evelyn stood and smoothed her pencil skirt. "Then let's not keep them waiting." She grabbed her tablet and followed Nathaniel out the door, her heels clicking against the marble floors.

The elevator ride to the executive floor was unusually tense. Nathaniel's jaw clenched visibly, his fingers tapping an erratic rhythm against his thigh. Evelyn reached out instinctively, her hand covering his restless one. "Whatever it is, we'll handle it together," she murmured.

The boardroom was already filled when they arrived. Edward Martin sat at the head of the table, his expression unreadable. Sebastian Wilson from Summit Realty occupied the seat to his right, looking entirely too pleased with himself.

"Ah, Nathaniel, Evelyn," Edward greeted them without rising. "We were just discussing some... changes to our acquisition strategy."

Sebastian smirked, adjusting his cufflinks. "Changes that require Evelyn's immediate resignation from the project."

The air left Evelyn's lungs as if she'd been punched. "Excuse me?"

Nathaniel's hand found the small of her back, steadying her. "That's not happening," he said coldly. "Evelyn's designs are integral to this development."

Edward sighed, rubbing his temples. "Be that as it may, Summit Realty has raised... concerns about potential conflicts of interest." His gaze flickered between them meaningfully. "Given your personal relationship."

Sebastian leaned forward, his voice dripping with false sympathy. "It's nothing personal, Evelyn. Just business. Though I must say, your designs were... ambitious for someone with your limited experience."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. She opened her mouth to respond, but Nathaniel beat her to it.

"Limited experience?" His voice was dangerously quiet. "Evelyn graduated top of her class at Yale, won the Young Architect Award last year, and has single-handedly brought in three major clients for Mitchell & Wilson. What exactly are your qualifications, Sebastian? Aside from inheriting daddy's company?"

The room fell silent. Edward's lips thinned. "That's enough." He turned to Evelyn. "The board has voted. You're off the project effective immediately."

Evelyn felt the blood drain from her face. All those sleepless nights, the meticulous planning—gone in an instant. She forced herself to breathe evenly. "I see. If you'll excuse me." Turning on her heel, she walked out with as much dignity as she could muster.

Nathaniel caught up with her at the elevator. "Evelyn, wait—"

She held up a hand, her vision blurring with unshed tears. "Not now, Nathaniel. I need... I need to think."

The elevator doors closed between them, cutting off his response. As the car descended, Evelyn pressed her forehead against the cool metal, her mind racing. This wasn't just about the project. This was about control. About sending a message.

And she'd be damned if she'd let them win.

Evelyn stood frozen, her breath catching in her throat.

She didn’t know how to respond.

After a tense pause, Nathaniel’s voice cut through the silence like ice. "So, discussing our divorce with my family behind my back—was that just a casual conversation for you?"

Evelyn’s brows knitted together. "I don’t follow."

"Is it that you don’t follow, or you just refuse to?" Nathaniel’s lips curled into a humorless smile. His dark eyes narrowed, pinning her with an unreadable glare. "Tell me, Evelyn. Are you really that desperate to end this?"

Her lips pressed into a thin line, but she remained silent.

Nathaniel stepped closer, his voice dropping dangerously low. "Answer me. Is this what you want?"

Evelyn had no idea why he was confronting her like this now.

She suspected Edward, Victoria, or Richard must have said something.

After a brief hesitation, she exhaled softly and met his gaze. "Yes. I can’t wait any longer."

Nathaniel let out a sharp, bitter laugh. "Bravo, Evelyn. If you’re so determined to walk away, then fine. Consider it done."

Her breath hitched.

The line went dead before she could react.

Even though she’d gotten what she wanted, relief never came.

Instead, something hollow settled in her chest—an ache that spread like slow poison, relentless and suffocating.

Evelyn didn’t understand herself.

This was your decision. Why does it hurt so much now?

She lingered at the doorway, gripping the edge of the counter until her knuckles turned white. Only when she was certain her voice wouldn’t shake did she finally step inside.

Charlotte was sprawled on the couch, phone in hand, but she immediately sat up when she noticed Evelyn’s expression. "Hey, you’re back late. Everything okay?"

Evelyn forced a faint smile. "Just overtime. You wouldn’t get it."

"Ouch. That sounded personal." Charlotte tossed her phone aside and stood, arms open. "Hug?"

Evelyn sidestepped her. "Did you eat?"

Charlotte huffed, plopping back down. "Yeah. But you’re deflecting." She hugged a pillow to her chest, studying Evelyn closely. "Something’s up. Spill."

Evelyn didn’t answer, her tone light but distant. "Maybe you’ve been single too long. Imagining drama where there isn’t any."

"Please. My studio’s barely surviving. I don’t have time to imagine things."

"Then focus on that instead of my life," Evelyn shot back, though there was no real bite to it.

Charlotte’s expression softened. "Evelyn… whatever it is, I’m here. You know that, right?"

Evelyn gave a small, tired smile but said nothing.

Nathaniel’s words haunted her all night.

And the next morning, the call came.

Samuel’s hesitant voice filtered through the phone. "Mrs. Martin… Mr. Martin asked me to meet you. Are you free? He—"

"Just say it, Samuel."

A beat of silence. Then—

"He sent over the divorce papers. He wants your signature."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her phone.

"Did he… sign them already?" she whispered.



###Chapter 202

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers hovered over the latest blueprints for the Martin Group's coastal resort project, but her mind was elsewhere. Nathaniel had been distant lately—ever since that unexpected phone call from Isabella last week.

A sharp knock interrupted her thoughts. "Come in," she called, straightening her posture.

Gabrielle, her assistant, stepped inside with a tablet in hand. "Ms. Mitchell, Mr. Wilson is here to see you. He says it's urgent."

Evelyn frowned. Gregory never visited unannounced unless something was wrong. "Send him in."

Gregory strode into the room, his usual composed demeanor replaced by visible tension. "We have a problem," he said without preamble, dropping a folder onto her desk. "Summit Realty just filed a lawsuit against us. They're claiming intellectual property theft on the resort designs."

Her breath hitched. "That's impossible. Those are our original designs."

"According to their legal team, Sebastian Wilson has documents proving otherwise." Gregory ran a hand through his hair. "They're demanding an immediate halt to construction and seeking damages."

Evelyn's pulse raced. This couldn't be happening—not when they were so close to securing the final approval from Edward Martin. She reached for her phone. "I need to call Nathaniel."

Gregory caught her wrist. "Wait. There's more." He lowered his voice. "I did some digging. The documents Summit submitted? They're dated before we even started this project. Someone leaked our preliminary drafts."

Ice flooded her veins. "Who would—" The answer struck her before she could finish. Isabella. It had to be. She'd been Nathaniel's first love, and she'd made no secret of her resentment toward Evelyn. But sabotaging a multi-million-dollar project? That was a new low.

Her phone buzzed with an incoming call from an unknown number. She answered cautiously. "Hello?"

"Evelyn Mitchell?" A smooth, unfamiliar male voice greeted her. "This is Donovan Sinclair. I believe we have mutual interests regarding a certain... predicament you've found yourself in."

Her grip tightened on the phone. "How do you know about that?"

A low chuckle. "Let's just say Sebastian Wilson isn't as careful with his secrets as he should be. Meet me at The Velvet Hour tonight—nine sharp. Come alone." The line went dead.

Gregory raised an eyebrow. "Trouble?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Or a lifeline." She stood, grabbing her blazer. "Cancel my afternoon meetings. I need to see Nathaniel before this spirals further."

As she hurried toward the elevator, her mind raced with possibilities. Was Donovan connected to Isabella? Or was this another player entering the game? One thing was certain—the stakes had just gotten dangerously high.

"Not yet. Mr. Martin only had me prepare it last night, so—"

"Bring it to me. I'm at the office," Evelyn cut Samuel off sharply.

She assumed it was the same document she had previously sent to Martin Group. If so, she had already signed it—Nathaniel only needed to add his signature.

But since he had redrafted it, signing again wouldn’t matter.

After hanging up, Evelyn sat motionless at her desk, her hands drifting to her abdomen. A whisper escaped her lips. "Sweetheart, it’s just you and me now. Mommy and Daddy… we’re done."

The moment Samuel received her response, he called Nathaniel.

"Well?" Nathaniel’s voice was ice.

"Mrs. Martin said to bring it to her company."

"Then do it."

Nathaniel’s tone was clipped, his expression unreadable. His mind burned with Evelyn’s face—her defiance, her stubbornness. The more he thought, the tighter his chest constricted.

"Once she signs," he continued, voice devoid of warmth, "cut all ties with Mitchell Group. I don’t want a single project, a single transaction left between us."

Samuel hesitated. "Sir, with all due respect—some of our joint ventures are in their final stages. Terminating abruptly could trigger backlash. Shouldn’t we at least wait until—"

"I’m not asking for your opinion," Nathaniel snapped. "I’m giving you an order."

There was no room for negotiation.

Samuel exhaled. "Understood."

The call ended. Nathaniel’s jaw clenched.

This was simple. Either she surrendered—or she faced the consequences.

Thirty minutes later, Samuel arrived at Evelyn’s office.

She skimmed the divorce agreement with detached indifference. The terms barely differed from her original draft—no demands, no disputes. She wanted nothing from the Martins.

Pen in hand, she signed without hesitation. Then she met Samuel’s gaze. "Let me know when he’s free to finalize the paperwork."

Samuel nodded, though something flickered in his eyes. He debated speaking—but held back.

Evelyn noticed. "Something else?"

He forced a polite smile. "Mrs. Martin… are you certain about this?"

Her brows furrowed. For a fleeting second, she wondered if Nathaniel had sent him to ask.

But no.

The papers were here. This was over.

Their marriage was always meant to end.

###Chapter 203

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden streaks across her blueprints. She tapped her pen against the desk, lost in thought. The Pineview Villa project was nearing completion, but something nagged at her—something she couldn’t quite place.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel.

"Dinner tonight? I have something to discuss."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. Nathaniel had been distant lately, buried in Martin Group affairs. She typed back quickly.

"Of course. 7 PM?"

Before she could set her phone down, another notification popped up—this time from Gregory.

"Meeting with Summit Realty in 30. Sebastian Wilson is bringing Jonathan Blake. They’re pushing for revisions."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Summit Realty had been relentless, demanding changes that compromised her vision. She grabbed her blazer and strode toward the conference room, determination in her steps.

The meeting was tense.

Sebastian leaned forward, his polished smile not quite reaching his cold eyes. "Evelyn, the investors want a more commercial appeal. Open spaces, fewer custom details."

Jonathan nodded beside him, flipping through the proposal. "We’re talking about maximizing profit here."

Evelyn’s grip tightened on her pen. "This isn’t just another high-rise. Pineview Villa is a legacy project. Edward Martin entrusted it to me because of its artistic integrity."

Sebastian smirked. "And yet, Nathaniel’s the one signing the checks now, isn’t he?"

The words stung.

Before she could retort, her phone buzzed again—Isabella’s name flashing on the screen.

"We need to talk. It’s about Nathaniel."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted.

By the time she reached the café, Isabella was already seated, her designer sunglasses perched atop her head. She looked every bit the Hollywood star—poised, polished, and utterly unreadable.

"You’re late," Isabella remarked, stirring her iced tea.

Evelyn slid into the opposite chair. "What’s this about?"

Isabella leaned in, lowering her voice. "Nathaniel’s hiding something. Something big."

A chill ran down Evelyn’s spine. "What do you mean?"

Isabella’s lips curved into a knowing smile. "Let’s just say… the Martins have more skeletons than their mansion has rooms."

Evelyn’s phone buzzed—again. Nathaniel.

"Change of plans. Meet me at the estate. Now."

Isabella’s eyes gleamed. "Looks like you’re about to find out."

The Martin estate loomed ahead, its iron gates swinging open as Evelyn’s car approached. Alfred stood at the entrance, his expression grim.

"Mr. Martin is waiting in the study," he murmured.

Evelyn’s heels clicked against the marble floors as she made her way through the opulent halls. The air was thick with tension.

Nathaniel stood by the fireplace, his back to her. When he turned, his face was unreadable.

"We have a problem," he said quietly.

Evelyn’s breath caught. "What kind of problem?"

Nathaniel hesitated—just for a second—before answering.

"The kind that could destroy everything."

Evelyn didn’t give Nathaniel the satisfaction of a direct response. Instead, she kept her tone cool and detached. "Mr. Yates, I’d appreciate it if you stopped referring to me as Mrs. Martin. The divorce papers are signed. Ms. Mitchell will do just fine."

Her words were answer enough.

Samuel nodded, clutching the documents before exiting her office without another word.

Desperate to distract herself, Evelyn snatched up a sketchpad and pressed her pencil to the paper. Drawing had always been her refuge, her way of silencing the chaos in her mind.

But not today.

Today, the lines blurred, the strokes uneven. Her thoughts refused to be tamed.

She bit down on her lower lip, frustration simmering beneath her skin.

Yet, Nathaniel wasn’t about to let her wallow in peace.

Less than thirty minutes after the ink dried on their divorce agreement, a bombshell detonated across the local business forums. An anonymous insider leaked that Martin Enterprises had abruptly severed all ties with Mitchell Holdings—even halting projects on the brink of completion.

The message was clear: Nathaniel was cutting Evelyn out of his life, professionally and personally.

Rumors about their crumbling marriage had circulated before, but neither had ever confirmed them. Now, with business alliances dissolving, speculation exploded. Had they already divorced? Was this the final nail in the coffin?

The media swarmed like vultures, and Isabella became their prime target. Reporters ambushed her outside her studio, microphones thrust in her face.

"Ms. Davis, is it true Nathaniel ended his marriage for you?"

"Are you the reason behind their sudden split?"

"Care to comment on your role in all this?"

Isabella kept her lips sealed, though inside, triumph surged. She’d waited years for this moment—for Evelyn to be erased from Nathaniel’s life. And now, it was finally happening.

Meanwhile, the Martin family erupted in chaos. Edward, Nathaniel’s grandfather, collapsed from the stress, his blood pressure skyrocketing. He was rushed to the hospital before Evelyn even heard the news.

Not that she had time to process it. The Mitchells descended on her next, demanding she grovel for Nathaniel’s forgiveness, hurling accusations until she had no choice but to shut off her phone.

Evelyn never imagined Nathaniel would go this far. Their business dealings had existed long before their marriage—their personal lives shouldn’t have dictated corporate decisions. But he’d drawn a line in the sand, and now, he was burning every bridge between them.

The injustice of it all coiled tight in her chest, a storm she couldn’t suppress. Finally, she dialed Nathaniel’s number, only to be met with the robotic voice of his voicemail.

"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable."

Her grip on the phone tightened.

Swallowing her pride, she called Samuel instead. "Mr. Yates, what the hell is Nathaniel playing at? Terminating contracts over a divorce? Is he trying to ruin me?"

"Ms. Mitchell," Samuel replied carefully, "Mr. Martin’s orders were explicit. As for his whereabouts, he may be in transit. I should also inform you—Sir Edward has been hospitalized."

Guilt twisted Evelyn’s stomach. She’d been so consumed by her own turmoil, she hadn’t even known.

When she arrived at the hospital, Edward had already been settled into a private room. Victoria, Nathaniel’s mother, met her with weary eyes but no blame.

"Evelyn," she said softly, taking her hand. "Don’t blame yourself. It was the shock, that’s all. His vitals are stable now."

But Evelyn knew better.

Nathaniel hadn’t just ended their marriage.

He’d declared war.



###Chapter 204

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort in the Maldives. The design was ambitious, but she thrived on challenges.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, stepped in with a tray of coffee. "You've been at it since dawn," she remarked, placing the cup within Evelyn's reach. "Nathaniel called. He said he’ll be late for dinner tonight."

Evelyn sighed, stirring her coffee absentmindedly. "Another meeting?"

Gabrielle nodded. "With the board. Something about the merger."

Evelyn’s grip tightened around the mug. The merger—Edward Martin’s latest obsession. It meant more power for the Martin Group, but at what cost? Nathaniel had been distant lately, buried under the weight of his family’s expectations.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Gregory: "We need to talk. Urgent."

Frowning, she typed a quick reply. "On my way."

Gregory was waiting in the conference room, his expression grim. "We have a problem," he said without preamble. "Summit Realty just pulled out of the Maldives project."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. "What? Why?"

"Sebastian Wilson claims our designs don’t align with their vision. But I think it’s personal."

Her jaw clenched. Sebastian had been a thorn in her side ever since she rejected his advances at last year’s gala. "I’ll handle it."

As she reached for her coat, her phone rang again. An unknown number.

"Evelyn Mitchell?" a smooth, unfamiliar voice greeted.

"Who is this?"

"Vanessa. Isabella’s agent."

Evelyn froze. Isabella Davis—Nathaniel’s ex, the woman who had once shattered his heart. "What do you want?"

Vanessa chuckled. "Just a friendly heads-up. Isabella’s back in town. And she’s very interested in reconnecting with Nathaniel."

The line went dead.

Evelyn’s pulse roared in her ears. This wasn’t a coincidence. First the merger, then Summit’s withdrawal, now Isabella’s return. Someone was playing a dangerous game.

And she intended to win.

Victoria led Evelyn to the hospital room, where Edward had already regained consciousness. He was in the middle of a heated argument with Richard, his voice trembling with fury. "That ungrateful wretch! Does he think he can turn against us? Has he forgotten every sacrifice the Martins have made for the Mitchells? And now he dares to betray us?"

Edward's anger was so intense that his breathing became labored, his face flushed crimson, veins bulging in his neck as he coughed violently.

Seeing this, Evelyn rushed forward, placing a soothing hand on his back. "Grandfather, please, don't upset yourself. Your health comes first."

Edward grasped her hand weakly, giving it a reassuring squeeze. "Evelyn, I owe you an apology. I'm sorry for all this mess."

"Grandfather, you have nothing to apologize for. None of this is your fault..."

After all, it was Evelyn who had chosen to go through with the divorce. Though Nathaniel had initiated it, she had insisted on finalizing it.

She couldn’t blame herself—nor could she blame him entirely.

But she never expected Nathaniel to retaliate so viciously.

The thought of Edward collapsing because of Nathaniel’s actions made her blood boil, but she bit her tongue, not wanting to worsen his condition.

Yet Edward, ever perceptive, gave her a firm look. "Evelyn, don’t worry. The Martins will handle this."

She managed a small nod. "Grandfather, whatever you decide, just promise me you won’t push yourself too hard. Victoria and Richard are already worried sick."

Edward exhaled, nodding in agreement, while Richard and Victoria murmured their assent.

Just as Edward was about to say more, the door burst open.

Nathaniel strode in, his black suit dusted with the remnants of a long day, his dark hair slightly disheveled. His expression was unreadable, but his stormy eyes locked onto Evelyn’s.

Before anyone could react, Edward snatched the nearest water glass and hurled it at him. "Get out! How dare you show your face here? Leave!"

The glass struck Nathaniel’s shoulder with a dull thud, but he didn’t so much as flinch.

Victoria rushed forward, gripping his arm. "Couldn’t you have announced yourself? Look what you’ve done—Grandfather is furious!"

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened, his gaze never leaving Evelyn’s. His voice was rough when he finally spoke. "We’ve argued. We’ve shouted. Are you satisfied now?"

Edward was too incensed to reply.

Richard stepped forward, his tone icy. "Nathaniel, stop provoking him. Reinstate the partnership with Mitchell Group immediately and issue a statement that this was a misunderstanding."

"If I retract my decision now, what credibility will I have left in the company?"

"You—"

"This wasn’t an impulsive move. It’s been planned for a long time. No one changes my mind."

His words were final, leaving no room for negotiation.

Evelyn stared at his cold, unyielding expression, her chest tightening painfully.

Edward had heard enough. Richard and Victoria, fearing another outburst, dragged Nathaniel out of the room.

Silence settled heavily in their absence.

Finally, Edward turned to Evelyn, regret in his eyes. "Evelyn, I—"

"Grandfather," she interrupted softly, forcing a smile. "Don’t dwell on it. Focus on recovering. Who else will spoil our baby when they arrive?"



###Chapter 205

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, her breath caught in her throat. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the marble floors, and the air hummed with the murmurs of high society. She adjusted the emerald silk of her gown, her fingers trembling slightly.

Nathaniel stood at the center of the room, his broad shoulders accentuated by the tailored black tuxedo. His dark eyes locked onto hers, and for a heartbeat, the world around them faded.

"Evelyn," he murmured, closing the distance between them. His hand brushed against hers, sending a jolt of warmth through her veins.

She forced a smile, though her pulse raced. "Nathaniel. You look... stunning."

A smirk tugged at his lips. "Coming from you, that means everything."

Before she could respond, a familiar voice sliced through the tension.

"Isabella," Nathaniel said, his tone shifting.

Evelyn turned to see Isabella Davis gliding toward them, her crimson dress clinging to her curves like liquid fire. Her lips curled into a practiced smile, but her eyes—sharp as daggers—never left Evelyn.

"Darling," Isabella purred, looping her arm through Nathaniel's. "I was just telling Edward how much I missed these gatherings."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. She knew this game. Isabella had always been a master at playing the crowd, at making her presence impossible to ignore.

Nathaniel stiffened, his gaze flickering between the two women. "Isabella, you remember Evelyn."

"Of course," Isabella said, her voice dripping with false sweetness. "The architect. How... quaint."

Evelyn's smile didn't waver. "And you, Isabella. Still clinging to the past, I see."

The air between them crackled.

Just then, Gregory Wilson appeared at Evelyn's side, his expression tight. "Evelyn, we need to discuss the blueprints. Now."

She exhaled sharply, grateful for the escape. "Excuse me."

As she walked away, she could feel Nathaniel's eyes burning into her back.

And Isabella's laughter, cold and triumphant, followed her out.

The night was far from over.

Evelyn remained by Edward's side for what felt like hours, only leaving once his breathing steadied into sleep.

Stepping into the hallway, her gaze immediately landed on Nathaniel. He sat rigidly on the bench, his jaw clenched so tightly the sharp angles of his face stood out starkly. His suit jacket was missing, the sleeves of his white shirt rolled up to reveal a darkening bruise where Edward had struck him.

Their eyes met—his cold, detached, like winter frost.

A bitter smirk twisted his lips. "Evelyn, I thought you were unstoppable. So determined to divorce me, no matter the cost. And yet here you are."

"Is this really necessary?" Her voice was sharp, laced with ice. "Just because I want out, you have to burn everything down?"

Nathaniel's gaze darkened, his expression unreadable. "You think this is about destruction?"

"Isn't it?"

"Do you honestly believe I'd go to these lengths just for you?" His laugh was low, mocking, devoid of warmth.

Evelyn held his stare, unflinching. His next words cut deeper. "If we're ending this, it ends completely. No loose threads. No lingering connections. I'm just making sure of that. Isn't that what you wanted?"

His eyes flickered over her, cold and dismissive, as if she were nothing more than an inconvenience.

The message was clear—she wasn't worth the effort.

Her fingers curled into fists. "If you never wanted to see me again, you could have just said so. I would have walked away. But why drag innocent people into this?"

Nathaniel scoffed, pushing to his feet. He closed the distance between them, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Evelyn, who do you think you are? Since when do I take orders from you?"

"I'm not giving orders. I'm asking you to be reasonable. Our problems shouldn't destroy other lives."

"You were the one who said we should never cross paths again after the divorce." His tone was razor-sharp. "Or did you forget?"

She had said those words. And now he was throwing them back at her.

The man before her felt like a stranger—someone she had never truly known.

Nathaniel's gaze swept over her one last time, his voice chillingly calm. "The game started the moment you refused my offer. Did you really think I'd let you walk all over me forever?"

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line. Her voice trembled, but her eyes burned with defiance. "Nathaniel... you're... you're out of your mind."

Each word was deliberate, heavy with the weight of her shattered trust.

He only smiled, as if her pain meant nothing.

Neither of them would back down.

Evelyn had her pride. She wouldn't beg.

And with that, there was nothing left to say.
###Chapter 206

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Nathaniel’s penthouse, illuminating the scattered blueprints on the coffee table. Evelyn traced her fingers over the intricate designs, her mind racing with ideas for the new eco-resort project.

Nathaniel strode into the living room, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders. He paused, watching her with an unreadable expression. "You’re up early," he remarked, his voice smooth yet edged with something deeper.

Evelyn glanced up, her lips curving into a faint smile. "Couldn’t sleep. This project has me wired."

He moved closer, his presence commanding the space between them. "You’re pushing yourself too hard."

She exhaled, leaning back against the sofa. "Someone has to keep up with the Martin Group’s impossible deadlines."

A smirk tugged at his lips. "Or you could just admit you love the challenge."

Before she could retort, his phone buzzed. Nathaniel frowned at the screen, his jaw tightening. "Isabella’s lawyer is demanding another meeting."

Evelyn’s fingers stilled. "What does she want now?"

"Who knows?" His tone darkened. "But I’m done playing her games."

She studied him—the tension in his shoulders, the storm brewing in his eyes. "You don’t have to handle this alone."

Nathaniel met her gaze, the intensity in his stare sending a shiver down her spine. "I won’t let her near you again."

A knock at the door interrupted them. Alfred entered, his usual composure slightly frayed. "Sir, Mr. Ellsworth is here. He says it’s urgent."

Thomas burst in before Nathaniel could respond, his usually carefree demeanor replaced by urgency. "You need to see this." He tossed a tabloid onto the table.

The headline screamed in bold letters: "Isabella Davis Exposes Martin Family Secrets: Scandal Rocks High Society."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. Beneath it was a grainy photo of Edward Martin—Nathaniel’s grandfather—with a woman who wasn’t his wife.

Nathaniel’s knuckles whitened as he gripped the paper. "She’s crossed the line."

Thomas ran a hand through his hair. "This is just the beginning. She’s threatening to release more unless—"

"Unless what?" Evelyn demanded.

"Unless Nathaniel publicly reconciles with her."

Silence thickened the air. Evelyn’s pulse pounded in her ears. Isabella wasn’t just after revenge—she wanted to dismantle everything.

Nathaniel’s voice was lethally calm. "Get the legal team on standby. And find out who’s feeding her information."

As Thomas hurried out, Evelyn reached for Nathaniel’s hand. "We’ll handle this together."

His fingers intertwined with hers, warm and steady. "I won’t let her destroy us."

But as the door clicked shut, Evelyn couldn’t shake the gnawing fear—Isabella’s game had just begun, and the stakes were higher than ever.

After exchanging pleasantries, Evelyn exited the hospital before Nathaniel and Victoria. Just as she was about to leave, Victoria called out, "Evelyn, why not let Nathaniel drive you? It's been a while since you two spent time together, hasn't it?"

"Victoria, I have work to attend to, and Nathaniel should stay here with Grandfather," Evelyn replied coolly.

Without waiting for a response, she turned and walked away—the first time she had ever cut a conversation short so abruptly.

She simply couldn’t bear to stay a moment longer.

Watching Evelyn’s retreating figure, Victoria sighed under her breath. "Look at you, can’t even keep your own wife happy. No wonder Edward scolded you so harshly."

Her earlier concern had evaporated, replaced with cold disapproval.

Nathaniel remained silent, enduring the criticism without protest.

Tired of lecturing him, Victoria shot him a sharp glare before adding, "Your grandfather made it clear—if you don’t fix things with Evelyn, don’t bother coming home."

"Mr. Richard Martin, your wife is berating me. Aren’t you going to say something?" Nathaniel glanced at his father, his tone low and teasing.

Richard merely shrugged. "I’m under her thumb. You’re on your own."

Nathaniel could only offer a helpless smile, saying nothing more as he endured Victoria’s scolding.

Yet every other word out of her mouth was about Evelyn, and the image of this woman kept flashing before his eyes. Evelyn had a way of swaying hearts effortlessly.

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed slightly, his expression perfectly composed, but the shadows in his gaze lingered far longer than he cared to admit.

Evelyn left the hospital and headed straight to the office.

Nathaniel was relentless, determined to drag everyone connected to her into this mess.

Though her ties to the Mitchell family were fragile, she refused to let innocent people suffer because of her.

But right now, she felt powerless, unsure of what to do next.

The moment Evelyn stepped into the company lobby, Gabrielle seemed to have been waiting for her, rushing forward with a tense expression. "Ms. Mitchell, where have you been? I’ve called you multiple times—you didn’t answer!"

Evelyn checked her phone and realized it had been on silent.

"I didn’t hear it. What’s wrong?" she asked calmly.

Gabrielle glanced toward Evelyn’s office and lowered her voice. "Your father is here to see you."

"My father?"

"Yes, Mr. William Mitchell. It’s probably about the Martin Group suddenly cutting all ties with us," Gabrielle explained in a hushed tone before hesitating. "Ms. Mitchell, you and Mr. Martin are close, aren’t you?"

She wanted to ask if the rumors of marital trouble were exaggerated but held back, fearing it might cost her job.

Evelyn gave her a brief look before striding toward her office.

Inside, William sat on the sofa, his patience visibly wearing thin. The moment the door opened and Evelyn entered, he didn’t wait for her to speak.

"What the hell is going on with the Martins?" he snapped. "I called Martin Manor, and they said Edward isn’t home. Is this their way of avoiding me? After everything the Mitchells have done for them, is this how they repay us?"



###Chapter 207

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers hovered over the architectural blueprints as she chewed her lower lip in concentration. The new commercial complex project for Martin Group was proving more challenging than anticipated.

A sharp knock interrupted her thoughts. "Come in," she called without looking up.

The door swung open to reveal Nathaniel, looking devastatingly handsome in his tailored navy suit. "Working through lunch again?" His deep voice held a note of affectionate disapproval.

Evelyn's pencil stilled as she finally looked up. "The structural calculations for the west wing aren't—"

"Not another word about load-bearing walls," Nathaniel interrupted, rounding her desk with purposeful strides. He plucked the pencil from her fingers. "You've been at this since dawn. Even brilliant architects need to eat."

She opened her mouth to protest when her stomach growled loudly. Nathaniel arched an eyebrow, the corner of his mouth twitching. "Your stomach agrees with me."

"Fine," Evelyn conceded, pushing back from her desk. "But only if we can discuss the cantilever design over—"

Nathaniel silenced her with a finger to her lips. "No shop talk during lunch. That's our rule." His touch lingered just a moment too long, sending a familiar warmth through her.

As they stepped into the elevator, Evelyn's phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen and stiffened. Isabella's name flashed across the display with a text that simply read: "We need to talk."

Nathaniel noticed her reaction immediately. "What's wrong?"

Evelyn quickly locked her screen. "Nothing important. Just Gregory confirming our meeting tomorrow." The lie tasted bitter on her tongue, but she couldn't bring herself to mention Isabella's name—not when things between them had been so perfect lately.

The elevator doors opened to the lobby, where Alfred stood waiting with an umbrella. "Sir, madam," he greeted with a slight bow. "It's begun to rain."

Nathaniel took the umbrella and held it over them as they stepped outside. The sudden summer shower had transformed the city streets into glistening mirrors. Evelyn instinctively moved closer to Nathaniel, her shoulder brushing against his arm.

At the bistro, their usual corner table waited. The waiter brought Evelyn's favorite sparkling water without being asked. Nathaniel ordered for them both—another of their rituals that had developed over months of shared lunches.

Halfway through their meal, Evelyn's phone buzzed again. This time, the message was longer: "I have information about the night of the accident. Meet me at Café Blanc at 3."

Her fork clattered against her plate. Nathaniel's concerned gaze met hers. "Evelyn?"

She forced a smile. "Just... remembering I have that site visit this afternoon." The words felt heavy with deception. "I should probably head back soon."

Nathaniel studied her for a long moment before nodding. "Let me walk you to the office."

As they stepped back into the rain, Evelyn's mind raced. What could Isabella possibly know about that terrible night? And why reach out now, after all this time?

Nathaniel's hand found hers beneath the umbrella, his fingers intertwining with hers in silent support. Evelyn squeezed back, her heart torn between the comfort of his touch and the growing dread about what secrets the afternoon might reveal.

Evelyn strode to her desk, placing her purse down with deliberate calm. She waited for Nathaniel to finish his call before responding in an icy tone, "Grandfather is hospitalized. This has nothing to do with the Martins. It was Nathaniel and the Martin Group's decision."

"Evelyn, are you siding with Nathaniel now?"

"I'm not. I'm stating facts."

William's anger hadn't dissipated, his expression still stormy. "I don't care about your facts. Remember—you're a Mitchell, not a Martin. Think carefully. And Beatrice hasn't been well lately. Your mother and I believe you should decide for yourself. If you want to take her to Mayby for treatment, you'd better settle things with the Martins quickly and issue a public apology to the Mitchell family!"

Evelyn's brows knitted together, her voice tight with concern. "Grandmother is ill?"

"So think about it. For Beatrice's sake, perhaps it's time to have a serious discussion with the Martins," William said, his words laced with unmistakable threat.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes slightly, her tone deceptively composed. "What exactly do you want me to discuss with them?"

"You're married to Nathaniel. You have influence in the Martin Group. When you married him, Edward promised you shares, didn’t he? Isn’t it time he honored that? Has Nathaniel never mentioned this to you?"

William fired off question after question, none of which concerned Evelyn personally. Every word revolved around the Mitchells' interests.

Yet Evelyn truly hadn’t known Edward intended to give her shares. Whether he fulfilled that promise or not didn’t matter to her. Compared to wealth and power, she valued sincerity far more.

Faking kindness for a day was possible, but maintaining a facade for over three hundred days? Impossible.

The Martins had been genuinely good to her.

A faint, humorless smile touched Evelyn’s lips. "So you want me to take my share from the Martins and then cut ties completely?"

Her expression darkened, her gaze turning glacial.

William met her eyes before speaking again. "Evelyn, don’t think I’m being cruel. I have no choice. And you might not know this—Beatrice isn’t your mother’s biological mother. Your mother and I agree that since Beatrice raised you, you should be responsible for her. We have no obligation to care for her."

Evelyn could hardly believe what she was hearing.

If Beatrice wasn’t Margaret’s biological mother, then she wasn’t Evelyn’s blood grandmother either. And yet, they had been content to leave her in the care of someone unrelated by blood.

What were William and Margaret thinking?

Evelyn stared at him in silence, her eyes cold and distant. Any lingering guilt she might have felt toward the Mitchells evaporated in that moment.

As for Beatrice—blood or not—her gratitude was boundless.

At the thought of her grandmother, Evelyn’s expression turned icy. Her voice was even colder as she said, "I’m sorry. I can’t help you. Grandfather is hospitalized because of this, and I can’t persuade Nathaniel either. There’s nothing I can do."

"What do you mean nothing? You can’t even handle something this simple?"



###Chapter 208

"I can't deal with this anymore, so stop coming to me. As for Grandma Beatrice, I'll take care of her. She's been the one who stood by me all these years, guiding me through everything. To me, she's more than just a grandmother—she's been both mother and father to me. Blood ties or not, it doesn't matter!"

Evelyn's voice was firm, her gaze unwavering as she dismissed William with a cold finality.

William's face darkened with fury. He stormed toward her desk, his hands slamming down on the polished surface. "Evelyn, is this how you speak to your father?" he seethed.

"What do you want from me?" Evelyn shot back, her tone sharp. "Should I act like Sophia, playing the spoiled princess with no responsibilities? Have you ever given me the chance to be anything else?"

For the first time, Evelyn voiced the resentment she had buried deep inside. She no longer cared about holding back—not when her father had never truly seen her as anything more than an obligation.

But William remained convinced of his own righteousness. In his eyes, Evelyn was the problem—disobedient, ungrateful, and undeserving of the Mitchell name.

His words fell on deaf ears, like fists pounding against a wall. Frustrated, he could only glare at her before delivering his final blow. "Evelyn, do you really think the Martins would even look at you twice without the Mitchell name backing you?"

With that, he turned on his heel and stormed out, leaving behind a suffocating silence.

The argument didn’t stay private for long. Whispers spread through the company like wildfire. Moments after William left, Gabrielle slipped into the office, concern etched on her face. "Ms. Mitchell, are you okay?"

Evelyn forced a faint smile. "I'm fine. Just focus on your work."

Gabrielle hesitated but nodded, closing the door softly behind her.

Alone again, Evelyn sank into her chair, emotions churning inside her.

She had always assumed Beatrice’s kindness stemmed from guilt—some misplaced sense of duty toward Margaret. But now, she realized how wrong she had been.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "How is it that someone with no blood relation can love me so unconditionally, while my own parents treat me like a burden?"

Her fingers curled into fists, her expression hardening.

If Beatrice had given her so much, Evelyn would repay her in kind.

That afternoon, she arranged for Beatrice to be brought to Mayby. Worried that her own apartment might be too cramped, she rented the unit directly across the hall—a spacious, quiet place where Beatrice could rest comfortably.

As they talked, Evelyn learned more about Beatrice’s past. Beatrice had been Margaret’s stepmother, married to Evelyn’s grandfather after his first wife passed away. She had never had children of her own, choosing instead to devote herself to Margaret and Caroline’s mother. A sacrifice rarely acknowledged.

Seeing the hesitation in Beatrice’s eyes, Evelyn took her hands gently. "No matter what the past holds, you’re my grandmother in every way that matters. So please, stay here without any worries. Let me take care of you."

Beatrice smiled, touched, but still hesitant. "I’m just an old woman. I don’t want to trouble you."

"Nothing is a trouble," Evelyn insisted. "And I’m taking you to the hospital for a full check-up. No arguments."

Her tone left no room for refusal. Beatrice sighed but didn’t protest further, her weathered face softening with reluctant gratitude.

###Chapter 209

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She tapped her pencil absently against the blueprint, her mind elsewhere. The tension between her and Nathaniel had been palpable since their argument last night.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Evelyn?" Gabrielle poked her head in, holding a steaming cup of coffee. "Thought you could use this. You've been staring at that same page for twenty minutes."

Evelyn accepted the cup with a grateful smile. "Thanks. Just... distracted."

Gabrielle hesitated before speaking. "Mr. Wilson called earlier. He said the Summit Realty project needs your final approval by noon."

Evelyn's grip tightened around the cup. Sebastian Wilson had been relentless about pushing deadlines lately. "Tell him I'll have it ready."

As Gabrielle left, Evelyn's phone buzzed. Nathaniel's name flashed on the screen. Her thumb hovered over the answer button before she let it go to voicemail. She wasn't ready to talk yet - not when every conversation lately turned into another battle about Isabella.

The intercom crackled. "Evelyn? Your mother is on line two."

Evelyn sighed. Margaret Mitchell only called during work hours for one reason. "Put her through."

"Darling," Margaret's crisp voice came through the receiver. "We need to discuss the gala next week. The Martin family expects—"

"I know what they expect, Mother," Evelyn interrupted, rubbing her temple. "I'll be there. In the dress you picked. With Nathaniel. Just like every other year."

A pause. "Is everything alright?"

Evelyn glanced at the framed photo on her desk - her and Nathaniel laughing at their engagement party. "Just work stress. I'll see you Saturday."

She hung up before her mother could pry further. The clock ticked toward noon. Evelyn turned back to her blueprints, determined to lose herself in work. But the numbers blurred together, replaced by Nathaniel's hurt expression when she'd walked out of their bedroom last night.

A sudden commotion outside her office made her look up. Through the glass walls, she saw Gregory Wilson storming toward her door, Samuel Yates trailing nervously behind him.

"Evelyn!" Gregory threw open the door without knocking. "What's this I hear about you rejecting the Summit revisions?"

Evelyn stood slowly, squaring her shoulders. "Because they violate three building codes and would put residents at risk. I won't approve unsafe designs, Gregory."

Gregory's face turned red. "Sebastian is our biggest client! Do you know what this could—"

The office phone rang sharply. Gabrielle's voice came through, strained. "Evelyn? It's Mr. Martin. He says it's urgent."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. Nathaniel never called her at work. She reached for the phone, but Gregory slammed his hand down on the receiver.

"This conversation isn't over," he hissed.

Evelyn met his glare without flinching. "Get out of my office. Now."

As Gregory retreated, muttering threats, Evelyn grabbed the phone. "Nathaniel? What's wrong?"

His voice was uncharacteristically tense. "It's Grandfather. He's had another stroke. They're taking him to St. Mary's. I'm on my way now."

The blueprint slipped from Evelyn's fingers. "I'll meet you there."

She hung up and reached for her bag, her earlier anger forgotten. Whatever stood between her and Nathaniel, Edward Martin's crisis took precedence. As she rushed toward the elevator, her phone buzzed again - an unknown number.

The text message contained just four words: "He still loves me." Attached was a photo of Isabella Davis smiling next to a hospital sign for the neurology wing.

Evelyn's steps faltered. The elevator doors opened. She took a deep breath and stepped inside, the battle lines of her personal and professional wars converging at St. Mary's Hospital.

Evelyn understood Beatrice's worries. She pressed her lips together before speaking gently, "Beatrice, I'm expecting—over three months along now. I'll need your help with the baby once they arrive, so please take care of yourself, alright?"

When Beatrice learned of Evelyn's pregnancy, her eyes lit up. She grasped Evelyn's hands tightly, nodding eagerly. "Of course, my dear!"

Beatrice's sudden willingness to cooperate stemmed entirely from the news of Evelyn's pregnancy.

Evelyn planned to let Beatrice rest for a few days to regain her strength before scheduling a full medical check-up. Given Beatrice's age, she had the usual elderly ailments—heart disease, high blood pressure, and a host of other minor health concerns that required careful attention.

The Mitchells had caught wind of Evelyn moving Beatrice to Mayby and had tried reaching out repeatedly. But Evelyn had been avoiding their calls without fail.

After settling Beatrice in, Evelyn returned to her apartment across the street. The moment she stepped inside, she spotted Charlotte curled up on the sofa, knees hugged to her chest, lost in thought. "What's wrong?" Evelyn asked.

She had been so preoccupied with Beatrice that she hadn’t noticed how unusually quiet Charlotte had been.

Charlotte’s expression tightened. "I have to go back to Dattlech."

"So soon?" Evelyn frowned. "Is it because I haven’t been able to spend time with you these past few days?"

"No. Something came up. I have to leave."

Charlotte shook her head, her usual vivacity replaced by exhaustion.

Evelyn studied her. "What happened?"

For a long moment, Charlotte just stared at her, face unreadable. Then, softly, she asked, "Evelyn... do you know who the man I left was?"

"Who?" Evelyn had never pried before. They had always respected each other’s privacy.

"Someone you know," Charlotte said.

Evelyn’s brows knitted together. She hesitated before voicing a name. "Thomas?"

Charlotte’s silence was confirmation enough.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "It’s really him?"

"Yes. But I lied to you. It wasn’t me who left him. He’s getting engaged. I didn’t want to be the other woman, so I walked away."

Evelyn had only heard fragments about Thomas’s situation, never the full story.

Now, watching Charlotte’s reaction, she couldn’t help but ask, "So... he found out you came to Mayby?"

Charlotte exhaled sharply. "Yes. Somehow, he got my number. He knows I’ve been staying with you. That’s why I have to go back, Evelyn. I’ve already booked my flight."

"When?"

"In two hours."

A beat of silence passed before Evelyn nodded. "Then let’s go. I’ll drive you. Don’t worry about packing—I’ll send your things later."

Charlotte agreed, and within minutes, they were on their way to the airport.

Time was slipping away too quickly.

At the security checkpoint, Evelyn watched Charlotte disappear into the crowd. Just before boarding, she received a text:

"I’ll call when I land."

Charlotte’s flight was supposed to arrive in Dattlech by ten that night. Evelyn waited, planning to call her then—but the phone went straight to voicemail.

At first, she assumed the flight had been delayed or Charlotte’s phone had died. But by midnight, there was still no response.

A knot of unease twisted in Evelyn’s stomach.

If Thomas was involved...

Confronting him in the middle of the night wasn’t an option. After a moment’s hesitation, Evelyn got into her car and drove to Pineview Villa.

She hadn’t been back since moving out. Standing before the familiar gates, something tight coiled in her chest.

Her fingerprint still worked. The door clicked open.



###Chapter 210

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel's steady breathing was the only sound in the quiet room. She traced the sharp line of his jaw with her fingertips, marveling at how peaceful he looked in sleep—so different from the commanding presence he carried during the day.

A soft knock interrupted the moment.

"Mrs. Martin?" Alfred's voice was muffled through the door. "Mr. Edward has requested your presence in the study."

Evelyn sighed, reluctantly slipping out from under the covers. She threw on a silk robe and padded barefoot down the grand hallway, her mind already racing. Edward Martin rarely summoned her directly—something was up.

The study smelled of aged leather and polished wood. Edward sat behind his massive oak desk, his sharp blue eyes assessing her as she entered.

"Evelyn," he greeted, his tone unreadable. "Sit."

She obeyed, fingers tightening around the armrests.

"I've reviewed your latest proposal for the waterfront project," he said, sliding a folder toward her. "It's bold. Risky."

Her pulse quickened. "But?"

A rare smile tugged at his lips. "But I like it. The board won’t, of course. They prefer safe investments."

Evelyn exhaled slowly. "Then why show it to me?"

"Because," Edward leaned forward, "I want you to convince them. This family needs fresh vision, and Nathaniel believes in you." His gaze darkened. "But Isabella Davis is circling. She’s been whispering in Richard’s ear, pushing her own designs."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. Isabella—Nathaniel’s ex, the woman who still held a piece of his past.

"Don’t let her undermine you," Edward warned. "The gala tonight—it’s your stage. Own it."

As Evelyn left the study, her phone buzzed. A message from Gregory: "Emergency at the site. Need you ASAP."

She swore under her breath.

Nathaniel intercepted her at the stairs, his tie half-knotted. "You look like you’ve seen a ghost."

"Just your grandfather," she muttered, adjusting his collar. "And Isabella’s scheming."

His jaw tensed. "Ignore her."

"Easy for you to say," she shot back, then instantly regretted it when hurt flickered in his eyes.

Before she could apologize, Samuel appeared, phone in hand. "Sir, the Tokyo call—"

Nathaniel pressed a quick kiss to her forehead. "We’ll talk tonight."

As he strode away, Evelyn squared her shoulders. Two battles awaited her today—one at the construction site, the other in a ballroom full of vipers.

And she refused to lose either.

Evelyn didn’t go upstairs, nor did she intend to seek him out. Instead, she dialed Nathaniel’s number.

Her lips pressed together lightly as she waited for the call to connect. When it did, she spoke softly, "Are you home?"

"Is there an issue?" Nathaniel’s voice was rough, edged with something unreadable.

Evelyn hesitated briefly before replying calmly, "Have you gone to bed yet? I’m at Pineview Villa right now. If you’re still awake, maybe we could talk?"

"Talk about what? The divorce? It’s just paperwork, Evelyn. Did you really need to come here in the middle of the night to discuss it?" His tone was sharp, laced with irritation and something darker—anger.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. She didn’t understand why he was suddenly so hostile.

She bit her lower lip lightly before answering in a quiet voice, "I wanted to ask you something about Thomas."

"So you show up at my door at this hour to talk about another man?" Nathaniel’s voice dropped lower, thick with icy mockery.

Evelyn opened her mouth, frustration flickering in her eyes, but before she could respond, she heard the sound of a door opening. The next second, his tall frame strode into the room.

Their gazes locked, and Nathaniel ended the call first. He moved toward her with deliberate slowness, stopping just inches away, his presence overwhelming. "What about Thomas did you want to discuss?"

Evelyn averted her eyes, her voice barely above a whisper. "Charlotte is missing. I think Thomas might have taken her. Could you ask him about it?"

A faint smirk curled his lips, his piercing gaze boring into her with amusement and something far colder. "Evelyn, do I look like someone who does favors on demand?"

She frowned.

"Nathaniel, since Thomas is already engaged, he shouldn’t be bothering Charlotte. You’re his friend. A single call from you wouldn’t take much effort, but it would mean everything to me. If it wasn’t him, then something else must have happened, so—"

"Just because it’s a small favor, I should agree? What, are you trying to manipulate me now?"

"I’m not manipulating you. I’m asking for your help."

"Why should I help you?" Nathaniel countered, his voice dropping to a dangerous murmur.

His eyes narrowed slightly, his handsome face turning colder, more distant.

Evelyn fell silent.

He was right. He didn’t owe her anything.

He had every reason to refuse.

Then, Nathaniel took a step closer, his voice low and deliberate. "We’re about to divorce, and yet here you are, at my doorstep in the dead of night. Evelyn, it’s hard not to think you chose this timing because you wanted something to happen between us. Or do you not realize how easily things can spiral out of control when a man and a woman are alone at night?"

As he spoke, he leaned in slightly, his masculine scent enveloping her. Instinctively, Evelyn swayed back, but his lips hovered dangerously close to her cheek before he abruptly stopped.

Their faces were mere inches apart, his breath warm against her skin. He smirked. "So you did plan this, didn’t you?"

Evelyn’s eyes widened, and she stumbled back until the back of her knees hit the couch, forcing her to sit.

Her voice was steady but quiet. "I didn’t. I just—"

"Then leave. Now. Otherwise, don’t pretend this wasn’t intentional. Given our situation, I could still exercise my marital rights."
###Chapter 211

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She tapped her pencil absently against the blueprint, her mind elsewhere. Nathaniel had been distant lately, and she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Gregory. "Meeting in 15. Client wants revisions on the waterfront project."

Evelyn sighed. She hadn’t slept well, and the last thing she needed was another round of endless revisions. Still, she straightened her blouse and gathered her files.

Downstairs, the conference room was already half-full. Gregory shot her a knowing look as she slipped into her seat. "Late again, Mitchell?"

"Traffic," she lied smoothly.

The client, a sharp-eyed man named Sebastian Wilson, wasted no time. "The design lacks vision," he declared, flipping through the pages. "We need something bold—something that screams luxury."

Evelyn clenched her jaw. They’d been over this three times already. "With all due respect, Mr. Wilson, the current design balances aesthetics and functionality. Overcomplicating it risks—"

"Risk is what sells," he interrupted.

Across the table, Gabrielle, her assistant, gave her a subtle let it go look.

Evelyn exhaled. "Fine. We’ll revisit the concept."

After the meeting, Gregory pulled her aside. "You okay? You’ve been off your game."

"Just tired," she muttered.

He studied her for a moment. "This isn’t about work, is it? It’s Nathaniel."

Evelyn stiffened. "What about him?"

Gregory hesitated. "Look, I don’t want to stir anything up, but... Isabella’s back in town."

The name hit her like a punch. Isabella Davis—Nathaniel’s first love. The woman who’d left him years ago without a word.

Evelyn forced a smile. "So?"

Gregory shrugged. "Just thought you should know."

She waited until he was gone before letting her composure crack. Her phone buzzed again—Nathaniel.

"Dinner tonight? I’ll pick you up at 8."

Evelyn stared at the message, her fingers hovering over the screen. Was this just a coincidence? Or was something else going on?

She typed back, "Can’t wait."

But the knot in her stomach told her this dinner wouldn’t be as simple as it seemed.

Nathaniel didn’t spare her another glance. Without a word, he turned and strode upstairs, his broad shoulders rigid with tension.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. He was unwilling, and she had no leverage to change his mind.

But she didn’t leave. Instead, she retreated to the guest room on the first floor, sinking into the plush armchair by the window. Traveling alone at this hour wouldn’t have bothered her, but with the baby, she refused to take unnecessary risks.

She tried calling Charlotte again. Still no answer. If Thomas had intercepted her at the airport, he was serious. Only Nathaniel could sway him now.

Upstairs, Nathaniel knew she hadn’t left. From the balcony of his bedroom, he could see her car parked below, unmoving. He waited, arms crossed, for nearly half an hour before finally turning away, his jaw clenched.

The night passed in uneasy silence.

At dawn, Evelyn was already in the kitchen, the scent of freshly brewed coffee and sizzling bacon filling the air. Alfred, the butler, brightened at the sight of her. "Miss Evelyn, you should have rested longer."

"I’ve slept enough," she replied with a soft smile. "Alfred, what time does Nathaniel usually wake these days?"

"Varies. But he rarely eats breakfast here anymore. Comes home late, too." The older man hesitated before adding, "Perhaps because the house felt… empty without you."

Evelyn’s fingers stilled around the spatula, but she said nothing.

By 7:30 AM, the dining table was set. Nathaniel descended the stairs, his crisp white shirt immaculate, his expression unreadable. The sight of Evelyn in her usual seat—the one that had remained vacant for weeks—sent an unwelcome pang through him.

He ignored it.

Evelyn rose immediately, ladling soup into his bowl before resuming her seat. She was still searching for the right words when Nathaniel’s icy voice sliced through the silence.

"Evelyn, don’t bother pretending. I won’t be manipulated into helping Charlotte just because you’re playing the dutiful wife."

Her spoon clinked against the porcelain. "Then what would make you help me?"

His lips curled, though his eyes remained glacial. "Anything I want?"

She swallowed. "So if I… if we don’t divorce, you’ll intervene?"

Nathaniel laughed—a sharp, humorless sound.

It wasn’t that she’d guessed his thoughts. No, he was amused by her audacity.

His smile didn’t reach his eyes as he leaned forward, voice dangerously soft. "Evelyn, do you really think I’m so desperate to keep you that I’d bargain with you over this?"

Her throat tightened. "I didn’t mean—"

"You did." He cut her off, his tone frigid. "You assumed I’d cling to this marriage, even if it meant being manipulated. For Charlotte." He scoffed. "You never fail to surprise me."

Evelyn met his gaze, her own steady despite the ache in her chest. "I apologize for misreading you. I only wanted to show how serious this is. Charlotte’s safety—"

"Save it." Nathaniel pushed back from the table, his chair scraping against the floor. "Your priorities are your own problem."

He left without another word.


###Chapter 212

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She traced the sharp line of his jaw with her fingertips, a small smile playing on her lips.

The events of last night replayed in her mind—Isabella's sudden reappearance, the tension in the air, and the way Nathaniel had pulled her close afterward, whispering promises against her skin.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory: "Meeting at 10. Client wants revisions. Urgent."

Evelyn sighed. She had hoped for a quiet morning, but work never waited. Carefully, she slipped out of bed, grabbing her robe. The marble floor was cool beneath her bare feet as she padded to the bathroom.

The reflection in the mirror showed faint shadows under her eyes. Too much stress, she thought. Splashing cold water on her face, she willed herself to focus.

Downstairs, Alfred had already prepared her usual coffee—black, no sugar. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted, setting the cup before her.

"Morning, Alfred," she murmured, taking a sip. The bitter warmth grounded her.

The front door opened, and Samuel strode in, his expression tense. "Mr. Martin is needed at the office immediately," he said, glancing at the staircase. "There's an issue with the Prescott project."

Evelyn frowned. "What kind of issue?"

Samuel hesitated. "Legal complications. Mr. Sinclair is involved."

Her grip tightened around the cup. Donovan Sinclair. The name alone was trouble.

Footsteps sounded behind her. Nathaniel descended the stairs, already dressed in a crisp navy suit. His gaze locked onto Samuel. "Explain."

"The city council is questioning the permits. Sinclair's people are pushing back hard."

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. "I'll handle it." He turned to Evelyn, his voice softening. "Will you be alright?"

She forced a smile. "Go. I have my own fires to put out."

He kissed her forehead before leaving, Samuel trailing behind.

The silence that followed was heavy. Evelyn exhaled, reaching for her phone again. A missed call from Charlotte.

Before she could return it, another notification popped up—an email from Sebastian Wilson. The subject line made her blood run cold: "Mitchell Designs: Breach of Contract."

Her fingers trembled as she opened it.

"Due to unresolved design flaws in the Summit project, we are terminating our partnership effective immediately. Legal action will follow if reparations are not made within 48 hours."

Evelyn's breath hitched. This couldn't be happening. Not now.

A knock at the door interrupted her spiraling thoughts. Gabrielle stood there, her face pale. "Evelyn, you need to see this."

She handed over a tablet. The screen displayed a gossip column, a bold headline screaming: "Isabella Davis Spotted Leaving Martin Estate in the Dead of Night—Reconciliation in the Works?"

Beneath it was a blurry photo of Isabella stepping into a car, the timestamp reading 2:17 AM.

Evelyn's vision blurred.

The walls were closing in. The contracts, the rumors, the secrets—all of it crashing down at once.

And then, her phone rang again. Unknown number.

She answered, her voice barely steady. "Hello?"

A familiar, honeyed voice dripped through the line. "Evelyn, darling. Did you miss me?"

Isabella.

Evelyn's nails dug into her palm. "What do you want?"

A laugh, light and mocking. "Oh, just to talk. Meet me at the café on Fifth. Noon. Don't be late."

The call ended before Evelyn could respond.

She stared at the phone, her heart pounding.

This wasn't a coincidence.

It was a trap.

And she was walking right into it.

Evelyn remained frozen in her seat for what felt like hours, her mind swirling with turbulent thoughts. Every word Nathaniel spoke mirrored phrases she'd once thrown at him carelessly.

In the sprawling metropolis of Mayby, locating someone was like finding a needle in a haystack. As a newcomer with virtually no connections, Evelyn found even simple tasks daunting.

But Nathaniel Martin wasn't one to forgive easily. Reconciliation seemed impossible.

Drawing a steadying breath, Evelyn forced calm into her voice. "You're right. This was inappropriate of me. We're practically divorced, and Charlotte is my friend, not yours. You owe me nothing. I overstepped."

The logical part of her brain approved this self-admonishment. She couldn't keep relying on others - it would only lead to humiliation eventually.

Rising gracefully, Evelyn met Nathaniel's gaze. "I've lost my appetite. Excuse me."

She allowed herself one final lingering look before turning toward the exit.

Just as her hand touched the doorframe, his voice sliced through the air with surgical precision. "So I'm just a convenient tool to be discarded when useless?"

Evelyn's steps faltered.

Turning slightly, she saw Nathaniel still seated, his posture deceptively relaxed despite the edge in his tone.

"That's not what I meant," she countered.

"Then enlighten me. Do you think you can waltz in and out of my life as you please?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, brows knitting in frustration.

Then Nathaniel stood, his icy gaze sweeping over her before delivering his parting shot. "If you want my help with Thomas, you'll need to earn it."

With that, he strode past her toward the staircase.

Evelyn stood rooted in place, processing his words.

So there was a path forward.

A difficult one, certainly. But preferable to banging her head against bureaucratic walls with no guarantee of success.

A ghost of a smile touched her lips.

Uncertain how to "earn" Nathaniel's favor, Evelyn settled on the universal language of food. If she couldn't sweet-talk him, perhaps she could cook her way into his good graces.

Nathaniel remained sequestered upstairs all morning - not unusual for a Saturday when the office didn't demand his presence.

Evelyn enlisted Alfred's help to procure ingredients for her signature dishes, then disappeared into the kitchen for hours.

Upstairs in his study, Nathaniel sat reviewing contracts when Alfred entered with his customary coffee. As the butler turned to leave, Nathaniel's voice stopped him. "Where is she?"

No clarification needed.

"Miss Evelyn is preparing lunch, sir. She's insisted on handling everything personally - won't allow the kitchen staff to assist."

Nathaniel gave a noncommittal hum before resuming his paperwork.

The moment the door clicked shut, Nathaniel's focus shattered. Snatching his phone, he dialed a familiar number. When the call connected, his tone was deliberately casual. "What are you up to?"

The response came laced with amusement. "Should I be worried?"
###Chapter 213

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, her heart pounded erratically. The air was thick with tension, the kind that made her skin prickle with unease. She had expected a quiet evening with Nathaniel, but the sight before her shattered that illusion.

Isabella stood near the fireplace, her crimson dress clinging to her curves, a smirk playing on her lips. The way she leaned toward Nathaniel, whispering something in his ear, sent a sharp pang through Evelyn’s chest.

She shouldn’t be here.

Evelyn clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms. She had fought too hard, sacrificed too much, to let Isabella waltz back into their lives like this.

Nathaniel turned, his dark eyes locking onto hers. There was something unreadable in his gaze—guilt? Regret? Or worse, indifference?

"Evelyn," he said, his voice steady but distant.

She forced a smile, though it felt brittle. "Nathaniel. I didn’t realize we were expecting company."

Isabella’s laughter tinkled like broken glass. "Oh, don’t mind me. I was just catching up with an old friend."

Friend. The word tasted bitter.

Evelyn’s phone buzzed in her pocket. A message from Gregory: "We have a problem. The Summit Realty deal is falling apart. Call me ASAP."

Perfect. Just what she needed.

She excused herself, stepping into the hallway. The moment she was out of earshot, she dialed Gregory’s number.

"What happened?" she demanded.

"Sebastian Wilson pulled out," Gregory said, frustration lacing his tone. "He claims our designs don’t meet his vision. But I think someone got to him."

Evelyn’s mind raced. "Isabella?"

"Wouldn’t put it past her."

She exhaled sharply. "I’ll handle it."

As she ended the call, a shadow fell over her. She turned to find Nathaniel standing there, his expression unreadable.

"We need to talk," he said.

Her stomach twisted. She knew that tone. It never meant anything good.

"About?"

"About us."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. She had dreaded this moment for weeks.

But before she could respond, Alfred, the butler, appeared. "Mr. Martin, your grandfather is asking for you. Urgently."

Nathaniel hesitated, then nodded. "Later," he murmured before striding away.

Evelyn was left standing there, her heart in pieces.

And then, from the corner of her eye, she saw Isabella watching her, that same smug smile on her lips.

"Is Charlotte the woman who left you?" Nathaniel cut straight to the chase, his piercing gaze cold and unreadable.

Thomas hesitated for a split second. "You know about her?"

"Where is she now? With you?"

"Yes."

Nathaniel's voice was icy. "You'd better not mistreat her."

"Did Evelyn tell you?"

"This has nothing to do with Evelyn," Nathaniel countered, his dark eyes locked onto Thomas. A thought flickered through his mind—If I had known about Charlotte and Thomas sooner, would I have warned him earlier?

Downstairs, Evelyn had prepared an elaborate lunch, the aroma filling the air, making one's stomach growl in anticipation. She untied her apron and was about to head upstairs to call Nathaniel when the doorbell chimed.

The butler opened the door, revealing Isabella in a soft mint-green dress.

Her eyes widened slightly at the sight of Evelyn. After a quick glance around to confirm Nathaniel wasn’t present, she asked coolly, "What are you doing here?"

"That’s my line," Evelyn shot back, her tone frosty.

Isabella smirked. "You’re getting divorced from Nathaniel. Do you honestly think you still belong here? Tell me, Evelyn—do you regret it?"

"What business is it of yours?" Evelyn arched a brow. "Are you that desperate for me to leave? What if I decide to stay just to spite you?"

"You—" Isabella’s lips thinned in irritation, but she quickly masked it with a saccharine smile. "Do you really think Nathaniel would agree to that? Let’s see who ends up by his side in the end, shall we?"

Evelyn ignored her jab and turned toward the stairs—only to nearly collide with Nathaniel as he descended.

She met his gaze steadily. "Lunch is ready."

Before Nathaniel could respond, Isabella interjected, "Nathaniel, I need to speak with you. Alone."

His expression remained impassive. "About?"

"It’s private," Isabella insisted, casting a pointed look at Evelyn. "I doubt Evelyn would mind. After all, she knows what we mean to each other. If she had a problem with it, she would’ve stopped us by now."

The implication was clear—Evelyn was the unwanted third party.

Isabella turned to Evelyn with feigned innocence. "Don’t you agree?"

"Since when do you care about my opinion?" Evelyn replied flatly.

Isabella’s cheeks flushed. "Evelyn, I was just trying to be considerate. There’s no need to be so hostile!"

"Should I be sweet to you instead?" Evelyn’s eyes narrowed dangerously.

Isabella faltered, then lowered her voice. "Are you still upset about what happened on Nathaniel’s birthday?"

Evelyn let out a dry laugh. "Isabella, you should consider acting. You’d be brilliant at it."

Without another glance at Isabella, she focused on Nathaniel. "So—are we eating now, or do you need to have your private conversation first?"
###Chapter 214

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, she felt the weight of countless eyes on her. The air was thick with tension, the kind that made her fingers curl instinctively into fists. She had known this day would come—the day she would finally confront Isabella Davis, Nathaniel’s first love, the woman who had haunted their marriage like a ghost.

Isabella stood near the fireplace, her crimson dress clinging to her curves, her lips painted the same shade of red. She looked every bit the seductress Evelyn had imagined.

"Evelyn," Isabella purred, her voice dripping with false sweetness. "I was wondering when you’d show up."

Evelyn forced a smile, though her pulse hammered in her throat. "Isabella. I didn’t realize you were still in town."

"Oh, darling," Isabella laughed, twirling a strand of her golden hair around one finger. "I wouldn’t miss this for the world."

Nathaniel appeared at Evelyn’s side then, his hand settling possessively on the small of her back. His touch was warm, grounding, but Evelyn could feel the tension radiating off him.

"Isabella," he said, his voice cool. "I wasn’t aware you’d been invited."

Isabella’s smile faltered for just a second before she recovered. "Edward insisted I come. You know how fond he is of me."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. Edward Martin, Nathaniel’s grandfather, had always been kind to her, but his soft spot for Isabella was no secret.

Before the conversation could escalate, Gregory Wilson, Evelyn’s business partner, approached with two glasses of champagne. He handed one to Evelyn with a knowing look.

"You look like you could use this," he murmured.

Evelyn took the glass gratefully, her fingers brushing against his. "Thanks, Greg."

Isabella’s eyes flicked between them, a smirk playing on her lips. "How… cozy."

Nathaniel’s grip on Evelyn tightened slightly, but before he could respond, the sound of shattering glass cut through the room.

All heads turned toward the commotion.

Victoria Martin, Nathaniel’s mother, stood frozen, her champagne flute in pieces at her feet. Her face was pale as she stared at someone across the room.

Evelyn followed her gaze—and her breath caught.

Standing near the entrance was Richard Martin, Nathaniel’s father, a man who had been absent from their lives for years.

The room fell into stunned silence.

Then Richard smiled, slow and deliberate, his eyes locking onto Victoria’s.

"Hello, Lily," he said, using her old nickname. "Did you miss me?"

Victoria swayed slightly, her hand flying to her chest.

Evelyn felt Nathaniel stiffen beside her.

The game had just changed.

And none of them were ready for what came next.

Nathaniel's gaze flickered toward Evelyn, but before he could utter a word, Isabella interjected, "Nathaniel, I need to discuss something with you. About last year."

His brows knitted together, his dark eyes turning stormy.

Without another glance at Evelyn, he said curtly, "Go ahead and eat." Then he strode toward the living room.

Isabella shot Evelyn a triumphant smirk, as if declaring, See? He still chooses me. You’ll always be second.

Evelyn remained rooted in place, watching them disappear into the other room. She wasn’t curious about their conversation—just hollow.

A bitter voice whispered in her mind, No matter what, he’ll always pick her in the end.

Nathaniel stood rigidly by the window, his expression unreadable as he faced Isabella. "Speak. What is it?"

His tone was clipped, impatient.

Lately, he had been distant—ignoring her calls during business trips, avoiding her presence. Isabella could feel him slipping away, and fear coiled in her chest.

She swallowed hard. "Nathaniel, I want us to take wedding photos."

Silence.

She stepped closer, desperation lacing her words. "Just one set. I know you won’t divorce Evelyn, and maybe what you feel for me is just guilt. But marrying you—it’s all I’ve dreamed of since you promised me. Please, grant me this one thing."

When he didn’t respond, she rushed on, "I swear, if you agree, I’ll cooperate fully with the therapist. I’ll let go of the past. I’ll say goodbye to you—properly this time."

Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears, her voice trembling with raw emotion.

Nathaniel remained unmoved. "Do you really think wedding photos will fix anything?"

"Yes," she insisted. "It’ll be closure. You won’t have to divorce her, and I’ll have my dream fulfilled. After this, I’ll disappear from your life. I know being with you is impossible, but just this once—let me pretend."

Her lips quivered, her delicate fingers twisting together. She looked heartbreakingly fragile.

Nathaniel’s expression didn’t soften. "Are you certain this is what you want?"

"More than anything."

"Then why waste time on meaningless photos?"

"Because loving you has been my entire life," she whispered. "I just need this one memory."

His jaw tightened. "Legally, Evelyn is still my wife. Do you honestly think this is appropriate?"

Isabella’s eyes flashed. "Why wouldn’t it be? Unless—" Her voice turned sharp. "Have you fallen for her? But she doesn’t love you. She’s only here because of the family alliance—"

"Enough." Nathaniel’s voice was lethal, his gaze piercing. "If you truly understand the situation, make another request. I’ll grant it—within reason."

Her shoulders slumped. "This is all I want."

"Then I refuse."

"Why?"
###Chapter 215

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, she felt the weight of countless eyes on her. The air was thick with tension, the kind that made her fingers curl instinctively into fists. She had known this confrontation was inevitable, but facing Nathaniel’s family—especially after everything that had happened—was far from easy.

Nathaniel stood beside her, his presence steady and reassuring. His hand brushed against hers, a silent promise that he wouldn’t let her face this alone. But Evelyn knew better. No matter how much he shielded her, the Martins had their own opinions, and they weren’t known for holding back.

Edward Martin, Nathaniel’s grandfather, sat at the head of the long dining table, his sharp gaze assessing her with unnerving precision. Richard and Victoria, Nathaniel’s parents, flanked him, their expressions unreadable.

"You’re late," Edward remarked, his voice cool.

Nathaniel didn’t flinch. "Traffic."

A lie. They both knew it. They’d spent an extra twenty minutes arguing in the car—Evelyn insisting she wasn’t ready, Nathaniel refusing to let her back out.

Victoria’s lips thinned. "We were beginning to think you’d changed your mind about joining us."

Evelyn forced a polite smile. "I wouldn’t miss it."

The words tasted bitter. She had considered skipping this dinner, but Nathaniel had been adamant. "They need to see us together," he’d said. "They need to understand this is real."

As if sensing her unease, Nathaniel’s fingers intertwined with hers under the table. The gesture was small, but it grounded her.

Richard cleared his throat. "So, Evelyn. Nathaniel tells us you’ve been working on a new project?"

She nodded, grateful for the neutral topic. "Yes, a sustainable housing development in the city’s east district. It’s still in the early stages, but we’re hoping to break ground by next quarter."

Edward’s brows lifted slightly. "Ambitious."

"It is," she agreed. "But necessary."

A flicker of approval crossed his face before he turned his attention to Nathaniel. "And how does this affect your responsibilities at Martin Group?"

Nathaniel didn’t miss a beat. "It doesn’t. Evelyn’s work is her own. My focus remains on the company."

Evelyn resisted the urge to roll her eyes. The Martins loved their power plays, and Edward was testing them—seeing if Nathaniel would prioritize her over the family business.

The rest of the dinner passed in a blur of polite conversation and veiled jabs. By the time dessert was served, Evelyn’s nerves were frayed.

Then Edward set down his fork and looked directly at her. "Tell me, Evelyn. Do you truly believe you’re what’s best for my grandson?"

The room fell silent.

Nathaniel stiffened beside her, but Evelyn met Edward’s gaze head-on. "That’s not for me to decide," she said calmly. "But I love him. And I won’t walk away just because it’s inconvenient for your family."

A beat of silence. Then, to her surprise, Edward chuckled. "Good answer."

Nathaniel exhaled slowly, his grip on her hand tightening.

But as Evelyn glanced around the table, she caught the storm brewing in Victoria’s eyes. This wasn’t over. Not by a long shot.

And when Isabella’s name was mentioned in passing—a casual remark about her latest charity event—Evelyn felt the temperature in the room drop.

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched. "Isabella isn’t relevant to this conversation."

Victoria smiled thinly. "Isn’t she?"

Evelyn’s stomach twisted.

The game had just begun.

"No reason. I simply find it unnecessary," Nathaniel replied coldly, his tone leaving no room for further discussion with Isabella.

His indifference made her hesitate, her confidence wavering for the first time.

"I just think it's unnecessary."

Those words shattered whatever restraint Isabella had left. Tears spilled freely down her cheeks, her voice trembling with desperation. "Nathaniel, were you just waiting for me to give up? The moment I say it's over, you'd walk away without a second thought, wouldn't you?"

Nathaniel remained silent, letting her vent her frustration.

Isabella continued, her voice breaking, "Why can't you just agree? If you don’t love Evelyn, why stay married to her? It was me who met you first. Me who sacrificed everything for you. How could you just throw me away like this?"

Her emotions spiraled—tears, anger, accusations—yet Nathaniel stood unmoved, his expression as cold and unreadable as the Arctic depths.

"Isabella, you're not thinking clearly. We'll talk when you've calmed down. If you’re willing to adjust your demands, I’ll do what I can. But if you insist on this path, then I’m sorry. I can’t give you what you want."

With that, he turned to leave.

Isabella’s composure snapped. She lunged forward, wrapping her arms around him in a desperate embrace. "Nathaniel, how can you be so cruel?"

Nathaniel stiffened, his jaw tightening. Without hesitation, he pried her off, his voice sharp. "Isabella, control yourself."

She shook her head, her vision blurred with tears. Then, from the corner of her eye, she saw Evelyn approaching from the foyer.

Seizing the moment, Isabella grabbed Nathaniel’s face, pulling him toward her as if to kiss him.

Nathaniel recoiled instantly, his expression darkening. He glared down at her, his patience clearly at its limit.

Evelyn stood at the threshold of the living room, her sleeves rolled up to her elbows, revealing the graceful lines of her forearms. She watched them with detached amusement, her gaze flickering between them like a spectator at a play.

A faint smirk curved her lips as she said, "My apologies. I didn’t mean to interrupt."

Nathaniel’s eyes locked onto her. She stood perfectly still, her smile not quite reaching her cold, unreadable eyes.

When their gazes met, Evelyn held it for only a second before looking away. Then, she turned her attention to Isabella, who wore a triumphant smirk.

Evelyn felt nothing.

Without waiting for a response, she shrugged. "Don’t let me stop you. I’ll be in the dining room."

She turned on her heel and walked away, leaving Nathaniel staring after her, his frown deepening.

Isabella clutched at his sleeve, whispering urgently, "See? She doesn’t care about you. If she loved you, she wouldn’t just walk away like that. She—"

"Enough, Isabella." Nathaniel’s voice cut through her words like ice. "Must you humiliate us both before you’re satisfied?"

His sharp tone froze her in place.



###Chapter 216

The moment Nathaniel stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, the air shifted. His presence commanded attention, his sharp gaze scanning the room before landing on Evelyn. She stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, the golden afternoon light casting a soft glow around her.

"You're late," she remarked without turning, her voice cool but laced with something unspoken.

Nathaniel exhaled, loosening his tie. "Traffic."

Evelyn finally turned, her eyes narrowing slightly. "Traffic? Or another meeting with her?"

The tension between them crackled like static. Nathaniel clenched his jaw, his patience thinning. "Isabella was at the office. It was business."

"Business," Evelyn repeated, her tone dripping with skepticism. She crossed her arms, the diamond on her finger catching the light—a stark reminder of the vows they had taken. "Funny how your business always seems to involve her."

Nathaniel took a step forward, his voice lowering. "Evelyn, we’ve been over this. There’s nothing between us anymore."

"Then why does it feel like she’s still in our marriage?" Evelyn shot back, her voice trembling with suppressed emotion.

Before Nathaniel could respond, the door swung open, and Alfred, their butler, cleared his throat. "Mr. Martin, your grandfather requests your presence in the study."

Nathaniel hesitated, his eyes locked with Evelyn’s. "We’re not done here."

Evelyn lifted her chin. "No, we’re not."

As Nathaniel strode out, Evelyn turned back to the window, her reflection betraying the turmoil inside. She had known marrying into the Martin family wouldn’t be easy, but she hadn’t anticipated the ghosts of Nathaniel’s past haunting them at every turn.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Gregory. "The client approved the final design. We’re moving forward."

A small victory, but one that felt hollow. She typed a quick reply, then tossed her phone onto the couch. Outside, the gardens stretched endlessly, meticulously maintained yet devoid of warmth—much like her marriage.

She had fought too hard to let Isabella—or anyone—destroy what she and Nathaniel had built. But as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the room, Evelyn couldn’t shake the feeling that the real battle was just beginning.

And this time, she wasn’t sure if love alone would be enough.

Isabella's voice trembled as she asked, "Nathaniel, if not for what happened last year, would you have cut me out of your life long ago?"

Nathaniel didn’t answer. His icy gaze was answer enough.

Isabella swallowed hard, her eyes glistening. "Right. I see now."

She pressed a hand to her lips and fled, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

Nathaniel didn’t follow. Didn’t even call after her.

He stood rooted in place, jaw clenched, wrestling with the storm inside him.

By the time he returned to the dining room, Evelyn was already seated, her posture rigid.

Their eyes met briefly before she looked away, picking up her fork. "We should eat. The food’s getting cold."

No warmth in her tone. No questions.

Nathaniel took his seat across from her. Silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating.

When the meal ended, Evelyn finally spoke. "Nathaniel, will you help me now?"

He leaned back, wiping his hands with deliberate slowness. Then, his voice dangerously calm, he asked, "What do you think of what Isabella just did?"

Evelyn froze. The memory of Isabella pressing her lips to his flashed in her mind.

She hadn’t seen it clearly—only heard their argument, Isabella’s desperate sobs. But the implication was obvious.

Of course they kissed. He loves her. He always has.

Her chest ached. Why was he asking her this?

Was he testing her? Seeing if she’d play the understanding wife?

She forced a smile, nails digging into her palms. "That’s between you and Isabella. It’s not my place to comment." She paused. "But don’t worry. I won’t interfere."

Nathaniel’s laugh was sharp. "How generous of you." His eyes burned into hers. "Should I applaud? Maybe award you ‘Most Tolerant Wife’?"

Evelyn’s mask didn’t crack. "Did I say something wrong?"

You’re the one who taught me to stay out of it. To know my place. And now you’re angry?

Nathaniel shoved his chair back. "You’re never wrong. It’s always me."

He turned to leave.

Evelyn shot up, blocking his path. "Nathaniel, I don’t understand. You made it clear your relationship with Isabella is private. I respected that. So why are you furious now?"

His jaw tightened, veins standing out along his neck.

When he spoke, his voice was rough. "If you want my help finding Charlotte, prove you mean it. You think one meal is enough?" His smile was cold. "My cooperation doesn’t come that cheap."
###Chapter 217

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, she felt the weight of countless eyes on her. The air was thick with tension, the kind that made her fingers curl into fists at her sides. She had known this meeting wouldn’t be easy, but the hostility radiating from Nathaniel’s mother, Victoria, was sharper than she’d anticipated.

“You’re late,” Victoria remarked coolly, her gaze sweeping over Evelyn with barely concealed disdain.

Evelyn forced a polite smile. “My apologies. There was an unexpected delay at the construction site.”

Nathaniel stepped forward, his presence a silent shield. “Mother, we’ve discussed this. Evelyn’s work is important.”

Victoria’s lips thinned, but before she could retort, Edward Martin, Nathaniel’s grandfather, cleared his throat from his seat at the head of the table. “Let’s not waste time with trivialities. We have matters to discuss.”

The room fell silent, the tension shifting into something heavier. Evelyn took her seat beside Nathaniel, her pulse quickening. She knew what was coming.

Edward folded his hands on the table, his sharp eyes locking onto Evelyn. “The board has raised concerns about your recent project, Evelyn. The delays and budget overruns are unacceptable.”

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. “With all due respect, Mr. Martin, the delays were caused by unforeseen structural issues. We’ve already adjusted the plans to stay within budget.”

“That’s not what the reports say,” Richard Martin, Nathaniel’s father, interjected, his tone clipped.

Nathaniel’s hand found Evelyn’s under the table, his fingers lacing with hers in silent support. “Father, if you’d actually reviewed the updated reports, you’d see the progress we’ve made.”

Victoria scoffed. “Progress? Or excuses?”

Evelyn inhaled sharply, her patience wearing thin. She met Victoria’s gaze head-on. “I understand your concerns, Mrs. Martin, but I assure you, this project will be completed on time and to the highest standard.”

Edward studied her for a long moment before nodding. “Very well. But if there are any further setbacks, we’ll have no choice but to reconsider your involvement.”

The unspoken threat hung in the air. Evelyn swallowed hard but refused to back down. “Understood.”

As the meeting adjourned, Nathaniel pulled her aside, his voice low. “Ignore them. They’re just trying to intimidate you.”

Evelyn exhaled shakily. “It’s working.”

He cupped her face, his thumb brushing her cheek. “You’re stronger than this. And you’re not alone.”

She leaned into his touch, drawing strength from his words. But as she glanced over his shoulder, she caught Isabella Davis watching them from across the room, her expression unreadable.

A chill ran down Evelyn’s spine.

Something told her the real battle was just beginning.

"So what exactly do you expect from me?" Nathaniel's voice was dangerously calm, his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn. "Should I stay married to you so you can hide behind our union while you scheme with Isabella? Or perhaps you'd prefer to bear my child, only to raise it as if it were hers?"

Evelyn felt the sting of his words like a slap. Her fingers curled into fists, nails digging into her palms. She met his eyes, her own burning with defiance. "I'm only stating facts, Nathaniel."

A cold, humorless laugh escaped him. "You've grown bold, Evelyn. Bold enough to test my patience."

Anyone else might have mistaken his composed expression for indifference, but Evelyn knew better. The air around him crackled with suppressed fury.

She tilted her chin up. "I'm not testing anything. I'm just being honest."

"Are you finished?" His voice was low, edged with warning.

Evelyn didn’t respond. She simply held his gaze, her silence speaking volumes.

"Good," he said, his tone glacial. "Then get out of my sight."

The command was final, leaving no room for argument.

She knew what it meant—disappearing from his life, if only for tonight. But she couldn’t leave yet. Not without answers.

Evelyn swallowed hard. "When will you speak to Thomas?"

His lips curved into a mocking smile. "Ah, so this is about my help?" He stepped closer, his towering frame casting a shadow over her. "Let me make myself clear. I’m not in the mood for your demands. Do you understand?"

"You're going back on your word," she accused, her voice trembling.

"Did I ever promise you anything?" he countered smoothly.

Evelyn inhaled sharply. He was right. He hadn’t. She had been foolish to pin all her hopes on him.

A bitter smile touched her lips. "You’re right. You never promised me anything. This was my mistake."

His expression remained unreadable. "Now that we’ve settled that, leave."

She hesitated, but there was nothing left to say.

She had been wrong. Wrong to trust him. Wrong to believe he would ever care.

Clenching her jaw, she turned and walked away, the weight of his dismissal pressing down on her. She barely remembered how she made it out of Pineview Villa. All she could see was Nathaniel’s cold, detached expression burned into her mind.

Back at her apartment, Evelyn forced a smile as Beatrice studied her. "Evelyn, dear, did something happen between you and Nathaniel?"

Evelyn knew exactly who she meant. She shook her head lightly. "No, Grandma. It’s nothing like that."

Beatrice hesitated before asking, "Are you still planning to divorce him?"

The question hung in the air. Evelyn exhaled, keeping her voice steady. "Don’t worry about me. I’ll be fine. Just focus on taking care of yourself."

Beatrice nodded, sensing her granddaughter didn’t want to talk about it.

Later that evening, after ensuring Beatrice had eaten, Evelyn retreated to her own apartment across the hall. The silence was suffocating.

Charlotte had stayed with her for a few days, filling the space with laughter and chatter. Now, the emptiness was unbearable.

Evelyn sank onto the sofa, staring blankly at the wall. After a long moment, she reached for her phone and dialed a familiar number.

Just as she thought it would go to voicemail, the call connected.

"Evelyn?" Thomas’s warm voice greeted her.

"It’s me," she said softly. "Do you have time to talk?"



###Chapter 218

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers danced over the blueprints, tracing the lines of what would soon become Martin Group's newest luxury resort. The project had consumed her for weeks, but today, something else weighed heavily on her mind.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Nathaniel.

"Meeting at the penthouse. 7 PM. Wear the black dress."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. The black dress. The one he had bought her for their anniversary. The one that hugged every curve, making her feel both powerful and vulnerable in his presence. She knew what this meant—another high-stakes business dinner, another night of playing the perfect wife in front of investors who still doubted her place beside him.

She glanced at the clock. Four hours left.

A knock at the door interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, stepped in, holding a steaming cup of coffee. "You look like you need this," she said with a knowing smile.

Evelyn accepted it gratefully. "Thanks. Any updates on the Henderson account?"

Gabrielle shook her head. "Still waiting on their final approval. But Gregory called—he said the structural revisions are ready for review."

Evelyn nodded absently, her mind already drifting back to Nathaniel. Lately, their interactions had been… different. Colder. Ever since Isabella had resurfaced, slithering back into their lives with her calculated smiles and veiled threats.

She took a sip of coffee, the bitterness grounding her.

No. She wouldn’t let Isabella get under her skin. Not again.

Her phone buzzed once more—this time, a call from an unknown number.

Evelyn hesitated before answering. "Hello?"

A familiar, honeyed voice dripped through the receiver. "Evelyn. It’s been too long."

Her grip tightened around the phone. Isabella.

"I thought we should talk," Isabella continued, her tone deceptively light. "Before tonight’s little… gathering."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. "What do you want?"

A soft laugh. "Oh, nothing much. Just a friendly warning. You see, some things never change. And Nathaniel… well, he always had a soft spot for me."

The line went dead.

Evelyn stared at the phone, her breath coming faster.

Tonight wasn’t just another dinner.

It was a battlefield.

And Isabella had just declared war.

Thomas's voice was cool as he answered, "What is it?"

"Is Charlotte with you?" Evelyn cut straight to the point. She hadn't called to exchange pleasantries—she needed answers.

A low chuckle came through the line. "I have no idea what you're talking about."

"Whether you're playing dumb or genuinely clueless," Evelyn exhaled sharply, fingers tightening around her phone, "if you're keeping her locked up, it won't stay hidden for long. If this is just revenge, then congratulations—you've succeeded. But if you actually care about her, you're destroying her."

Silence.

That was all the confirmation Evelyn needed. Her shoulders relaxed slightly.

She didn’t wait for a response. "Whatever happened between you two, just talk to her. Don’t hurt her."

Thomas laughed, the sound darkly amused. "You and Nathaniel really are made for each other."

"Excuse me?"

Evelyn’s brows knitted together. What did Nathaniel have to do with this?

"Nothing."

Thomas ended the conversation there, but Evelyn couldn’t shake the thought. Did Nathaniel say something to him?

She rubbed her temples, frustration bubbling up. The more she tried to make sense of it, the more tangled it became. Eventually, she gave up. Maybe I’m overcomplicating things.

For a fleeting moment, she wondered if Nathaniel had already intervened.

But he made it clear he wouldn’t help me. Why would he?

Her thoughts were interrupted by her phone buzzing—an incoming call from Dattlech.

Her stomach dropped.

The voice on the other end was deep, laced with concern. "Evelyn, it’s Alexander. Charlotte’s phone is off. Where is she?"

Evelyn’s fingers trembled slightly. "Oh, her phone broke. She hasn’t replaced it yet, so it’s been shut off. She’s staying with my grandmother right now. Do you want me to have her call you?"

"No, no. I just wanted to check. Couldn’t reach her, so I thought I’d ask you."

"She’s fine," Evelyn said smoothly, forcing calm into her voice. "Don’t worry."

"Thank you."

"Of course. Charlotte and I are close—you know that."

And because Alexander did know, he didn’t press further.

The moment the call ended, Evelyn dropped her phone onto the table, tension coiling in her chest.

If I can’t find Charlotte soon, Alexander will start asking real questions. But Thomas isn’t budging, and I have no idea what’s happening to her.

The night lights of Mayby glittered like scattered diamonds. Less than thirty minutes from Pineview Villa, in an exclusive gated community, Charlotte lay asleep in a lavish bedroom.

The door creaked open.

Thomas stepped inside, his movements deliberate. He tugged at his tie, tossing it aside before approaching the bed.

A kiss—deep, suffocating—dragged Charlotte from sleep. She gasped, fighting against the weight pressing her down.

Her eyes flew open.

Thomas loomed over her, his expression unreadable.

She glared. "Is this all you can do, Thomas? Lock me up like some prisoner? What kind of man hides a woman away?"

His fingers tightened on her chin. "You’re right. I’m not strong enough to let you go. Should I give you another chance to run?"

Charlotte’s voice turned venomous. "You disgust me. You have a fiancée, yet here you are, clinging to me like some pathetic—"

He cut her off with another kiss, rougher this time.

And Charlotte?

She bit down. Hard.
###Chapter 219

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn’s office, casting a golden glow over the blueprints spread across her desk. She traced a finger along the sketched lines of the new resort project, her mind already racing with adjustments. The phone buzzed, pulling her from her thoughts.

Nathaniel’s name flashed on the screen.

Her heart skipped. They hadn’t spoken since their argument last night—another clash about Isabella’s sudden reappearance in their lives.

She hesitated before answering. “Nathaniel.”

His voice was low, strained. “Evelyn, we need to talk.”

A knot twisted in her stomach. She knew that tone. “About what?”

“Not over the phone.” He exhaled sharply. “Meet me at the penthouse. One hour.”

Before she could respond, the line went dead.

Evelyn stared at her phone, dread creeping in. Something was wrong.

Her assistant, Gabrielle, peeked in. “Everything okay?”

“No.” Evelyn shoved her chair back, grabbing her blazer. “Reschedule my afternoon meetings.”

Gabrielle’s brows furrowed. “But the client presentation—”

“Handle it.” Evelyn was already halfway out the door.

The penthouse elevator ride felt endless.

She stepped into the foyer, the silence thick. Nathaniel stood by the window, his back to her, shoulders tense.

“What’s going on?” she asked.

He turned slowly, his expression unreadable. “Isabella’s pregnant.”

The words hit like a punch. Evelyn’s breath caught. “What?”

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. “She claims it’s mine.”

Evelyn’s hands trembled. “And you believe her?”

“I don’t know.” He raked a hand through his hair. “But she’s demanding a paternity test.”

The room spun. Evelyn gripped the back of the sofa to steady herself. This couldn’t be happening.

Nathaniel stepped closer, his voice rough. “Evelyn, I need you to trust me.”

She met his gaze, her own burning with unshed tears. “Then tell me the truth. Did you sleep with her?”

His silence was answer enough.

Her heart shattered.

The penthouse door burst open.

Isabella strode in, her designer dress hugging her frame, a smirk playing on her lips. “Oh, good. You’re both here.”

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms. “Get out.”

Isabella ignored her, tossing a folder onto the coffee table. “Test results. Congratulations, Nathaniel. You’re going to be a father.”

Nathaniel paled.

Evelyn’s vision blurred.

The walls closed in.

Then—black.

Charlotte Bennett was confined to a gilded cage—a luxurious bedroom where she'd been held since being whisked away from the airport. Three times a day, a silent maid delivered meals, but the doors remained locked. Resigned, Charlotte stopped wasting energy on futile escape plans.

What she couldn’t tolerate was Thomas Ellsworth treating her like some deranged captive.

Her sharp retorts only amused him. With a dark chuckle, he murmured, "You’ve experienced firsthand whether I’m a real man. Since I repulse you so much, what’s a few more times?"

He didn’t stop.

At first, Charlotte fought back—hissing curses, clawing at him—but soon, her voice shattered into breathless silence.

Hours later, Thomas carried her to the shower, then back to bed. He pulled her against his chest, his arms a possessive cage. Just as his breathing evened out, Charlotte kicked him hard.

"Are you done?" she spat. "Or is your fiancée so inadequate that you’re this desperate?"

Thomas’s grip tightened. "Still feisty. If you’re not tired, we can continue."

Charlotte clenched her teeth and went rigid, enduring his embrace.

But sleep never came. That night, she drowned in the same nightmare—a faceless woman whispering cruelly: "You’re just a foster child, Charlotte. Beneath him. Leave, or you’ll always be his dirty secret."

Morning light spilled into Evelyn Mitchell’s penthouse. She dressed swiftly, ready to meet her grandmother Beatrice for breakfast.

Just as she reached for the door, her phone buzzed.

Samuel Yates.

Evelyn’s stomach knotted. She answered.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin," Samuel said smoothly. "Mr. Martin requests your presence at Martin Group headquarters. Regarding the Phoenix Project."

Her pulse jumped. "What about it?"

"You’ll need to discuss the details with him directly. But it involves... reactivation."

Reactivate the project. The words sent a thrill through her. This could solve everything.

After a quick breakfast with Beatrice, Evelyn drove straight to the Martin Group’s gleaming tower. Samuel met her at the elevator—but instead of leading her to Nathaniel’s office, he guided her to the conference room.

"Where’s Nathaniel?" Evelyn frowned. "I thought we were renegotiating terms."

"Mr. Martin is occupied. I’ll brief you first."

Samuel slid a contract across the table. Evelyn scanned the clauses, then froze.

"I’m taking full control? What about Summit Realty?"

"Mr. Martin believes too many stakeholders complicate things. Summit has withdrawn. Their prior contributions will be compensated, but from today onward..." Samuel’s gaze sharpened. "You steer this ship. Do you accept?"

Evelyn’s fingers traced the embossed Martin Group logo. "I need to speak with Nathaniel."


###Chapter 220

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

She sighed, sitting up and running a hand through her tousled hair. The silence of the mansion was deafening. Even Alfred, their ever-attentive butler, moved about with quiet efficiency, as if afraid to disturb the fragile peace.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory.

"Evelyn, the client wants revisions by noon. Can you come in early?"

She groaned. Another day of endless meetings and impossible deadlines. But at least work kept her mind off the growing distance between her and Nathaniel.

Downstairs, Rosalind had prepared breakfast—fluffy pancakes with fresh berries, just the way Evelyn liked them. But the food tasted like ash in her mouth.

"Morning, Mrs. Martin," Rosalind greeted cheerfully. "Coffee?"

"Please." Evelyn forced a smile.

As she sipped her coffee, her phone buzzed again. This time, it was Charlotte.

"Girl, we need to talk. Lunch today?"

Evelyn hesitated. She had a mountain of work waiting, but the thought of confiding in her best friend was too tempting.

"Fine. But make it quick."

She grabbed her bag and headed out, the weight of unspoken words pressing heavily on her chest.

Meanwhile, across town, Nathaniel sat in his office, staring blankly at the financial reports in front of him. Samuel cleared his throat.

"Sir, the board is expecting your decision on the merger by the end of the day."

Nathaniel barely glanced up. "Tell them I need more time."

Samuel hesitated. "They won’t like that."

"I don’t care."

The door opened, and Isabella walked in, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

"Busy?" she asked, her voice dripping with false sweetness.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "What do you want?"

She smirked. "Just checking in. You’ve been… distant lately."

He didn’t respond.

Isabella leaned against his desk, her perfume overwhelming. "You know, Evelyn doesn’t appreciate you. Not like I do."

Nathaniel finally looked up, his eyes cold. "Get out."

She laughed, unfazed. "You’ll come around."

As she sauntered out, Nathaniel exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. He reached for his phone, thumb hovering over Evelyn’s contact.

But he didn’t call.

Instead, he stood and walked to the window, watching the city below.

Somewhere out there, Evelyn was doing the same.

And neither of them knew how to bridge the gap.


Samuel checked his wristwatch with a quick glance. "I'm afraid that won't be possible at the moment. Mr. Martin is currently occupied with a high-profile client."

"That's fine. I can wait."

"Very well."

Evelyn trailed behind Samuel as they exited the conference room, settling into the plush seating of the executive lounge. Just as they approached the secretary's office, the heavy oak door to Nathaniel's private suite swung open. A striking woman with an air of effortless confidence stepped out, her crimson lips curved in a knowing smile. Close behind her, Nathaniel appeared, his expression unreadable but his posture relaxed as they exchanged quiet words.

The woman—Scarlett Cronin—tilted her head, her fingers brushing lightly against Nathaniel's forearm. "So, drinks tonight? Just us. No excuses."

Nathaniel didn’t pull away, merely arching a brow. "I'll have my driver take you back to The Grand. As for drinks... another time."

Scarlett let out a soft, amused huff but didn’t argue. "Fine. But I expect better hospitality next time."

"Elevator?" Nathaniel offered, gesturing down the hall.

"Only if you escort me personally."

They moved past Evelyn without so much as a glance in her direction, though Scarlett’s gaze flickered toward her for the briefest second—long enough to leave a smirk in its wake.

Evelyn’s fingers curled into her palms.

Who is she? The question burned at the back of her throat. How well does Nathaniel know her?

She exhaled sharply, forcing her shoulders to relax as she took a seat in the lounge. But the tension lingered, coiling tight in her chest.

Nathaniel walked Scarlett to the elevator bank, his hands tucked casually into his pockets.

"That was your wife, wasn’t it?" Scarlett mused, tapping a manicured nail against the elevator button.

Nathaniel’s silence was answer enough.

"She’s lovely," Scarlett continued, undeterred. "Though I suspect she’s not the type to forgive easily. Am I right?"

Nathaniel shot her a warning look. "What’s your point?"

Scarlett laughed. "My point, darling, is that if you keep treating her with the same warmth you reserve for business associates, you’ll be back on the market sooner than you think."

The elevator doors slid open.

"Goodbye, Nathaniel." She stepped inside, flashing him one last grin before the doors sealed shut.

Nathaniel exhaled through his nose, turning on his heel.

When he returned to the lounge, Evelyn was already on her feet, her posture rigid. Their eyes met—hers guarded, his unreadable.

Then, deliberately calm, she spoke.

"Nathaniel, I need to discuss the project with you. Do you have time now?"
###Chapter 221

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel lay still, his breathing steady. She studied his profile—the sharp angle of his jaw, the faint scar near his temple from a childhood accident. Even in sleep, he carried an air of quiet authority.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory: "Meeting moved to 10 AM. Client wants revisions."

Evelyn sighed. She had hoped for a slow morning, but work never waited. Carefully, she slipped out of bed, careful not to disturb Nathaniel.

Downstairs, Alfred had already prepared coffee. The rich aroma filled the kitchen. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted.

"Morning, Alfred," she murmured, wrapping her hands around the warm mug.

The doorbell rang. Alfred moved to answer it, returning with a courier holding a sleek black envelope. Evelyn frowned as she took it. The weight of the paper felt ominous.

Inside was an invitation—gold-embossed lettering on thick cardstock.

"The Annual Martin Charity Gala. Black Tie Required."

Her stomach twisted. The last time she attended one of these events, Isabella had made a scene, whispering poison in Nathaniel’s ear.

Alfred cleared his throat. "Mr. Martin mentioned you might need a new gown for the occasion."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Of course."

As she sipped her coffee, her phone buzzed again. This time, it was Charlotte.

"Emergency brunch. Now. You won’t believe what I just heard."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. Charlotte never exaggerated.

She set down her mug. "Alfred, tell Nathaniel I had to leave early. Work emergency."

Outside, the city hummed with life. But Evelyn couldn’t shake the feeling that something—or someone—was about to turn her world upside down again.

Nathaniel didn't respond right away. His piercing gaze lingered on Evelyn, searching for any hint of deception, but her expression remained unreadable.

With a derisive scoff, he finally spoke. "If I refuse, will you just walk away?"

Evelyn frowned, baffled by his sudden irritation. This was their first exchange today, and already, it felt like he couldn’t stand the sound of her voice.

She fell silent, and after a frosty glance, Nathaniel strode toward his office. Evelyn trailed behind, keeping a respectful distance.

Once inside, she hesitated before asking softly, "Have you truly made up your mind about cutting Summit Realty from the project?"

Nathaniel lit a cigarette, the flame flickering briefly before he exhaled a thin stream of smoke. "Summit Realty hasn’t contributed anything substantial. They’ve already taken their share. The project no longer concerns them. That’s the rule."

Evelyn stayed where she was, unwilling to step closer through the haze. To Nathaniel, her reluctance felt deliberate.

His jaw tightened, the sharp angles of his face growing more pronounced.

Through the curling smoke, Evelyn met his gaze. "Should I inform them, or will you handle it?"

"Samuel will deal with it," Nathaniel replied curtly. "Your focus should be on your work. Since you’re reporting directly to me now, you’ll follow Martin Group’s protocols. Daily progress reports. Tangible results. Understood?"

Evelyn’s brows knitted in surprise. The project was already past its critical phase—why did he suddenly need daily updates? He wasn’t even overseeing it directly.

Nathaniel seemed to read her thoughts. "This is my top priority this quarter. Whatever happened before doesn’t matter. Now that it’s restarting, I expect your full commitment."

"Fine. I understand." She nodded, deciding not to press further. If Samuel was handling Summit Realty, she wouldn’t have to deal with that mess.

The room fell into an uneasy silence.

Nathaniel stubbed out his cigarette and glanced at her impatiently. "Anything else?"

Evelyn snapped out of her thoughts and shook her head. "No. I’ll get back to work."

She turned to leave.

She wouldn’t ask Nathaniel for help finding Charlotte. Charlotte wasn’t his responsibility, and Evelyn had already asked once. She wouldn’t beg.

That was her nature—ask once, and if refused, she’d never bring it up again. Even if the task seemed impossible alone, her pride wouldn’t let her plead. That was her unspoken boundary.

But before she could take a step, Nathaniel’s phone rang.

He answered tersely. "Has Grandfather calmed down?"

It was Victoria.

"You’ll find out when you get here," she chided.

Nathaniel’s tone remained indifferent. "Fine. She’s with me. I’ll bring her along."

Victoria sounded exasperated. "I only asked for you. I didn’t say anything about Evelyn."

"Evelyn is coming with me." Without waiting for a reply, he ended the call and looked at Evelyn. "Grandfather wants to see you."

Evelyn blinked. "Now?"
###Chapter 222

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her blueprints. She leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples as she tried to focus. The weight of the upcoming project pressed on her shoulders, but it wasn’t just work that clouded her thoughts.

Nathaniel had been distant lately.

Her phone buzzed, pulling her from her thoughts. A message from Gregory flashed on the screen: "Meeting in 10. The client wants changes—again."

Evelyn sighed, tossing her pencil onto the desk. Just as she stood, her assistant Gabrielle hurried in, her expression tense.

"Evelyn, you need to see this." She handed over a tablet.

The screen displayed a gossip column, featuring a photo of Nathaniel and Isabella at a high-profile charity gala the night before. The headline read: "Reunited? Martin Heir Spotted with Former Flame."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. She had known about the event—Nathaniel had mentioned it in passing—but he hadn’t said Isabella would be there.

Gabrielle hesitated. "Do you want me to cancel the meeting?"

Evelyn shook her head, forcing a calm she didn’t feel. "No. Let’s go."

As she walked down the hall, her phone vibrated again. This time, it was Nathaniel.

"We need to talk."

Three words that never meant anything good.

Evelyn clenched her jaw. Whatever was coming, she wouldn’t let it break her. Not again.

But as she stepped into the conference room, her mind raced with possibilities—none of them reassuring.

The game was far from over.

Nathaniel's voice cut through the tense silence. "What's the matter? Are you busy? Then call Grandfather yourself and explain." He stood abruptly, grabbing his car keys before casting a sharp glance at Evelyn, who remained frozen in place. "If you still care about his kindness toward you, come with me to the hospital. Now."

Evelyn hesitated only a moment before following.

She wasn’t busy. Just stunned. How did Grandfather know I was with Nathaniel?

She shook her head. Asking Nathaniel directly was out of the question.

In the parking lot, she stopped him. "I'll drive myself. I need to return to the office later. It’s more convenient."

Nathaniel halted mid-step, his piercing gaze locking onto her. "Then why agree to come with me in the first place? If I were you, I’d have refused outright. No need for this performance."

Evelyn stared at him, incredulous. "How can you think like that? Driving separately means I can go straight back to work afterward. No detours. It’s just practical."

"Don’t bother explaining. You’ve already made your decision."

Without another word, he turned and strode toward his car.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Why is he upset now?

Yet, in the end, she still drove herself to the hospital.

They arrived nearly at the same time. Nathaniel exited his car first, walking briskly ahead. Evelyn hurried after him, but he slowed deliberately at the ward door, waiting for her before entering together.

Edward’s face lit up at the sight of them. Even his usual irritation toward Nathaniel faded. "A man earns respect by cherishing his wife," he declared.

The meaning was clear.

Nathaniel, however, remained silent.

Evelyn smiled warmly. "Grandfather, you look much better. How are you feeling?"

"With you here, I feel so well I could live another decade."

"Don’t say such things," Evelyn scolded lightly, though her voice was firm. "You’ll live at least thirty more years."

Edward chuckled. "Then I’d be a walking corpse."

Evelyn laughed despite herself.

Richard and Victoria, who had been keeping Edward company, exchanged glances. Only Evelyn could draw this much cheer from him.

Nathaniel observed them coldly. She didn’t do anything special. So why does she make him so happy?

A brief silence settled before Edward turned serious. "Evelyn, your grandmother is in Mayby. Why didn’t you tell us? Do we not count as family?"

Evelyn stiffened. He knows?

She recovered quickly. "Grandfather, it wasn’t like that. She arrived unexpectedly, and she hasn’t been well. I just haven’t had the chance to mention it yet."

Victoria stepped forward, her tone gentle but earnest. "Evelyn, since your grandmother is here, we should invite her for dinner. If she’s uncomfortable at the estate, we can dine out. You and Nathaniel have been married over a year. She raised you—we should thank her properly."

The sincerity in Victoria’s voice struck Evelyn deeply.

Touched, she felt a swell of gratitude.

Beatrice and Margaret weren’t related by blood, yet Beatrice had cared for Margaret’s daughter all these years. And still, Margaret could never show Beatrice the same warmth Victoria just had.

###Chapter 223

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples as she studied the blueprints spread before her. The project deadline loomed closer, and the weight of responsibility pressed heavily on her shoulders.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Come in," she called, straightening her posture.

Gabrielle, her assistant, stepped inside with a tray of coffee and a stack of documents. "Good morning, Evelyn. I thought you might need this." She set the tray down with a warm smile.

"Thank you," Evelyn murmured, gratefully wrapping her fingers around the warm mug. The rich aroma of coffee filled the air, momentarily soothing her nerves.

Gabrielle hesitated before speaking again. "Gregory called earlier. He said the client wants to see the revised designs by this afternoon."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "That’s impossible. We haven’t even finalized the structural changes yet."

"I know," Gabrielle said sympathetically. "But he insisted. He said they’re pushing the meeting forward."

Evelyn’s grip tightened around the mug. "Of course they are." She forced a smile. "Alright, tell him I’ll have something ready by then."

As Gabrielle left, Evelyn turned back to her work, her mind racing. She had barely slept last night, tossing and turning as thoughts of Nathaniel and the growing tension between them kept her awake.

Her phone buzzed, pulling her from her thoughts. A message from Nathaniel flashed on the screen:

"We need to talk. Dinner tonight?"

Her heart skipped a beat. She hadn’t seen him in days—not since their last argument. Part of her wanted to ignore the message, to bury herself in work and avoid the inevitable confrontation. But another part, the part that still loved him despite everything, longed to see him.

She typed a quick reply: "Fine. 8 PM at the usual place."

Before she could second-guess herself, she sent it and immediately turned her attention back to the blueprints. There was no time to dwell on personal drama—not when her career was on the line.

But as she tried to focus, her mind kept drifting back to Nathaniel. To the way his eyes darkened when he was angry, the way his voice softened when he apologized.

She shook her head, forcing herself to concentrate.

One crisis at a time.

Whenever Evelyn thought about it, anger bubbled inside her. She blamed Margaret for being heartless, but she would never dare let Beatrice know. Perhaps Beatrice already suspected—she just never voiced it aloud.

Evelyn lowered her head, her lashes fluttering as she blinked back the sting in her eyes. "Thank you," she murmured softly, "but my grandmother isn't in the best health. I'm not sure if she can go out. Maybe I should ask her first and let you know? Or perhaps after her medical check-up..."

"Evelyn," Edward interrupted gently, "you don’t need to be so cautious with us. We’re family. The dinner can wait—just tell us when you and Beatrice are ready."

Evelyn nodded, warmth spreading through her chest. Edward, Richard, and Victoria treated her with such kindness—far better than the Mitchells ever had. There were no hidden agendas, no calculations—just genuine care.

Richard took over smoothly. "If Beatrice needs medical attention, let Nathaniel arrange for specialists. There’s no need to wait when we have resources. If anything comes up, you can contact Dr. Harrison directly."

"Grandfather, don’t worry," Evelyn assured him. "I’ll handle it. You just focus on resting."

She had already made the necessary calls. Since she wasn’t entirely sure about Beatrice’s condition yet, pulling strings prematurely seemed unnecessary.

Their conversation flowed effortlessly, Nathaniel completely forgotten in the background.

If he hadn’t cleared his throat pointedly, they might have left without acknowledging him.

Nathaniel’s voice was cool. "Grandfather, since you’re all enjoying yourselves so much, I assume you don’t need me anymore. Should I head back to the office?"

"Stop right there!" Edward barked, fixing him with a stern glare. "You should visit Beatrice. She’s the most important person in Evelyn’s life—which means she’s important to us too."

Evelyn stiffened, quickly interjecting, "Grandfather, that’s really not necessary. Nathaniel has work to—"

"Evelyn," Edward cut in firmly, "don’t defend him. You’ve been married for over a year. He should have met Beatrice long ago. Now that she’s in Mayby, there’s no excuse."

Edward’s tone left no room for argument. Evelyn fell silent.

Nathaniel’s gaze flickered to her, his expression unreadable. Her silence felt like rejection.

His jaw tightened, but he said nothing.

After the visit, Evelyn and Nathaniel stepped out of the hospital room. Victoria decided to return to Martin Manor with them.

Inside the elevator, Victoria studied the pair discreetly before asking in a hushed tone, "Evelyn, why were you with Nathaniel today?"

Evelyn hesitated. "We were discussing work."

"Oh?" Victoria’s eyes gleamed with curiosity. "So Nathaniel asked you to come together?"

Evelyn blinked, startled. Hadn’t Victoria been the one to suggest it?

She shot Nathaniel a questioning glance.

Without missing a beat, Nathaniel smoothly diverted the topic. "Mother, Alfora just released a limited-edition diamond bracelet. Would you like it?"



###Chapter 224

The moment Nathaniel stepped into the dimly lit study, the weight of his grandfather’s words settled heavily on his shoulders. Edward Martin sat behind the mahogany desk, his piercing gaze locked onto Nathaniel with an intensity that made the air feel thick.

"You’ve made your decision, then?" Edward’s voice was low, but the authority in it was unmistakable.

Nathaniel clenched his jaw. "Yes. I won’t let the past dictate my future."

A slow, knowing smile curled Edward’s lips. "Good. Because weakness has no place in this family."

Meanwhile, Evelyn paced the length of their penthouse, her fingers tapping restlessly against her phone. She had tried calling Nathaniel three times, but each attempt went straight to voicemail.

Where is he?

Her thoughts were interrupted by a sharp knock at the door. Gabrielle, her assistant, stood there with an urgent expression. "Evelyn, we have a problem. The client just pulled out of the Riverside project."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. "What? Why?"

Gabrielle hesitated. "They said… they heard rumors about instability in your personal life."

Evelyn’s grip on her phone tightened. Isabella.

She had no proof, but the timing was too convenient. Just as Nathaniel was being pulled back into the Martin family’s web, her career was suddenly under attack.

Back at the Martin estate, Nathaniel’s phone buzzed in his pocket—another missed call from Evelyn. He ignored it, focusing instead on the documents his grandfather slid across the desk.

"Sign these," Edward commanded. "And we’ll handle the rest."

Nathaniel hesitated, his mind flashing to Evelyn’s face. But then he remembered the ultimatum. Protect her, or lose everything.

His pen hovered over the paper.

One signature could change everything.

And he wasn’t sure if it would be for the better.

Evelyn instantly grasped Nathaniel's implication.

A playful smile curved her lips. "Of course, will you get it for me?"

Nathaniel's lips quirked. "That depends on your performance."

Evelyn shot him a look before turning to loop her arm through Victoria's, feigning complaint. "Victoria, he won't even indulge me in such a small pleasure. You're his wife—you have to back me up."

The words "you're his wife" sent an unexpected warmth flooding Evelyn's cheeks.

Softly, she defended, "He didn't mean it. Nathaniel was only teasing."

"Was he really just teasing?"

"Yes."

"Then ask him if he'll buy me the bracelet. He'll listen to you. I can't manage him anymore—he's your husband now."

Like a mischievous child, Victoria nudged Evelyn forward until she stood directly before Nathaniel.

The unspoken intention was clear—Victoria wanted them to engage. Not wishing to disappoint her, Evelyn had no choice but to comply.

She lifted her gaze to meet Nathaniel's. "You'll get the bracelet for Victoria, won't you?"

His expression remained unreadable. "What do you think?"

"I think you should."

A noncommittal hum was his only response.

Is that a yes or a no?

Evelyn hesitated, but Victoria clapped her hands in delight. "See? I knew it. Evelyn still holds more sway. Nathaniel doesn't listen to me anymore. Once a son marries, his mother takes second place to his wife."

Heat prickled Evelyn's neck as she ducked her head.

Silence settled between them.

Victoria shot Nathaniel a pointed look, urging him to speak, but he remained unmoved.

Exasperated, Victoria pressed, "How did you two get here?"

"Separate cars."

"Give me your keys, Nathaniel. I'll take yours home—I can't drive your father's. Aren't you visiting Evelyn's grandmother? Share a car." She turned to Evelyn. "That work for you?"

"Alright."

Refusal wasn't an option.

Once Victoria drove off, they slid into Evelyn's car.

The confined space amplified Nathaniel's presence, making it impossible to ignore. Evelyn focused on the road, fingers tight around the wheel.

Not a word passed between them the entire ride.

Soon, the car rolled to a stop outside the apartment complex. They took the elevator up, and Evelyn knocked on the door opposite hers.

Nathaniel had assumed she lived with Beatrice. Discovering she'd rented the adjacent unit gave him pause—though his composure never wavered.

The door swung open. Beatrice, despite her years, carried herself with grace. Her eyes lit with recognition. "Nathaniel?"

She'd memorized his face the moment she learned of Evelyn's marriage, pestering Charles for photos and details.

Nathaniel's smile was warm, his tone respectful. "Yes, it's me. I apologize for the delay in visiting, Grandma. You're not upset, are you?"

"Of course not. Come in." Beatrice beamed before instructing Evelyn, "Bring some water for Nathaniel."



###Chapter 225

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Pineview Villa, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. Evelyn stood by the window, her fingers tracing the rim of her coffee cup absently. The events of last night still lingered in her mind—Nathaniel’s unexpected confession, the way his voice had trembled when he admitted he still loved her.

Her phone buzzed on the counter. A message from Gregory.

"Evelyn, we need to talk. The Summit Realty deal is falling apart. Sebastian is demanding revisions by noon."

She sighed, rubbing her temples. Just what she needed—another crisis.

Downstairs, Alfred was setting the dining table with his usual precision. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted with a slight bow. "Mr. Martin has already left for the office. He asked me to inform you that he’ll be late tonight."

Evelyn nodded, though a flicker of disappointment crossed her features. She had hoped to talk to Nathaniel again, to clarify the emotions swirling between them.

Her phone buzzed again—this time, it was Isabella.

"We need to meet. It’s urgent."

Evelyn’s grip on her cup tightened. What could Isabella possibly want now?

At the Martin Group headquarters, Nathaniel sat in his office, staring at the financial reports Samuel had handed him. The numbers weren’t adding up. Someone was siphoning funds, and the trail led uncomfortably close to home.

A knock interrupted his thoughts. "Come in," he called.

The door opened, and Thomas stepped inside, his usual easygoing demeanor replaced by tension. "We have a problem," he said without preamble. "Dominic Lynch is making moves against Mitchell Corp. He’s been buying up shares quietly."

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched. "He’s targeting Evelyn."

Thomas nodded grimly. "And if he gains enough control, he could dismantle her father’s company piece by piece."

Nathaniel pushed back from his desk. "Call an emergency board meeting. I want every resource we have focused on stopping him."

Evelyn arrived at the café where Isabella had insisted they meet. The place was nearly empty, save for a few patrons scattered at the tables. Isabella sat by the window, her expression unreadable.

"You wanted to talk," Evelyn said, sliding into the seat opposite her.

Isabella’s fingers drummed against the table. "I know about the embezzlement," she said bluntly.

Evelyn froze. "What?"

"Someone in Nathaniel’s inner circle is stealing from Martin Group. And if the truth comes out, it’ll destroy everything." Isabella leaned forward, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Including your marriage."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. "Who is it?"

Isabella hesitated, then shook her head. "I don’t know yet. But I thought you deserved a warning."

Evelyn’s mind raced. Was this why Nathaniel had been so distant lately?

Her phone vibrated—another message from Gregory.

"Evelyn, where are you? Sebastian is here, and he’s furious."

She stood abruptly. "I have to go."

Isabella’s gaze followed her. "Be careful, Evelyn. Trust no one."

Back at her office, Evelyn found Gregory pacing in front of her desk, his face flushed with agitation. Sebastian Wilson stood by the window, his arms crossed.

"There you are," Gregory snapped. "We’re about to lose the biggest client we’ve ever had!"

Evelyn squared her shoulders. "What’s the issue?"

Sebastian turned, his cold eyes locking onto hers. "The issue, Ms. Mitchell, is that your designs don’t meet our standards. And if you can’t deliver, we’ll take our business elsewhere."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. This wasn’t just about the project—this was personal.

She took a deep breath. "Give me until the end of the day. I’ll revise the plans."

Sebastian smirked. "You have until 5 PM. No extensions."

As he strode out, Gregory exhaled sharply. "Evelyn, what the hell is going on? First Nathaniel, now this?"

She clenched her fists. "I don’t know. But I’m going to find out."

That evening, Evelyn sat at her desk, the revised blueprints spread before her. Her phone buzzed—Nathaniel.

"We need to talk. Meet me at home."

Her heart pounded. Was this about Isabella’s warning? The embezzlement? Or something worse?

She glanced at the clock. 4:45 PM.

Just enough time to finish and send the revisions.

Then she would face whatever storm was coming.

"Alright." Evelyn headed to the kitchen to fetch some water. When she returned, she found Beatrice engaged in lively conversation with Nathaniel.

Nathaniel was saying, "Grandma, would it be alright if I came by to pick you up in a few days? I've saved my contact in your phone—just give me a call anytime, and I'll be here."

"Of course, dear. Thank you." Beatrice looked even more pleased with him now.

Around Beatrice, Nathaniel was nothing but respectful and attentive, listening patiently to every word she said without a trace of impatience.

Their conversation stretched on, and they even stayed for lunch—a meal Evelyn prepared herself.

After lunch, Beatrice retired for her afternoon nap, and Evelyn walked Nathaniel downstairs.

While waiting for the elevator, Evelyn finally broke the silence. "My grandmother can be quite talkative at her age. I hope you didn’t mind. If she said anything uncomfortable, just let it go. And if she upset you in any way, I apologize on her behalf."

She met his gaze earnestly. These words came from the heart—she had assumed Nathaniel wouldn’t have the patience for Beatrice’s endless chatter.

Nathaniel scoffed. "Is that how you treated my grandfather too? Pretending to be interested while secretly wishing he’d stop talking?"

Evelyn froze.

She frowned. "Never. I was only speaking about you right now."

"Then why assume I’m that kind of person?"

"I just didn’t want you to feel burdened. It was just a thought. If you didn’t, then forget I mentioned it."

She sighed as their eyes accidentally met.

He didn’t respond, simply watching her with an unreadable expression.

Evelyn bit her lip and asked softly, "Nathaniel, what exactly did you two discuss? Did you exchange contacts? Make plans to meet somewhere?"

"Do you really want to know?"

A mocking smile played on his lips as he stared straight ahead.

Evelyn nodded. Of course she did—why else would she ask?

Nathaniel’s grin widened, and suddenly, he leaned in close, his voice dropping to a whisper. "But Grandma made me promise not to tell you."

Evelyn rolled her eyes but said nothing.

Just then, the elevator doors slid open. Nathaniel glanced at her. "No need to see me out. I’ll go alone."

With that, he stepped inside.

The doors began to close, slowly cutting off their locked gazes.

But just before they shut completely, a strong hand shot out, stopping them. His intense eyes bore into hers. "Evelyn, let’s finalize the divorce as soon as my grandfather recovers."

Her lashes fluttered, but her voice remained eerily calm. "Fine."

He smirked. "That was fast. Were you just waiting for me to say it?"



###Chapter 226

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. The warmth of Nathaniel’s arm draped over her waist was comforting, but the weight of last night’s argument still lingered in the air. She carefully slipped out of bed, not wanting to wake him.

Downstairs, Alfred had already prepared her favorite coffee—black with a hint of cinnamon. The rich aroma filled the kitchen, but even that couldn’t ease the tension coiling in her chest. She took a sip, her thoughts drifting back to Nathaniel’s words.

"You don’t trust me, do you?"

His accusation had stung. But how could she explain that it wasn’t about trust? It was about the past—about Isabella, about the secrets that still seemed to shadow them.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Gregory.

"Meeting moved to 10 AM. The investors want to see the revised blueprints."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Work was the last thing on her mind, but she couldn’t afford distractions. Not when this project could make or break her firm.

She dressed quickly, opting for a sleek navy pantsuit—professional, commanding. As she fastened her watch, the bedroom door creaked open.

Nathaniel stood there, his dark hair tousled, his expression unreadable. "You’re leaving already?"

She hesitated. "I have a meeting."

Silence stretched between them, thick and heavy. Then, he stepped closer, his voice low. "We need to talk about this, Evelyn."

Her pulse quickened. "Not now."

His jaw tightened, but he didn’t push further. Instead, he simply nodded. "Fine. But this isn’t over."

The words hung in the air as she grabbed her bag and walked out.

The conference room was packed by the time Evelyn arrived. Gregory shot her a questioning look, but she ignored it, focusing instead on the blueprints spread across the table.

"Let’s get started," she said, her tone crisp.

Halfway through the presentation, her phone buzzed again. A notification from an unknown number.

"You should ask him about the night of the gala."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. The gala—the night Nathaniel had disappeared for hours, returning with a flimsy excuse about a business call.

Her fingers trembled as she locked the screen.

Who sent this? And what did they know?

Gregory cleared his throat. "Evelyn? Everything alright?"

She forced a smile. "Yes. Let’s continue."

But her mind was elsewhere.

Because someone out there was playing games.

And she intended to find out why.

Evelyn didn’t deny it. She simply held Nathaniel’s gaze, but something heavy settled in her chest, an ache that refused to fade.

Nathaniel didn’t wait for her response. His eyes lingered on her for a moment longer before he released her hand.

This time, the elevator doors didn’t reopen.

Evelyn stood frozen, unmoving, until the indicator light signaled the first floor. Her face was pale, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears.

"This is where it ends," she whispered to herself. "I always knew this marriage wouldn’t last. Why drag it out?"

The only regret she carried was for the child growing inside her. She pressed a hand to her stomach, her voice breaking. "I’m sorry, little one."

Back in her apartment, Evelyn freshened up quickly before throwing herself into work. With the project restarting, she needed to discuss details with Gregory.

But the call didn’t connect.

She tried again—several times—until her phone refused to dial through.

Evelyn frowned. "Did he block me?"

It didn’t make sense. Gregory wouldn’t do that. Maybe his phone died, or he was somewhere with no signal. Those were the only explanations she could think of.

After setting the phone aside, she organized the project files again, then reached out to Gabrielle to finalize the details.

The afternoon slipped away in a blur of work.

By the time she finished, dusk had settled outside. Exhausted, she leaned back on the sofa, a hollow loneliness creeping in. It reminded her of the days when William and Margaret had left her at Beatrice’s house—abandoned, forgotten.

"Maybe this is just how life is," she thought bitterly. "No one stays forever."

The next morning, Evelyn arrived at Martin Group with the revised design draft in hand.

She headed straight to the project department, intending to show Daniel Carter the updates, but he shook his head. "I’m only overseeing construction now. The design approvals go straight to Mr. Martin."

Evelyn stiffened.

Nathaniel had demanded tangible results—daily updates, direct reports.

She wasn’t afraid. Just… uneasy. Being near him now felt like standing on broken glass.

But she had signed the contract. She had to follow Martin Group’s protocols.

Clutching the folder, she made her way to Nathaniel’s office—only to be stopped by Samuel Yates at the door.

"Mrs. Martin," Samuel said politely. "Mr. Martin is in a meeting."

"Should I wait?"

"You can leave the documents with me. I’ll ensure he gets them."

Evelyn’s grip tightened. "This is about the project’s progress. I’d prefer to discuss it with him directly."

Samuel didn’t argue. Evelyn waited outside the office, the minutes stretching into half an hour with no movement from inside.

Finally, she turned to Samuel. "Who is he meeting with? Is it urgent?"

"One moment, Mrs. Martin." Samuel picked up the intercom. "Mr. Martin, Mrs. Martin is here regarding the project. Should she—"

Nathaniel’s voice cut through, firm and clipped.

"Let her in."
###Chapter 227

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She studied his face—the sharp jawline, the faint stubble, the way his dark lashes rested against his cheeks. A warmth spread through her chest.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory: "Meeting at 10. Client wants revisions."

Evelyn sighed. She had hoped for a quiet morning, but work never waited. Carefully, she slipped out of bed, careful not to disturb Nathaniel.

Downstairs, Alfred had already prepared coffee. The rich aroma filled the kitchen.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted.

"Morning, Alfred," she replied, taking the cup gratefully.

As she sipped, her thoughts drifted to last night. Nathaniel had been unusually quiet after dinner, lost in thought. She had asked if something was wrong, but he’d only kissed her forehead and said, "Just tired."

She didn’t believe him.

Her phone buzzed again—Isabella’s name flashed on the screen. Evelyn’s grip tightened around her cup.

"We need to talk."

The message was simple, but the weight behind it made her pulse quicken. Isabella had been silent for weeks. Why now?

Before she could reply, footsteps sounded behind her. Nathaniel entered the kitchen, his shirt slightly rumpled from sleep.

"Morning," he murmured, pressing a kiss to her temple.

She forced a smile. "Morning."

He reached for the coffee pot, his movements slow, deliberate. "You’re up early."

"Gregory needs me at the office."

Nathaniel nodded, but his gaze lingered on her face. "Everything okay?"

Evelyn hesitated. Should she mention Isabella’s message?

Before she could decide, his phone rang. He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening. "I have to take this."

He stepped away, his voice low. Evelyn caught fragments—"not now", "later", "I’ll handle it."

Her stomach twisted.

Something was wrong. And whatever it was, Nathaniel wasn’t telling her.

As he ended the call, she met his eyes. "Who was that?"

He pocketed his phone. "Just work."

A lie.

She wanted to press further, but the tension in his shoulders stopped her. Instead, she finished her coffee in silence.

The air between them had shifted.

And Evelyn had the sinking feeling that whatever was coming—would change everything.

Nathaniel ended the call and glanced at Evelyn. "Mrs. Martin, step inside."

Evelyn gave a curt nod before making her way toward the office, design drafts in hand. She knocked once before entering.

Inside, Nathaniel lounged in his chair, a stunning woman in a figure-hugging mini dress standing beside him, gazing at him with adoration. The moment Evelyn walked in, the woman feigned hesitation. "Mr. Martin, if your wife is here... should I excuse myself?"

Though her words suggested retreat, her pout and lingering gaze betrayed her reluctance.

Nathaniel's eyes flicked to Evelyn, his expression unreadable before he smirked at the woman. "No need. My wife won’t mind." His gaze shifted back to Evelyn, challenging. "Isn’t that right, Evelyn?"

Evelyn met his dark, unyielding stare and replied coolly, "Do as you please."

"See?" Nathaniel’s voice dripped with amusement as he addressed the woman. "My wife is exceptionally understanding. Stay. Sit on the sofa—I’ll finish up here, and we’ll have lunch together."

The woman beamed, casting another triumphant glance at Evelyn before sashaying to the sofa.

Nathaniel’s demeanor shifted instantly when he turned back to Evelyn, his smile vanishing. "Speak."

The abrupt change left Evelyn momentarily frozen. She forced composure, handing him the designs.

"Daniel said I should report all progress directly to you," she began evenly. "The first section covers the initial blueprints before the project stalled. The rest is the revised draft. Most structures are still under construction—"

Nathaniel cut her off. "Is that all you came to say?"

Evelyn’s brow furrowed. "What else would there be? Are these insufficient?"

A derisive scoff escaped him. "Oh, they’re more than enough." His tone turned biting. "If that’s everything, you’re dismissed. I’ll review these later. Any revisions needed, Samuel will inform you."

"Nathaniel—"

His eyes flashed. "Evelyn, did you come here to discuss work or not?"

"Yes."

"Then adjust how you address me." His voice was ice. "Unless you want people thinking you’re here as my wife and not an architect."

Evelyn stiffened.

His mercurial moods were impossible to predict. She’d done nothing—yet somehow, she’d provoked him again.

Clenching her jaw, she replied, "Understood."

"Anything else?"

"No."

"Then get out."

He didn’t even look at her, his attention already elsewhere.

Evelyn stood there a beat longer before turning toward the door.

Just as she reached it, Nathaniel’s voice halted her. "Tell Samuel to reserve a private room at The Scarlet. I’m hosting a guest for lunch."

She froze. Realizing the order was directed at her, she turned back—just in time to see the woman bounce over to Nathaniel, looping her arm through his.

"Just the two of us, Mr. Martin?" she cooed.

"Of course." He smirked, brushing a strand of hair from her face. "Unless you’d prefer company?"

Evelyn’s stomach twisted.

She met Nathaniel’s gaze, her voice razor-sharp. "I’m not an employee of Martin Group. Relay your own messages."

Without waiting for a response, she strode out.

Behind her, the woman’s whisper carried. "Mr. Martin... did I upset Mrs. Martin?"

His laugh was low, careless. "Does it matter?"

The door clicked shut.
###Chapter 228

The moment Nathaniel stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, the air shifted. His presence commanded attention, his sharp gaze scanning the room before landing on Evelyn. She stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, the golden afternoon light casting a soft glow around her.

"Evelyn," he called, his voice low but firm.

She turned, her dark eyes meeting his. "Nathaniel."

There was a tension between them, unspoken but palpable. The last few days had been a whirlwind of emotions—arguments, misunderstandings, and fleeting moments of reconciliation.

"I need to talk to you," he said, stepping closer.

She crossed her arms. "About what?"

"About us." His jaw tightened. "About the fact that you’ve been avoiding me."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "I haven’t been avoiding you. I’ve been busy."

"Too busy to answer my calls?" His tone was edged with frustration.

She looked away, her fingers tracing the rim of her wine glass. "Maybe I just needed space."

Nathaniel closed the distance between them, his hand gently gripping her wrist. "We don’t have the luxury of space right now. Not with everything happening."

She knew what he meant. The media frenzy surrounding Isabella’s sudden return, the whispers about their marriage, the pressure from his family—it was all closing in on them.

Evelyn pulled her hand away. "Then what do you suggest we do?"

His expression darkened. "We face it together. Like we promised."

She wanted to believe him. But doubt lingered in her heart. "And what if that’s not enough?"

Nathaniel’s gaze never wavered. "Then we fight harder."

A silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken words.

Then, from the doorway, a voice interrupted. "Nathaniel, your father is looking for you."

They both turned to see Samuel Yates standing there, his expression carefully neutral.

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "Tell him I’ll be there shortly."

As Samuel retreated, Evelyn took a step back. "You should go."

Nathaniel hesitated, then reached into his pocket and pulled out a small velvet box. He opened it, revealing a delicate silver bracelet—one she had admired weeks ago but never mentioned.

"I bought this for you," he said quietly. "Before everything happened."

Evelyn’s breath caught.

He took her hand again, this time sliding the bracelet onto her wrist. "No matter what happens, remember this—you’re my choice."

Her heart pounded.

Before she could respond, he turned and walked away, leaving her standing there, the weight of his words settling deep in her chest.

Outside, the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the estate.

And Evelyn knew—the storm was far from over.

"You may leave now," Nathaniel stated icily, his gaze flickering over her before settling back into his usual detached expression. His tone brooked no argument.

The woman nervously twisted the fabric of her blouse between her fingers. "But you promised to help rebrand my image..."

"Go see Samuel. He'll handle it." Nathaniel didn't spare her another glance, reclining into the plush leather of his chair.

The internet celebrity—accustomed to adoration—left without another word. Her agent had summoned her here at dawn, whispering of opportunities in the entertainment industry. She hadn't dared ask for more.

Outside the Martin Group's towering glass doors, Evelyn sat frozen in her car, knuckles white around the steering wheel. The memory of Nathaniel's intimate exchange with that woman burned behind her eyelids.

A bitter laugh escaped her. So. Aside from Isabella, his affection is a currency spent freely—just never on me.

Back at her firm, Gabrielle intercepted her the moment she stepped through the doors. "Ms. Mitchell, Mr. Wilson called twice. He insisted you contact him immediately."

Evelyn nodded, pulling out her phone. Three attempts. Three failures.

Frowning, she snatched Gabrielle's handset.

Two rings.

"Evelyn?" Gregory's voice was frayed at the edges.

"It's me." She pressed fingers to her temple. "Why can't I reach you? Did you block my number?"

A weary sigh. "Danielle did. The doctors... they're calling it mild depression now."

"Stay with her," Evelyn said quickly. "If anything urgent comes up, Gabrielle will patch you through."

"You're not angry? She purged every female contact from my phone. I can't undo it yet—not until she stabilizes. I'll return in forty-eight hours. She has to learn to cope without me."

"Angry?" Evelyn exhaled. Danielle's inexplicable hostility toward her had always been a mystery, but mental health wasn't something to judge.

She updated Gregory about the revived project. His response was immediate: "Has Summit Realty reached out?"

"Not a word. I didn't get to ask Samuel earlier."

"Knowing Sebastian?" Gregory's tone darkened. "They won't relinquish their cut without a fight."

Evelyn shrugged. "Let them try. They were glorified middlemen. We did the actual work."

Still, Gregory's warning lingered: "Watch your back. If they cause trouble, wait for me."

The morning bled into afternoon with no progress. No news from Charlotte. Thomas's continued denials left her no leverage.

Pregnancy fatigue clung to her bones today. A few emails felt like hauling bricks. Mood swings came like summer storms—sudden and violent.

When her phone buzzed at noon, she nearly ignored it.

Until she saw the caller ID: Samuel Yates.

###Chapter 229

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She traced the curve of his jaw with her fingertips, a small smile playing on her lips.

Last night had been… unexpected.

She slipped out of bed quietly, careful not to disturb him. The events of the previous evening replayed in her mind—Isabella’s sudden reappearance, the tension in Nathaniel’s posture, the way his grip on her hand had tightened when Isabella approached them at the gala.

Evelyn exhaled sharply as she stepped into the shower, letting the warm water wash away the lingering unease. She had known about Isabella, of course. Nathaniel had been honest about his past. But seeing her in person, flawless and poised, had stirred something unsettling in Evelyn’s chest.

By the time she dressed and made her way downstairs, Alfred had already set breakfast on the table.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted with a slight bow.

"Morning, Alfred," she murmured, picking at the fruit on her plate.

Nathaniel appeared moments later, freshly showered and dressed in a tailored suit. His gaze found hers immediately, and the intensity in his eyes made her pulse quicken.

"You left without waking me," he said, his voice low.

Evelyn shrugged. "You looked like you needed the rest."

He took the seat beside her, his fingers brushing against hers. "We should talk about last night."

She stiffened. "There’s nothing to talk about."

"Isabella showing up like that—"

"—was just a coincidence," Evelyn finished for him, forcing a smile. "It’s fine, Nathaniel. Really."

His jaw tightened. "It’s not fine if it bothers you."

Before she could respond, his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening.

"I have to take this," he muttered, standing.

Evelyn watched him stride out of the room, her stomach twisting. She knew that look—something was wrong.

And she had a feeling Isabella was at the center of it.

Nathaniel’s voice was sharp as he answered the call. "What is it, Samuel?"

"Sir, there’s been an issue with the Montclair project. The investors are pulling out."

Nathaniel cursed under his breath. "Why?"

Samuel hesitated. "Rumors are circulating. About you and… Isabella Davis."

Nathaniel’s grip on the phone tightened. "What kind of rumors?"

"That you’re reigniting your past relationship. That Evelyn is just a cover."

A cold fury settled in Nathaniel’s chest. "Find out who started this. Now."

He ended the call, his mind racing. Someone was targeting him—and by extension, Evelyn.

And he had a very good idea who.

Evelyn’s phone buzzed with a message from Gregory.

"Emergency meeting at the office. We have a problem."

She frowned. Gregory wasn’t one to exaggerate.

As she grabbed her bag, Nathaniel reappeared, his expression unreadable.

"I have to go," she said.

He caught her wrist gently. "Evelyn."

She met his gaze. "What?"

"Whatever happens today, remember one thing." His voice was firm. "You’re the only one I want."

Her breath hitched. Before she could reply, he kissed her—hard, possessive, leaving no room for doubt.

When he pulled away, his eyes burned with determination.

"Trust me."

Evelyn nodded, though unease coiled in her stomach.

Something was coming.

And she wasn’t sure she was ready for it.

The moment Evelyn saw Nathaniel's name flash on her phone screen, her stomach twisted with unease.

She answered the call, and Samuel's voice, low and urgent, came through. "Mrs. Martin, Mr. Martin requests your presence at The Scarlet immediately."

Evelyn froze at the mention of The Scarlet.

That morning, Nathaniel had instructed her to have Samuel reserve a private room there for a business lunch.

So why does he want me there now—while he's dining with another woman?

"Is something wrong?" she asked, keeping her tone steady.

"Mr. Martin has some questions about the design schematics. He'd like you to clarify a few details."

"I can come to the office. It's lunchtime, and I—"

"Mrs. Martin," Samuel interrupted, his voice strained, "please come now. Mr. Martin has a packed schedule this afternoon. He won’t have time later."

Evelyn fell silent. On the other end, Samuel wiped his brow, stealing a glance at Nathaniel, who sat motionless, his expression unreadable.

Finally, Evelyn relented. "Fine."

Samuel exhaled in relief. "She’s on her way, sir."

Nathaniel said nothing.

When Evelyn arrived, Nathaniel was already seated in the private dining room.

Across from him sat Cassandra Reed—this year’s modeling competition winner. Evelyn recognized her instantly.

Pausing at the doorway, Evelyn watched as Cassandra leaned closer to Nathaniel, her lips curving into a coy smile.

"Mr. Martin," she purred, "I thought this was supposed to be a private lunch. Are we expecting company?"

Nathaniel barely glanced at Evelyn. "She’s here for work." His tone was dismissive, edged with irritation.

Evelyn arched a brow, matching his indifference. "Nathaniel, if you’d rather eat first, we can discuss the project later."

"Do I look like I have time to waste?"

His cold retort hung in the air.

Evelyn clenched her jaw but stepped inside, taking the seat directly across from him. She pulled out a duplicate set of blueprints—she’d anticipated he wouldn’t have the originals on him.

Sliding the designs toward him, she said, "Have you reviewed them? Point out what needs adjusting."

Just then, Cassandra lifted a spoonful of soup, her eyes bright with invitation. "Mr. Martin, you have to try this. It’s The Scarlet’s specialty!"

Nathaniel’s gaze flicked to Evelyn before he accepted the bowl. He took a slow sip. "Delicious."

Cassandra beamed. "And this fish—here, let me." She speared a piece with her fork, lifting it toward his mouth.

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her pen. Nathaniel had a notorious aversion to sharing utensils—even Thomas had joked about it. Yet now, he allowed Cassandra to feed him without protest.

A bitter knot twisted in Evelyn’s chest.

Before she could dwell on it, Nathaniel’s voice cut through her thoughts.

"What was your question again?"
###Chapter 230

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort that could redefine Martin Group's portfolio. Yet, despite the excitement of the design, her mind kept drifting back to Nathaniel.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in with a hesitant smile. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you. He says it's urgent."

Evelyn straightened, smoothing the creases from her blouse. "Send him in."

Gregory strode in, his usual composed demeanor replaced by visible tension. "We have a problem," he said without preamble, dropping a folder onto her desk. "Summit Realty just filed a lawsuit against us. They're claiming intellectual property theft on the coastal villa project."

Her breath hitched. "That's impossible. Our designs were finalized weeks before theirs."

Gregory ran a hand through his hair. "Sebastian Wilson is behind this. He’s been waiting for an opportunity to strike."

Evelyn's jaw tightened. Sebastian had always been a thorn in her side, but this was outright sabotage. "We need to act fast. Contact our legal team and pull all documentation proving our timeline."

Before Gregory could respond, her phone buzzed. Nathaniel's name flashed on the screen. She hesitated, then answered.

"Evelyn," his voice was uncharacteristically strained. "We need to talk. Now."

Her pulse quickened. "What’s wrong?"

"Not over the phone. Meet me at the penthouse."

The line went dead, leaving her with a sinking feeling. Something was terribly wrong.

Gregory studied her expression. "Trouble?"

She exhaled sharply. "I don’t know yet. But I need to go."

As she grabbed her coat, Gabrielle rushed in again, her face pale. "Evelyn, you need to see this." She turned her tablet screen toward her.

A headline blared across the news feed: "Martin Group Heir’s Secret Affair Exposed—Photos Surface of Nathaniel Martin with Former Flame Isabella Davis."

Evelyn's blood ran cold. The accompanying photo showed Nathaniel and Isabella in what appeared to be an intimate embrace outside a hotel.

Gregory cursed under his breath. "This is a setup."

But Evelyn barely heard him. The world around her blurred as the implications crashed down.

Nathaniel had sworn there was nothing between him and Isabella anymore. Had he lied?

Or was someone manipulating them both?

With trembling hands, she pocketed her phone and headed for the door. One way or another, she would get the truth—even if it shattered everything.

Evelyn snapped back to reality and met Nathaniel's gaze. Realizing he was waiting for her response, she asked, "Do you have any thoughts on the design draft?"

"I haven't reviewed it yet," he replied coolly. "So I can't say whether I'm satisfied or not."

"Then, are you going to look at it now or later?"

Nathaniel studied her—the delicate curve of her lips, the faint crease between her brows betraying her irritation. His voice dropped low. "Evelyn, are you impatient with me?"

"No." She lowered her eyes to the sketch in her hands, her fingers tightening slightly. Normally, the dishes spread across the table would have tempted her, but tonight, they held no appeal.

Their gazes locked, tension thickening the air. Unable to bear it any longer, Evelyn pushed back her chair. "Excuse me. I need to use the restroom."

She didn’t wait for his permission before slipping out of the private room.

The moment the door closed behind her, she exhaled sharply, her shoulders relaxing as she walked toward the ladies' room.

Then her phone buzzed in her pocket.

An unknown number flashed on the screen.

She answered, only to be met with Isabella’s shrill accusation. "Evelyn, you’re pathetic. Nathaniel is your husband, yet you let him cozy up to other women? How can you stand it?"

Evelyn’s grip on the phone tightened. "And what right do you have to question me?"

"Face it, Evelyn. Does he even treat you like a wife? If you can’t control him, you should step aside."

"So you can take my place?" Evelyn’s laugh was icy. "By all means, try. But first, you’d have to convince him to marry you."

"Don’t act so smug! You still have to watch him with other women!"

"Isabella, doesn’t it embarrass you?" Evelyn countered, her voice sharp. "He’d rather be with anyone but you. Doesn’t that tell you something?"

Silence.

Isabella had no retort.

Done with the conversation, Evelyn ended the call without another word.

Ten minutes had passed since she left the table. Hesitating briefly, she turned and headed back.

When she re-entered the room, she found it empty—the two who should have been dining were gone. Before she could react, the door slammed shut behind her.

Nathaniel stood there, his expression dark, his voice dangerously soft. "Where were you? Planning to leave without a word?"

"If I wanted to leave, I wouldn’t have come back."

His jaw clenched. "Is that how you speak to me now?"

Evelyn met his gaze evenly. "Nathaniel, I don’t know what you’re implying."

In one swift motion, he closed the distance between them, tilting her chin up with rough fingers. His eyes burned into hers, a predator cornering its prey. "You act like nothing matters. You look down on everyone—yet you’d sacrifice anything for Charlotte. Tell me, Evelyn… how far would you go for your friend Charlotte?"
###Chapter 231

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, she felt the weight of countless eyes on her. The air was thick with tension, the kind that made her fingers curl into fists at her sides. She had expected this—the whispers, the judgmental glances—but nothing could have prepared her for the sight of Isabella standing beside Nathaniel, her hand resting possessively on his arm.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Nathaniel’s expression was unreadable, his dark eyes flickering with something she couldn’t decipher. Was it guilt? Indifference? She couldn’t tell.

"Evelyn," he said, his voice low and steady.

She forced a smile, though it felt brittle. "Nathaniel. Isabella."

Isabella’s lips curved into a smirk, her fingers tightening around Nathaniel’s sleeve. "It’s been a while, hasn’t it? I was just telling Nathaniel how much I missed our little… reunions."

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms. She wouldn’t let Isabella get under her skin. Not here. Not now.

Before she could respond, Gregory appeared at her side, his presence a welcome distraction. "Evelyn, Edward wants to discuss the new project with you. He’s waiting in the study."

She nodded, grateful for the escape. "Excuse me," she murmured, stepping away before Nathaniel could say another word.

As she walked down the corridor, the muffled sound of laughter followed her. Isabella’s laughter.

Evelyn clenched her jaw.

She wouldn’t let them break her. Not again.

Nathaniel watched Evelyn disappear around the corner, his chest tightening. He hadn’t missed the way her shoulders had stiffened at Isabella’s words, the way her smile hadn’t reached her eyes.

He hated this. Hated the way Isabella kept inserting herself into his life, stirring up old wounds.

"Nathaniel," Isabella purred, leaning closer. "You’re not even listening to me."

He stepped back, putting distance between them. "Isabella, we’ve talked about this. There’s nothing left between us."

Her smile faltered, replaced by a flash of anger. "You don’t mean that."

He sighed, running a hand through his hair. "I do."

Before she could argue, Samuel approached, his expression grim. "Sir, Richard wants to see you immediately. It’s urgent."

Nathaniel nodded, relieved for the interruption. "Excuse me."

As he walked away, he couldn’t shake the image of Evelyn’s wounded expression.

He needed to fix this. Before it was too late.

Evelyn stood by the window in Edward’s study, her arms crossed tightly over her chest. The view of the gardens below was beautiful, but she barely registered it.

"Evelyn," Edward said gently, "I know this isn’t easy for you."

She turned to face him, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. "I’m fine."

He studied her for a long moment before sighing. "You don’t have to pretend with me."

Evelyn’s composure cracked. "What do you want me to say, Edward? That it doesn’t hurt seeing her with him? That I’m not—" She cut herself off, shaking her head.

Edward’s expression softened. "You still love him."

It wasn’t a question.

Evelyn didn’t answer. She didn’t need to.

The truth was written all over her face.

Nathaniel found her in the garden an hour later, standing beneath the old oak tree where they’d shared so many moments.

"Evelyn," he called softly.

She didn’t turn around. "Go back to Isabella, Nathaniel. She’s waiting for you."

He stepped closer. "I don’t want to be with her."

"Then why is she here?"

He hesitated. "It’s complicated."

Evelyn finally turned to face him, her eyes blazing. "No, it’s not. You either choose her or you choose me. But you can’t have us both."

Nathaniel reached for her, but she stepped back.

"Don’t," she whispered.

His hand fell to his side. "Evelyn, please—"

"Just go."

The finality in her voice shattered him.

But he didn’t leave.

Instead, he closed the distance between them and pulled her into his arms.

"I choose you," he murmured against her hair. "I’ve always chosen you."

Evelyn stiffened, then slowly relaxed, her hands gripping his shirt.

For the first time in weeks, she let herself hope.

Maybe, just maybe, they could find their way back to each other.

Evelyn hesitated for a brief moment before replying, confusion lacing her voice, "I told you, Charlotte is my best friend."

"So she means more to you than anyone else?" Nathaniel challenged, his tone sharp.

"I don’t understand what you’re implying."

"Don’t forget, Evelyn," he reminded coldly, "we’re still married." The words made her frown.

She pressed further. "Nathaniel, are you saying I haven’t been a proper wife to you?"

Silence.

His lack of response was answer enough.

A bitter smile curved her lips. "Even if I tried to stop you from seeing other women, would you listen? No. So why should I bother doing something that only irritates you?"

"So you’d rather turn a blind eye?" His voice dropped dangerously. "If I slept with someone else, you’d just accept it? What if I asked you to personally hand me condoms—would you do that too?"

Each word was a needle, pricking at her heart.

Evelyn said nothing. Nathaniel tightened his grip on her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. "Answer me. Is this really how you feel?"

"If that’s what you believe, then yes."

Her chin ached under his crushing hold, but she refused to look away.

Nathaniel’s lips curled into a humorless smirk. "So it’s up to me, is it? Then maybe you shouldn’t see Charlotte anymore. How does that sound?"

"Nathaniel, this is about us," she snapped, her voice rising. "Why bring Charlotte into it?"

"Why?" He scoffed. "Because I hate your attitude. If you want Charlotte released sooner, you’d better start behaving."

With that, he released her, but the cold fury in his eyes remained. Without another word, he turned and walked out.

Evelyn stood frozen, the weight of his threat settling over her. After a long moment, she mechanically gathered her design sketches and left the room.

He was blackmailing her. She knew it. The problem was, she had no idea what would satisfy him.

Outside the Scarlett, she slid into her car, the suffocating weight of exhaustion pressing down on her.

How many times had they parted like this? She’d lost count. Every argument left her drained—physically, emotionally.

She almost wished Nathaniel would just say it outright: "Evelyn, I won’t help you find Charlotte, and I definitely won’t speak to Thomas on your behalf. Give up."

At least then, she wouldn’t keep hoping.

But now, she was trapped in this cycle—always wondering if the next concession would finally make him relent.

Evelyn let out a hollow laugh, shaking her head. Then, she started the car and drove back to her office.

Sebastian Wilson from Summit Realty arrived just as she did, his expression stormy.

"Evelyn," he seethed, "care to explain why you still have that project while we’ve been cut out?"

"I didn’t make that decision," she replied flatly. "Nathaniel did."
###Chapter 232

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort that could redefine Summit Realty's portfolio.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Evelyn, do you have a minute?" Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in with a hesitant smile.

"Of course," Evelyn replied, pushing a loose strand of hair behind her ear.

Gabrielle stepped inside, clutching a tablet. "Mr. Wilson just called. He wants to discuss the resort proposal before the board meeting tomorrow."

Evelyn's stomach tightened. Sebastian Wilson wasn't just her client—he was a man who thrived on power plays. "Did he say what he wanted to change?"

Gabrielle shook her head. "Only that it's urgent."

Sighing, Evelyn glanced at the clock. "Tell him I'll be there in an hour."

As Gabrielle left, Evelyn's phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel lit up the screen:

Dinner tonight? I have something to tell you.

Her pulse quickened. Nathaniel had been distant lately, buried in Martin Group affairs. A dinner invitation was unusual—and cryptic.

She typed a quick reply: Of course. Where?

His response came instantly: Pineview. 8 PM.

Pineview Villa—their private sanctuary. Whatever he wanted to discuss, it was important.

Evelyn turned back to her blueprints, but her mind wandered. Was it about Isabella? The woman had been lurking at the edges of their lives ever since Nathaniel's grandfather's will had been read. Or was it something else entirely?

A knock sounded again—this time sharper. Gregory Wilson, her business partner, leaned against the doorframe, his expression grim. "We have a problem."

Evelyn straightened. "What now?"

"Jonathan Blake just pulled Summit Realty's funding. The resort project is on hold."

Her breath hitched. "What? Why?"

Gregory's jaw tightened. "Because Sebastian Wilson wants you personally overseeing his new venture—exclusively."

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists. This wasn't business. This was a power move.

And Nathaniel's mysterious dinner suddenly felt like a storm on the horizon.

"You're Nathaniel's wife, yet you can't make a simple decision?" Sebastian sneered as he strode into her office, dropping onto the couch without invitation. His voice dripped with disdain. "Evelyn, did you just use us as a stepping stone? Now that you've found a better opportunity, you're tossing us aside, is that it?"

"Mr. Wilson, let me correct you." Evelyn met his glare evenly. "As you pointed out, I am Nathaniel's wife. Why would I need to use Summit Realty as a stepping stone? I married him long before I ever met you. So, where is this accusation coming from?"

Sebastian's relentless questioning grated on her nerves, but she refused to back down. If she stayed silent, he’d take it as an admission of guilt.

She crossed her arms. "I fought for you. But tell me—what exactly have you sacrificed for this project? The design? That was all me. The logistics? Handled entirely by Martin Group. And as far as I know, Summit Realty has received every cent of compensation owed. So tell me, what more do you want from me?"

Sebastian's eyes darkened. "So this is it? You're cutting ties?"

"I'm saying I don’t control this project. I hold no real power at Martin Group. Stop making me the villain here."

A cold smirk twisted his lips. "We'll see about that, Evelyn."

She said nothing as he stormed out, slamming the door hard enough to rattle the glass.

Frustration coiled in her chest, but what else could she do?

Sebastian left her office building and drove straight to The Velvet Lounge, an exclusive underground bar hidden beneath Mayby’s glittering skyline. The kind of place where the city’s elite whispered secrets over expensive whiskey.

He bypassed the main area and headed for the most secluded VIP room. Inside, a man lounged on the plush sofa, swirling a glass of amber liquor.

Sebastian smirked as he approached. "Donovan. I need a favor."

Donovan Sinclair arched a brow. "Let me guess—Martin Group screwed you over?"

"Evelyn did. With Nathaniel backing her, she shut us out. I can’t touch them directly."

Donovan chuckled, low and dangerous. "Fortunes change, Sebastian. Pick the right allies, and you’ll never lose."

The unspoken promise in his words eased the tension in Sebastian’s shoulders.

Excusing himself, Sebastian stepped out and dialed a number. A sly grin spread across his face as the line connected.

"Feel like teaching Evelyn a lesson?"

The voice on the other end responded, and Sebastian’s grin widened. "Perfect. I’ll come get you now."

Mayby’s weather was fickle this time of year—sunny one moment, storming the next.

At Pineview Villa, Evelyn stirred a pot of soup, the rich aroma filling the kitchen. Alfred had called earlier, summoning her here urgently.

Outside, rain lashed against the windows, relentless.

Then—footsteps.

Nathaniel descended the stairs, his expression grim.

"Evelyn," he said, voice tight. "Come with me."
###Chapter 233

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, her breath caught in her throat. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the marble floors, and the scent of fresh roses filled the air. But it wasn’t the opulence that unsettled her—it was the weight of Nathaniel’s gaze, dark and unreadable, as he stood near the fireplace, a glass of whiskey in hand.

She hadn’t expected him to be here.

"Evelyn," he said, his voice low, sending a shiver down her spine. "You’re late."

She forced a smile, gripping the strap of her bag tighter. "Traffic was terrible."

A lie. She had spent the last hour pacing in her car, debating whether to come at all.

Isabella’s sudden reappearance had thrown everything into chaos. The woman who had once held Nathaniel’s heart—the one Evelyn had foolishly believed was gone for good—was now standing in the corner of the room, her crimson dress like a warning sign.

"Ah, Evelyn," Isabella purred, gliding forward. "How lovely to see you again."

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. "Isabella. I didn’t realize you were back in town."

"Just for a little while." Her smile was razor-sharp. "Nathaniel insisted."

The words were a deliberate jab, and Evelyn felt the sting. She glanced at Nathaniel, but his expression gave nothing away.

Gregory, ever the peacemaker, stepped in. "Evelyn, I was just telling Edward about the new project. He’s quite interested."

She seized the lifeline. "Yes, the waterfront development. It’s going to be revolutionary."

Edward Martin, Nathaniel’s grandfather, gave her an approving nod. "Your designs are always impressive, my dear."

But before she could respond, Nathaniel cut in. "We should discuss the details later. In private."

His tone left no room for argument.

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. What was he planning?

Just then, Vanessa, Isabella’s ever-loyal shadow, appeared with a tray of champagne. "Drinks, anyone?"

Isabella plucked a glass with a smirk. "Oh, don’t mind if I do."

Evelyn declined with a shake of her head. She needed a clear mind tonight.

As the evening wore on, the tension thickened. Every glance Nathaniel sent her way felt like a silent challenge. Every word Isabella spoke dripped with hidden meaning.

And then, just as Evelyn was about to excuse herself, Nathaniel’s hand closed around her wrist.

"We need to talk," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear. "Now."

Her heart hammered. Whatever he had to say, she wasn’t sure she was ready to hear it.

But one thing was certain—the game had just changed.

The moment Evelyn heard Nathaniel's voice, she spun around. His striking features were shadowed with unease, his usual composure shattered. The panic in his eyes sent a ripple of alarm through her.

"Where are we going? What's wrong?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Nathaniel's gaze flickered over her face. "Just come with me, please?"

Outside, the storm raged on, rain pelting against the windows like a relentless drumbeat. Without another word, Evelyn followed him. The moment they stepped outside, cold droplets soaked through her clothes. She barely had time to fasten her seatbelt before Nathaniel slammed his foot on the accelerator, the car lurching forward with a sharp growl of the engine.

The speedometer climbed dangerously high.

Evelyn gripped the door handle, her knuckles whitening. "Nathaniel, slow down! You can't drive like this in a storm!"

His jaw tightened, his fingers clenched around the steering wheel. He didn't respond.

Her stomach twisted. Something was terribly wrong.

Thirty minutes later, the car screeched to a halt in front of an opulent estate. A servant stood at the entrance, umbrella in hand, waiting. Nathaniel grabbed Evelyn's wrist and pulled her inside before she could protest.

The grand foyer was immaculate, all marble and crystal. But Evelyn's attention snapped to the figure on the sofa—Thomas. His usually polished appearance was disheveled, his shirt half-buttoned, his hair dripping wet.

The moment he saw them, he surged to his feet. "Has Charlotte contacted you?" His voice was rough, desperate. "Is she hiding? Did she run again?"

Understanding crashed over Evelyn. That was why Nathaniel had dragged her here in the middle of the storm.

Her pulse spiked. "Charlotte's missing?"

Thomas's eyes narrowed, searching her face for deception. The intensity of his stare made Nathaniel step forward, his voice sharp. "She disappeared under your watch. Why are you interrogating Evelyn?"

Thomas turned away, his gaze fixed on the storm outside. Lightning split the sky, illuminating his hollow expression. "She vanished when the rain started. Climbed down from the balcony. No one noticed in the chaos." His voice was hollow. "I only realized when I got back."

"You locked her in?" Evelyn's voice rose, fury igniting in her chest. "I told you not to hurt her! What the hell were you thinking?"

Thomas didn't answer.

Evelyn scoffed. "So why drag me here? Do you think I helped her escape?"

"That's not—"

"Save it." She cut him off, her hands shaking. The storm outside mirrored the tempest inside her. Charlotte had no phone, no money—nowhere to go in Mayby except to her.

Thomas exhaled sharply. "The police are reviewing surveillance footage. But the storm's delaying everything."

Silence fell. A servant offered water, but Evelyn ignored it.

Nathaniel reached for her hand, but she jerked away before he could touch her. The look she gave him was icy. Without a word, she stalked to the sofa and sat stiffly.

Nathaniel's brow furrowed, but he said nothing.

They waited in suffocating silence, the only sound the relentless downpour outside.



###Chapter 234

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, the air shifted. The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the marble floors, but the warmth didn’t reach her. Nathaniel stood by the fireplace, his expression unreadable, his broad shoulders tense beneath his tailored suit.

"You're late," he said, his voice low but sharp.

Evelyn resisted the urge to roll her eyes. "Traffic," she replied smoothly, though they both knew that wasn’t the real reason.

Isabella’s sudden reappearance had thrown everything into chaos. The woman who had once held Nathaniel’s heart—and nearly destroyed it—was back, and the tension between them was palpable.

Edward Martin, Nathaniel’s grandfather, cleared his throat from his armchair. "We have matters to discuss," he said, his piercing gaze shifting between them. "The board is questioning Nathaniel’s leadership after the recent scandal."

Evelyn clenched her fists. The scandal—rumors of Nathaniel’s past with Isabella resurfacing, threatening to undermine everything they’d built.

"I’ll handle it," Nathaniel said firmly.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Will you?" She couldn’t keep the edge from her voice. "Because last time, you nearly lost everything."

His jaw tightened. "I won’t make the same mistake twice."

A knock interrupted them. Samuel Yates, Nathaniel’s secretary, stepped in. "Sir, the press has caught wind of Isabella’s return. They’re already speculating."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Perfect."

Nathaniel turned to her, his dark eyes burning with intensity. "Trust me."

She wanted to. But trust had been broken before.

As the meeting continued, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A message from Gregory Wilson, her business partner: "We have a problem. The Summit Realty deal is falling apart. Sebastian Wilson is pulling out."

Her stomach dropped. That deal was crucial for her firm.

She excused herself, stepping into the hallway. The moment the door closed behind her, she dialed Gregory. "What happened?"

"Sebastian claims we breached contract terms," Gregory said, frustration lacing his words. "But we didn’t. He’s looking for an excuse."

Evelyn’s mind raced. Sebastian Wilson wasn’t just a client—he was a predator in a tailored suit, and he’d been circling her for months.

"I’ll handle it," she said, echoing Nathaniel’s words.

But as she ended the call, she couldn’t shake the feeling that everything was unraveling.

Back inside the room, Nathaniel’s gaze locked onto hers. "Problem?"

She forced a smile. "Nothing I can’t handle."

But the truth was, the walls were closing in. And this time, she wasn’t sure if they’d survive the fallout.

Thomas needed a cigarette desperately. He pushed himself up from the couch and strode toward the balcony, Nathaniel shadowing his every step. "What the hell happened?" Nathaniel demanded in a low, dangerous tone. "How could she vanish from the balcony at a time like this?"

"Don't ask me," Thomas snapped, running a hand through his disheveled hair. His usual composed demeanor had shattered completely.

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "Did you lay a hand on her?"

"Of course not—"

"You'd better not have," Nathaniel cut him off, casting a glance at Evelyn who sat rigidly on the sofa, her face pale. "Because of you, she's blaming me now too."

Thomas exhaled sharply but remained silent, the weight of guilt pressing down on him. Two agonizing hours crawled by. The clock struck eleven.

A servant brought up a tray of food—Thomas hadn't eaten dinner. "Mr. Ellsworth, you should eat something."

Thomas didn't even look at it.

"Eat," Nathaniel ordered. "Starving yourself won't help."

Just as Thomas reached for the spoon, Evelyn's icy voice sliced through the tension. "If I were him, I wouldn't have an appetite. If anything happens to Charlotte, this meal would taste like ashes."

"Evelyn," Nathaniel warned.

"Going to defend him now? Worried I'm hurting his precious feelings?"

"That's not what I meant. He needs his strength to face whatever comes next when we find her."

Nathaniel's words made Thomas wish he'd never spoken at all.

Evelyn fell silent again, the quiet stretching until midnight. Exhaustion etched deep lines into their faces.

Then—Thomas's phone rang.

He answered immediately, putting it on speaker. "Mr. Ellsworth, we've reviewed the surveillance with the police. Ms. Bennett took a taxi after leaving the villa—"

"Where did she go?" Thomas interrupted, his voice raw.

The man on the line hesitated. "We... haven't located her yet. But we identified the taxi driver. He's a known predator."

Evelyn shot to her feet, snatching the phone. "What are you saying?" Her voice trembled.

A beat of silence. Then, grimly: "The police have records on him. Recently released. Multiple offenses—all involving young, vulnerable women..."

"What does that have to do with Charlotte? If you found him, where is she?" Evelyn's control shattered, her breaths coming too fast.

Thomas understood instantly. "Find him. Now. I want that bastard in front of me within the hour."

Nathaniel was already dialing Samuel. "Get your contacts on this. They'll cover ground faster than the police."

As Nathaniel barked orders, Thomas ended the call. Evelyn turned on him, her eyes blazing. "Thomas. Tell me—do you regret it yet?"

###Chapter 235

The morning sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Pineview Villa, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. Evelyn stretched lazily in bed, her fingers brushing against the cold sheets where Nathaniel should have been. The digital clock on the nightstand blinked 7:32 AM in bold red numbers.

Downstairs, the scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with Rosalind's famous blueberry pancakes. Evelyn padded barefoot into the kitchen, where Alfred was setting the breakfast table with military precision. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," the butler greeted with a slight bow. "Mr. Martin left early for an urgent board meeting."

Evelyn sighed, stirring honey into her chamomile tea. These sudden disappearances had become more frequent since Nathaniel took over as CEO. Just as she took her first sip, her phone vibrated violently against the quartz countertop.

"Evelyn! You need to see this!" Gregory's voice crackled through the speaker before she could even say hello. "Check your email. Now."

Her fingers trembled as she opened the attachment - architectural plans for the new Martin Group headquarters, bearing her signature but with critical structural elements altered. The changes were subtle but deadly, enough to cause catastrophic failure during seismic activity. And the submission date showed yesterday - when she'd been at her grandmother Beatrice's birthday party all afternoon.

The front door burst open. Nathaniel stood framed in the doorway, his usually immaculate tie loosened, eyes wild. "Evelyn, we need to talk about the-"

"Blueprints?" She held up her phone, the damning documents glowing on screen. "Care to explain how my designs got butchered and submitted under my name?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "That's what I came to discuss. The board received an anonymous tip about safety violations. Edward's demanding an emergency audit."

A chill ran down Evelyn's spine. Someone was setting her up. And with Isabella Davis back in town after her Paris fashion show, the timing couldn't be more suspicious.

The grandfather clock in the foyer chimed eight times as Evelyn grabbed her car keys. "Tell Dr. Harrison to prep the private jet," she ordered Alfred. "We're going to Zurich."

Nathaniel blocked her path. "The Swiss branch? Why?"

"Because," Evelyn said, slipping past him, "that's where the original unaltered files are stored. And whoever did this clearly doesn't know about my backup protocol."

As she revved the engine of her Aston Martin, Evelyn caught a glimpse of a familiar silver Mercedes parked discreetly down the street. The tinted windows revealed nothing, but she'd recognize that custom license plate anywhere - VANESSA1. Isabella's agent.

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh, not giving Thomas a chance to respond before continuing, "Regret? Don't make me laugh. How could you possibly regret anything? Is this your twisted way of getting back at her for leaving you? But here's the truth—she did nothing wrong. You did. You're the one who couldn't let go, even though you had a fiancée. If you couldn't give Charlotte a future, why drag her into your mess? Was your fragile male ego worth destroying her? Do you honestly think she'll ever forgive you?"

The moment the words left her lips, Thomas's expression darkened further.

"Evelyn," he said through gritted teeth, "you’ve always had a way with words. Are you done mocking me? If so, maybe you could let me focus on finding her before it's too late."

"Oh, so now you're angry because I spoke the truth?" Evelyn shot back, her frustration boiling over. "What’s more important—finding Charlotte or defending your pride?"

"Do you think I want to argue with you?" she continued, her voice sharp. "Thomas, I warned you not to hurt her. You promised. If you couldn’t keep that promise, why keep her trapped in your world? What did she ever do to deserve this? Love isn’t a game, but you’re treating it like one!"

"Evelyn," Thomas said coldly, "are these her words too?"

"Does it matter?" she snapped. "In your mind, she’s already the villain. Why bother asking me if you won’t believe the answer?"

Her anger was barely contained. If they weren’t in Mayby, she would’ve made him pay right then and there.

The tension between them was suffocating.

Nathaniel strode into the room, his presence immediately shifting the energy.

Thomas glared at him. "Control your wife. I’m not in the mood for this."

Nathaniel arched a brow, unimpressed. "Samuel’s already tracking the cab driver’s connections. We’ll have leads soon."

Thomas gave a stiff nod.

Then Nathaniel added dryly, "Your woman is missing, and you’re snapping at me? Maybe if you’d taken better care of her, we wouldn’t be in this mess."

Thomas clenched his fists but said nothing—Nathaniel wasn’t someone he could lash out at.

Nathaniel moved to Evelyn’s side, taking her hand. "He’s using every resource he has to find Charlotte. Just breathe, love."

Evelyn turned away, too furious to respond.

Before she could speak, Nathaniel’s phone rang.

The storm outside raged on, the downpour making communication difficult.

Nathaniel answered, and Samuel’s voice crackled through, barely audible over the rain. "Mr. Martin, the police intel was correct. The driver Charlotte got into the cab with has a history of violent behavior. His coworkers say he’s been reported multiple times for harassing female passengers. You—and Mr. Ellsworth—need to brace yourselves."

A heavy silence fell over the room.

Those few seconds stretched into an eternity.

Then Thomas snatched the phone, his voice raw with fury. "What the hell do you mean, 'brace yourselves'?! Find her. Now. If anything happens to her—"

His voice broke, his entire body trembling with rage and terror.

Nathaniel took the phone back, his tone firm. "Samuel, prioritize finding her. Keep me updated."

"Yes, sir."

The call ended, leaving the room in suffocating silence.

Evelyn whirled on Thomas, her eyes blazing. "If she’s hurt because of you, I swear, the Bennetts and I will make sure you regret it for the rest of your miserable life."

Her threat hung in the air, thickening the tension until it was nearly unbearable.

###Chapter 236

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden streaks across her blueprints. She exhaled sharply, rubbing her temples. The final design for the Martin Group’s luxury resort was due today, and she had spent the entire night perfecting every detail.

Her phone buzzed—Nathaniel.

"Meeting in thirty. Don’t be late."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. As if she needed the reminder. She had been working on this project for months, pouring her heart into every sketch, every calculation. This wasn’t just another contract—it was her chance to prove herself, not just as Nathaniel’s wife, but as an architect in her own right.

She grabbed her portfolio and strode out of her office, nearly colliding with Gabrielle, her assistant.

"Whoa! Someone’s in a hurry," Gabrielle teased, steadying her coffee cup before it could spill.

"Thirty minutes," Evelyn muttered, adjusting the strap of her bag. "And I still need to print the final revisions."

Gabrielle waved a folder. "Already done. And I double-checked the measurements. Everything’s perfect."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "You’re a lifesaver."

The elevator ride to the executive floor was agonizingly slow. Evelyn tapped her foot, mentally rehearsing her presentation. She knew the board would scrutinize every decision, every choice she had made. And with Isabella Davis lurking in the shadows, waiting for her to fail, she couldn’t afford a single misstep.

The doors slid open, revealing Nathaniel leaning against the wall, arms crossed. His sharp gaze flickered over her, lingering on the dark circles under her eyes.

"You look exhausted."

Evelyn straightened her blazer. "I’m fine."

He frowned but said nothing, pushing off the wall to walk beside her. "Just remember—this is your moment. Own it."

She swallowed hard. His words should have been comforting, but they only added to the weight pressing against her chest.

The conference room was already packed when they entered. Edward Martin sat at the head of the table, his expression unreadable. Richard and Victoria occupied the seats beside him, their polite smiles not quite reaching their eyes. And then there was Isabella, perched elegantly near the window, her lips curved into a smirk.

Evelyn clenched her jaw.

Showtime.

She set her portfolio on the table and began her presentation, her voice steady despite the storm of nerves inside her. The blueprints unfurled, revealing a breathtaking fusion of modern luxury and sustainable design.

Halfway through, Isabella interrupted.

"Interesting concept," she drawled, tilting her head. "But isn’t this a bit… ambitious for someone with so little experience?"

The room went still.

Evelyn met her gaze, unflinching. "Ambition is what drives innovation, Isabella. Or would you prefer mediocrity?"

A flicker of irritation crossed Isabella’s face, but before she could retort, Edward cleared his throat.

"Enough." His sharp tone silenced the room. "Evelyn, proceed."

She did, detailing every aspect with precision, her confidence growing with each passing minute. By the time she finished, even Richard looked impressed.

Edward studied her for a long moment before nodding. "Approved."

The tension in Evelyn’s shoulders eased—until she caught Nathaniel’s expression. His eyes were dark, his jaw tight. Something was wrong.

As the meeting adjourned, he pulled her aside.

"We need to talk."

Her stomach dropped.

Now what?

Nathaniel sensed the tension thickening the air and reached out to comfort Evelyn. "She'll be fine. I've already sent people to search for her. Just try to stay calm."

"Calm?" Evelyn's voice cracked with disbelief as she shot up from the couch. "How can you expect me to stay calm? Charlotte isn't your friend. She means nothing to you, so of course you don’t care!"

She couldn’t stand being in the same room with Nathaniel and Thomas any longer. Every second spent near them made her blood boil.

Before she could storm out, Nathaniel caught her wrist, his grip firm. "Where do you think you're going? It's pouring outside. Don’t make this worse."

Evelyn’s hollow, furious gaze locked onto his. "Nathaniel, do you even realize the danger Charlotte is in? All of this is because of your friend Thomas. And yet, you’re still protecting him?"

It was rare for Evelyn to lose control like this in front of him. Normally, she swallowed her anger, masking it behind forced composure. But not tonight. Tonight, the dam had broken.

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened as he lowered his voice. "I’m not protecting him. I’m telling you to think rationally. My men are already looking for her. What good will running out into the storm do? Do you think you’ll fare better than Charlotte?"

Evelyn fell silent, her chest heaving.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "No one wanted this to happen."

"Didn’t they?" Her bitter laugh was laced with accusation. "I begged for your help, Nathaniel. Over and over. But you refused. You’re just as guilty as Thomas. So tell me—what right do you have to ask me to calm down? Neither Charlotte nor I matter to you. Our safety means nothing."

"Is this really the time for this argument?" Nathaniel’s voice was dangerously quiet.

Evelyn yanked her arm free. "No. So let me go."

When he didn’t, she twisted away with enough force to stumble back. She couldn’t stay here—not another second. The walls were closing in, suffocating her.

But Nathaniel grabbed her again, fingers digging into her skin. That was the final straw.

Her palm cracked across his cheek before she could stop herself.

The sharp sound echoed in the room. Evelyn’s breath hitched as she stared at Nathaniel, his face turned slightly from the impact. The fire inside her hadn’t dimmed.

"Stay away from me."



###Chapter 237

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She traced the curve of his jaw with her fingertips, marveling at how peaceful he looked.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory flashed on the screen: "Emergency meeting at the office. Need you here ASAP."

Evelyn sighed. She had hoped for a quiet morning with Nathaniel, but duty called. Slipping out of bed, she dressed quickly in a tailored navy suit, her mind already racing through possible crises at the firm.

Downstairs, Alfred had prepared her usual espresso. "Good morning, Miss Evelyn. Will Mr. Nathaniel be joining you for breakfast?"

"Not today," she replied, taking the cup. "I have to head out early."

The drive to the office was tense. The city streets buzzed with activity, but Evelyn barely noticed. Her thoughts were consumed by Gregory's urgent summons.

When she arrived, the conference room was already packed. Gregory stood at the head of the table, his expression grim. "We have a problem," he announced. "Summit Realty just pulled out of the Riverside project."

A murmur of disbelief rippled through the room. Evelyn's stomach tightened. That project was their biggest contract this year.

"What happened?" she demanded.

Gregory rubbed his temples. "Sebastian Wilson claims we missed a deadline. But I checked—we submitted everything on time."

Evelyn's jaw clenched. Sebastian had been a thorn in their side for months. "This is sabotage," she muttered.

Gabrielle, her assistant, handed her a folder. "I pulled the correspondence. There's no record of any missed deadlines."

Evelyn scanned the documents, her anger simmering. "We need to fight this. Gabrielle, schedule a meeting with Sebastian. Today."

As the team dispersed, Gregory pulled her aside. "Be careful, Evelyn. Sebastian isn't playing fair."

She met his gaze squarely. "Neither am I."

Back in her office, Evelyn dialed Nathaniel. He answered on the second ring, his voice warm. "Miss me already?"

She smiled despite herself. "Always. But I need your help."

When she explained the situation, Nathaniel's tone turned serious. "I'll call Jonathan Blake. He owes me a favor."

Relief washed over her. "Thank you."

"Anything for you," he murmured.

As she hung up, Evelyn felt a renewed determination. Sebastian Wilson had picked the wrong fight.

The day passed in a blur of phone calls and strategy sessions. By evening, Evelyn was exhausted but hopeful. Nathaniel's intervention had opened a backchannel with Summit Realty.

She arrived home to find him waiting in the foyer. Without a word, he pulled her into his arms. "Long day?"

She rested her head against his chest. "The longest."

He kissed her forehead. "Come on. Dinner's ready."

In the dining room, candlelight flickered across the table. Rosalind had outdone herself—Evelyn's favorite dishes were laid out in an elegant spread.

Nathaniel poured her a glass of wine. "To us," he said, clinking his glass against hers.

Evelyn smiled. "To us."

As they ate, the tension of the day melted away. Here, with Nathaniel, she could let her guard down.

Later, as they curled up on the couch, her phone buzzed again. It was Gabrielle: "Sebastian agreed to a meeting tomorrow. 10 AM."

Evelyn showed the message to Nathaniel.

He smirked. "Looks like we have him on the ropes."

She snuggled closer. "We'll see."

Outside, the city lights twinkled like stars. Whatever tomorrow brought, Evelyn knew one thing for certain: she wasn't facing it alone.

Thomas sat rigidly on the sofa, his expression growing increasingly grim as he took in the scene before him.

Nathaniel, in stark contrast, remained utterly unfazed. His grip didn't loosen, his tone measured and cold. "That wasn't my intention. No one wishes harm upon her. But what's done is done—our priority now is damage control. You can hate me all you want, but ask yourself this: do you really want me diverting my attention from finding Charlotte to dealing with you?"

Evelyn said nothing. Her palm stung from the force of her slap, the heat lingering like a brand. She lowered her gaze, her mind a tempest of helpless fury.

Nathaniel pressed on, relentless. "Evelyn, is this really the time to pick a fight with me? What matters now is bringing Charlotte home safely. Once this is over, you can take your anger out on me however you please. But not now."

Evelyn fell silent, though the ice in her glare remained.

She didn’t join them. Instead, she retreated to the window seat, curling into the plush cushions of the chaise lounge. The hour was late, but sleep was the furthest thing from her mind.

Her thoughts spiraled, a desperate plea echoing in her chest. Charlotte, where are you?

When did our story begin?

Perhaps it was the way they had recognized kindred spirits in each other—two souls who had known loneliness too well.

Evelyn had been "banished" to Beatrice’s side by William and Margaret, too cowed to resist. Then Charlotte had walked into her life, bright and unshakable, like sunlight breaking through storm clouds. Their friendship had been unbreakable ever since.

Just as Charlotte had once joked, "Evelyn, we share everything—except men."

How could she not be frantic now?

She wished Charlotte had never come to visit. Then none of this would have happened.

But wishing was useless. All she could do was wait, and the helplessness was eating her alive.

Exhaustion weighed on her, but her mind refused to quiet. For the sake of the baby, she forced herself to stay still, to breathe. She needed rest, but her thoughts were razor-sharp, slicing through any hope of sleep.

The night stretched on, endless.

Dawn was creeping in when she finally slumped against the cushions, her eyes fluttering shut. Nathaniel draped a blanket over her before retreating to the dining room.

Neither he nor Thomas had slept. Thomas’s eyes were bloodshot from the long vigil. Nathaniel studied him before speaking. "It's been hours. You know what that means. So—what’s your move?"

Thomas didn’t answer immediately. His head bowed, his silence heavy.

A breakfast spread lay untouched on the table. He had no appetite.

Finally, he spoke, voice rough. "Nathaniel… do you believe in karma?"

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed. "Are you in love with her?"

"Does it matter?"

"What do you think?"

Thomas exhaled sharply. "This time… I went too far. Whatever happens, I won’t walk away."

The decision had come after hours of torment, the gnawing dread making him intimately acquainted with regret.

Nathaniel’s gaze sharpened. "Do you understand the weight of what you’re saying?"

"Tell me, Nathaniel—do you think this is just another fleeting obsession to me?"

"My opinion doesn’t matter. This is your choice. But ask yourself—do you really think Penelope’s family will stand for it?"

Thomas had no answer.



###Chapter 238

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Nathaniel's penthouse, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Evelyn stood by the window, her fingers tracing the delicate rim of her coffee cup, lost in thought. The events of the past few days weighed heavily on her mind—Isabella's sudden reappearance, the tension between her and Nathaniel, and the whispers circulating through Martin Group's corridors.

She exhaled sharply, setting the cup down with a soft clink. The silence in the penthouse was almost suffocating. Normally, Nathaniel would have been up by now, dressed impeccably in one of his tailored suits, ready to tackle the day with that infuriatingly confident smirk of his. But today, the master bedroom door remained firmly shut.

A soft knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, smoothing the fabric of her silk robe.

The door opened, revealing Alfred, their ever-composed butler. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin. Mr. Yates is here to see you."

Evelyn frowned. Samuel never visited this early unless it was urgent. "Send him in."

Samuel stepped inside, his usual polished demeanor slightly frayed at the edges. His tie was loosened, and there was a faint crease between his brows. "Evelyn," he greeted, his voice tight. "We have a problem."

Her stomach twisted. "What happened?"

"It's about the Summit Realty deal." He hesitated, then pulled out a tablet, swiping to a news article. The headline blared in bold letters: "Martin Group's Secret Dealings Exposed—Scandal Involving Summit Realty and Hidden Funds."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "This can't be right. Nathaniel would never—"

"That's not all," Samuel interrupted grimly. "There are allegations of insider trading, and the board is calling for an emergency meeting. Sebastian Wilson is already preparing a statement to distance Summit Realty from the fallout."

Her fingers curled into fists. "Where's Nathaniel?"

Samuel's gaze flickered toward the closed bedroom door. "He's been on the phone all night. He told me not to disturb you, but—"

Evelyn didn't wait for him to finish. She strode across the room and pushed open the bedroom door.

Nathaniel stood by the window, his back to her, phone pressed to his ear. His usually immaculate hair was disheveled, and his shirt sleeves were rolled up haphazardly. The tension in his shoulders was palpable.

"—I don't care what it takes," he growled into the phone. "Find out who leaked this. Now."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Nathaniel."

He turned sharply, his stormy gray eyes locking onto hers. For a brief moment, something vulnerable flickered in his gaze before it was replaced by steely resolve. He ended the call.

"We need to talk," she said, her voice steady despite the turmoil inside her.

His jaw tightened. "Not now, Evelyn."

"Now," she insisted. "Before this spirals out of control."

A tense silence stretched between them. Then, with a sharp exhale, Nathaniel relented. "Fine. But we don't have much time."

As they faced each other, Evelyn couldn't shake the feeling that the ground beneath them was shifting—and not in their favor.

The engagement between Thomas and Penelope had been arranged years ago, though it was only in recent years that their families had pushed for the formal commitment.

Though engaged, they maintained separate lives, rarely crossing paths.

But now, if Thomas wanted to break it off, it wouldn’t just be about them—it would ignite a war between two powerful families.

Nathaniel took a slow sip of his coffee, his gaze sharp as he studied Thomas. "I hope you're not making this decision out of guilt—or pity for Charlotte. Neither of you deserves that."

As they spoke, Evelyn stirred awake.

She glanced at the blanket draped over her, her expression unreadable. Pushing it aside, she sat up and asked a passing maid for directions to the bathroom.

Inside, she stared at her reflection—dark circles under her eyes, her skin dull with exhaustion.

After splashing water on her face, she stepped back into the hallway just as hushed whispers reached her ears.

"Did you hear? Ms. Bennett was taken by some creep last night. Do you think something terrible happened?"

"Shh! Keep your voice down. If Mr. Ellsworth hears—"

"I wonder what Ms. Fairchild said to her yesterday. Why else would Ms. Bennett run out into that storm? How is she now?"

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

Her fingers curled into fists, a dangerous glint flashing in her eyes.

She strode toward the voices, cornering the two maids before they could slip away.

"Who," she demanded, voice low, "is Ms. Fairchild?"

The maids paled, exchanging panicked glances.

One stammered, "Mrs. Martin, please—we can’t—"

"Either you tell me," Evelyn said icily, "or I’ll have Thomas come down here and ask you himself."

The threat worked.

"Ms. Fairchild is Mr. Ellsworth’s fiancée," the bolder maid whispered. "Penelope Fairchild."

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. "Was she here yesterday? Did she speak to Charlotte?"

The maids hesitated, but under Evelyn’s unrelenting stare, one finally admitted, "She came by unexpectedly, said she was picking up some documents. We didn’t think much of it. But when she spoke to Ms. Bennett… there was shouting. We couldn’t hear what was said, but—"

"That’s enough." Evelyn cut her off sharply. "Go."

She knew Charlotte better than anyone. Strong on the outside, fragile beneath—one wrong word could shatter her.

Her boldness was armor, not strength.

And someone had just ripped it away.

Evelyn’s chest burned with fury.

Without another word, she stormed out, snatching Nathaniel’s car keys from the entryway.

By the time the men in the dining room heard the engine roar to life, she was already gone.

Nathaniel shot to his feet, striding outside. "What happened?" he demanded of the maid sweeping the porch.

The girl flinched. "Mrs. Martin—she just left!"



###Chapter 239

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the design, her mind racing with possibilities. The Martin Group project was her biggest challenge yet, and she was determined to prove herself—not just as Nathaniel's wife, but as a talented architect in her own right.

A knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Evelyn?" Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn straightened, smoothing her blouse. "Send him in."

Gregory Wilson strode in, his usual confident demeanor slightly frayed at the edges. "We have a problem."

Her stomach tightened. "What is it?"

"The Summit Realty deal. Sebastian Wilson just pulled out."

Evelyn's breath caught. That contract was crucial—not just for her firm, but for her reputation. "Why?"

Gregory exhaled sharply. "He claims our proposal lacks 'innovation.' But between us? I think he’s still bitter about losing the last bid to Nathaniel."

Evelyn clenched her jaw. This wasn’t just business—it was personal. Sebastian had been a rival long before she married Nathaniel, and his pride had taken a hit when Martin Group secured the waterfront project over Summit Realty.

"I’ll handle it," she said firmly.

Gregory raised a brow. "How?"

A slow smile curved her lips. "By giving him exactly what he wants—a design he can’t refuse."

Nathaniel glanced up from his desk as Samuel Yates entered, holding a tablet. "Sir, you have a meeting with the board in twenty minutes."

"Cancel it."

Samuel blinked. "But—"

"I need to see my wife."

There was an edge to Nathaniel’s voice that brooked no argument. Samuel nodded and retreated, but not before catching the dark flicker in his boss’s eyes. Something was wrong.

Nathaniel’s phone buzzed—a message from an unknown number.

"You should keep a closer eye on your wife. Summit Realty isn’t the only one watching her."

His grip on the phone turned deadly.

Isabella Davis adjusted her sunglasses as she stepped out of the sleek black car, her heels clicking against the pavement. The café was quiet, just as she preferred.

Vanessa, her agent, followed closely. "Are you sure about this?"

Isabella smirked. "Absolutely."

She spotted her contact already seated—a man with sharp features and a calculating gaze. Donovan Sinclair.

He leaned back, swirling his whiskey. "You’re late."

"Fashionably," she corrected, sliding into the seat opposite him. "Do you have what I asked for?"

Donovan slid a folder across the table. "Everything you need to ruin her."

Isabella opened it, her smile widening as she scanned the contents.

Evelyn Mitchell wouldn’t know what hit her.

"Mr. Martin, your wife just drove off without saying a word."

Nathaniel's expression darkened instantly. He pulled out his phone and dialed a number, his voice sharp with urgency. "Evelyn left Thomas's place. Have someone follow her immediately," he commanded before ending the call.

Thomas, who had been standing nearby, frowned. "Any updates?" he asked, his tone laced with concern.

"I don't know yet, but Evelyn left in a hurry. Something must have happened," Nathaniel replied, his jaw tight. A bitter realization settled in his chest—Evelyn didn’t trust him. The thought twisted his lips into a humorless smile.

The rain had stopped overnight in Mayby, leaving the November morning crisp and fresh. Despite winter’s approach, the air was surprisingly mild.

By noon, a sleek black Mercedes-Benz pulled up in front of Scarlett restaurant.

Evelyn stepped out, her stride confident as she entered the establishment.

"Excuse me," she said to the hostess, her voice polite but firm. "Is Ms. Fairchild here?"

The hostess nodded. "Yes, she arrived earlier."

"Perfect. I have an appointment with her," Evelyn lied smoothly.

"She's in the main dining area with two companions," the hostess informed her.

With a curt nod of thanks, Evelyn made her way inside.

She had left Thomas’s villa early that morning, determined to get answers. After a brief detour to the company, she had finally tracked down Penelope. Now, she wasn’t wasting another second.

The restaurant was still quiet, the lunch crowd yet to arrive.

In the center of the lobby, Evelyn’s gaze locked onto Penelope, who recognized her immediately.

Penelope stood, a practiced smile forming on her lips. She knew exactly who Evelyn was—Nathaniel Martin’s wife.

But before Penelope could utter a greeting, Evelyn seized her collar, yanking her forward with a sharp tug.

"Penelope," Evelyn hissed, her voice low and dangerous. "You’d better pray Charlotte is unharmed, or this will be the last meal you ever eat."

Penelope’s friends gasped, their eyes widening in shock.

"What the hell? Let her go!" one of them demanded.

Evelyn ignored them, her icy glare fixed solely on Penelope.

To her credit, Penelope didn’t flinch. She had been raised in wealth and power—she knew how to keep her composure.

"Are you Charlotte Bennett’s friend?" she asked calmly.

"That’s none of your business," Evelyn snapped. "Tell me what you said to her."

Her grip tightened, fingers digging into the fabric of Penelope’s blouse.

Penelope’s expression remained unreadable. "Did Ms. Bennett run to you and Thomas, crying about how I embarrassed her? But let’s be honest—her behavior was questionable. Shouldn’t she take responsibility for that?"

Evelyn’s eyes flashed with fury. Without thinking, she tightened her hold, her voice dropping to a lethal whisper.

"Tell me what you said to her, or I swear, you’ll regret it. And what exactly was ‘questionable’? Thomas is the one obsessed with their past. If Charlotte wanted him, you wouldn’t stand a chance."

Penelope’s smile turned condescending. "Ms. Mitchell, we’re supposed to be on the same side. Why are you defending a woman who broke up a marriage?"



###Chapter 240

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her blueprints. She tapped her pen against the desk, lost in thought. The Martin Group project was nearing its final stages, but something felt off.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel.

"Meeting in 20. Edward wants to discuss the final approval."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Edward Martin had been unusually involved in this project lately, and she couldn’t shake the feeling that his sudden interest wasn’t just about business.

She grabbed her tablet and headed toward the conference room. The hallway was unusually quiet, the usual hum of the office subdued. When she pushed open the door, Nathaniel was already there, his expression unreadable. Edward sat at the head of the table, his sharp gaze locking onto her the moment she entered.

"Ah, Evelyn. Right on time." His voice was smooth, but there was an edge to it.

She forced a polite smile. "Of course. Wouldn’t miss it."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened slightly, but he said nothing.

Edward leaned forward, steepling his fingers. "I’ve reviewed the latest designs. Impressive work, as always. However…" He paused, letting the word hang in the air. "There’s been a change in plans."

Evelyn’s grip on her tablet tightened. "What kind of change?"

"A rather significant one." Edward slid a folder toward her. "The client wants a complete redesign of the residential wing. More modern, more… exclusive."

She flipped open the folder, scanning the notes. Her stomach dropped. This wasn’t just a tweak—it was a complete overhaul. Weeks of work, gone.

Nathaniel finally spoke, his voice low. "When was this decided?"

Edward’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. "Last night. The client has very specific tastes."

Evelyn met Nathaniel’s gaze. There was something unspoken there, a silent understanding. This wasn’t just about the project.

She closed the folder. "I’ll need at least two weeks to revise everything."

Edward waved a hand dismissively. "You have one. The client is impatient."

The air in the room grew heavier. Evelyn clenched her teeth but nodded. "Understood."

As she turned to leave, Edward added, almost casually, "Oh, and Evelyn? Isabella will be joining the team as a consultant. Given her experience in luxury design, I’m sure she’ll be… invaluable."

Evelyn froze. Isabella. Nathaniel’s ex.

She didn’t look back, but she could feel Nathaniel’s tension radiating behind her.

This wasn’t just a change in plans.

This was a game.

And Edward had just made the first move.

"It doesn't matter whether there's another woman involved or not. If you have a problem with it, take it up with Thomas directly. But instead, you went after Charlotte and said things you had no right to say. Do you realize she’s missing because of you? It’s been an entire night. If anything happens to her, not only will I hold you accountable, but Thomas won’t let you walk away unscathed either."

Penelope stood frozen, her face drained of color.

She remembered her encounter with Charlotte—how she had lashed out, accusing her of chasing Thomas’s wealth and status. Charlotte had remained eerily calm, almost indifferent. Now, the weight of her actions pressed down on her.

Satisfied with Penelope’s silence, Evelyn released her grip on her collar, wiping her hands with a tissue from the nearby table as if brushing off something distasteful.

"Penelope, if you had fought for Thomas from the beginning instead of targeting her, we wouldn’t be having this conversation. Wanting to save your relationship isn’t wrong, but you picked the wrong person. She doesn’t even care about being with Thomas." Evelyn’s voice was cold, detached, as she turned to leave.

Back in her car, Evelyn sat motionless, lost in thought.

All night, she had debated calling Alexander Prescott.

If she did, he would descend upon Mayby immediately to search for Charlotte. But it would also expose her presence to the Prescott family—something Charlotte would never want.

With a frustrated sigh, Evelyn dismissed the idea.

Meanwhile, in the CEO’s office of Martin Group, Nathaniel received a call.

"Mr. Martin, your wife just left the Scarlet restaurant. Before that, she was at the company," Samuel reported.

"Did she go for lunch?"

"No. She came here to confront Ms. Penelope Fairchild—Thomas Ellsworth’s fiancée. There was an argument."

"Follow her. Make sure she’s safe."

Samuel suppressed a groan. He had been running around all night, and now he had to tail Evelyn first thing in the morning. Exhaustion was creeping in, but orders were orders.

After ensuring Evelyn returned to her apartment without incident, Samuel reported back to Nathaniel and was finally permitted to return to the office.

Evelyn visited her grandmother Beatrice for lunch, though her nerves left her appetite nonexistent.

Beatrice frowned, studying her granddaughter’s weary expression. "You’ve lost weight. Did you not sleep at all last night? You look exhausted."

"I’m fine," Evelyn replied smoothly. "The doctor said overeating isn’t good for the baby anyway."

"You’re pale. Something’s troubling you." Beatrice’s concern deepened.

Evelyn forced a smile. "Maybe the rain kept me up. What about you? Did you sleep well?"

"Like a log until dawn," Beatrice answered before gently pressing, "You need to take care of yourself, especially now. That child is growing every day. Even if you wanted to keep it from Nathaniel, you won’t be able to hide it much longer."



###Chapter 241

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Pineview Villa, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. Evelyn stretched lazily in bed, the silk sheets cool against her skin. Beside her, Nathaniel was already awake, his piercing blue eyes studying her with quiet intensity.

"You're staring," she murmured, a playful smile tugging at her lips.

"I can't help it," he replied, his voice rough with sleep. "You're breathtaking."

Evelyn rolled her eyes but couldn't suppress the warmth spreading through her chest. Three years of marriage, and he still looked at her like she was the only woman in the world.

Their peaceful moment was shattered by the shrill ring of Nathaniel's phone. He frowned as he glanced at the caller ID—Samuel Yates, his ever-efficient secretary.

"Speak," Nathaniel answered, his tone shifting to businesslike sharpness.

Evelyn watched as his expression darkened. Something was wrong.

She didn't have to wait long for an explanation. The moment he ended the call, Nathaniel turned to her, jaw tight. "There's been an incident at the Martin Group headquarters. A major investor just pulled out, and the board is in chaos."

Evelyn sat up, instantly alert. "How bad is it?"

"Bad enough that I need to handle this personally." He pressed a kiss to her forehead before striding toward the walk-in closet. "I'll be back as soon as I can."

She nodded, though unease settled in her stomach. The Martin Group had faced challenges before, but Nathaniel rarely looked this troubled.

As he dressed, Evelyn's phone buzzed. A message from Gregory Wilson, her business partner at the architecture firm.

"Emergency meeting in 30. Summit Realty is making moves."

Her fingers tightened around the device. Summit Realty—Sebastian Wilson's company—had been circling their projects for months, looking for weaknesses. If they were acting now, it couldn’t be a coincidence.

Evelyn quickly typed back. "On my way."

She threw on a tailored blazer and heels, her mind racing. The timing was too perfect—Martin Group in turmoil, Summit Realty making a play. Someone was orchestrating this.

And she had a sinking suspicion she knew who.

Downstairs, Alfred stood waiting with her car keys. "Will you be joining Mr. Martin, madam?"

"No," Evelyn said, slipping into her coat. "I have my own fire to put out."

As she stepped outside, the crisp morning air did little to calm her nerves. Whatever was coming, she and Nathaniel would face it together—just like they always had.

But first, she needed answers.

And there was only one person who could give them to her.

Isabella Davis.

Evelyn offered a faint smile and deftly shifted the conversation, engaging Beatrice in light banter until lunch concluded. Then she retreated to her apartment.

After a quick shower and change of clothes, the exhaustion from the previous night finally weighed her down. Reluctantly, she sank into bed, surrendering to much-needed rest.

Meanwhile, at the Martin estate, Nathaniel finished his work and prepared to leave for Evelyn’s place. Just as he stepped out of his office, Samuel intercepted him urgently. "Mr. Martin, they’ve found the suspect. He’s been taken to the police station."

A flicker of relief crossed Nathaniel’s expression before he asked, "Has Thomas been informed?"

"Mr. Ellsworth is aware and already on his way there. Should we join him? Given that Ms. Bennett is your wife’s closest friend, what would you like to do?" Samuel suggested cautiously.

Nathaniel considered for a brief moment before responding, "Clear my schedule for the afternoon."

Samuel nodded and made a quick call as they headed toward the elevator.

Roughly thirty minutes later, Nathaniel arrived at the police station.

Samuel’s contacts had been waiting for them and immediately provided an update. "Mr. Martin, the suspect is in the interrogation room."

"Where’s Thomas?" Nathaniel inquired.

"Mr. Ellsworth just went in."

Inside the interrogation room, Thomas had already rolled up his sleeves, his black shirt the only thing left neat as he loomed over the suspect with barely restrained fury.

The officers had conveniently found reasons to step out, leaving Thomas to conduct his own version of questioning.

The man was already sporting bruises. Nathaniel ignored them and cut straight to the point. "Tell us where Charlotte is."

"I—I don’t know! I swear, I don’t know her!" the man stammered, his voice trembling.

"Stop lying!" Thomas seized the man’s collar and delivered a brutal punch.

Nathaniel watched impassively before warning, "If you keep this up, you’ll kill him before we get any answers."

But Thomas wasn’t listening. He landed several more kicks before pausing at Nathaniel’s presence. Frustration boiled over as he snapped, "Nathaniel, tell me what to do! If this had happened to Evelyn—"

Nathaniel’s icy glare silenced him mid-sentence. "Sorry. I shouldn’t have said that."

Ignoring the outburst, Nathaniel observed the interrogation process. Through relentless questioning and photo identification, the suspect finally cracked.

"Fine! I gave her a ride. I thought about taking advantage, but she fought back too hard. I didn’t want trouble. She just jumped out of the car and vanished," the man confessed.

With the lead in hand, they launched a search for Charlotte.

Within half an hour, Samuel returned with news. "Mr. Martin, we’ve found information on Ms. Bennett!"

Nathaniel instructed Samuel to inform Thomas before driving straight to Evelyn’s apartment.

He knocked firmly. When she answered, she was still groggy from sleep. Her gaze was steady, her tone eerily calm. "What do you want?"

Though Nathaniel’s brow furrowed slightly, he didn’t comment. Instead, he delivered the update. "We have news about Charlotte."



###Chapter 242

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew over the keyboard as she adjusted the 3D rendering of the new waterfront development project. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint aroma of her jasmine perfume.

"Evelyn?" Gabrielle's voice came through the intercom. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

She sighed, saving her work. "Send him in."

Gregory Wilson strode into her office with his usual confident gait, his tailored navy suit accentuating his broad shoulders. "You look exhausted," he remarked, dropping a stack of files on her desk. "Did you pull another all-nighter?"

"Just finishing the revisions for the Martin Group proposal," Evelyn replied, rubbing her temples. The tension between her shoulder blades had become a constant companion these past weeks.

Gregory's expression darkened. "You're still working with Nathaniel Martin? After everything that's happened?"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her coffee mug. The ceramic felt suddenly cold against her skin. "It's business, Gregory. Nothing more."

"Is it?" He leaned against her desk, his piercing gaze unsettling. "Because from where I'm standing, it looks personal. Especially with Isabella Davis back in the picture."

The mention of Nathaniel's ex-girlfriend sent an unexpected pang through Evelyn's chest. She schooled her features into professional neutrality. "Our firm won the bid fair and square. I won't let personal matters interfere with our biggest project yet."

Gregory studied her for a long moment before sighing. "Just be careful, Evelyn. The Martins play by different rules." He tapped the files. "These are the zoning permits for the downtown project. Thought you'd want to review them before the meeting tomorrow."

As the door closed behind him, Evelyn exhaled shakily. Her phone buzzed with a text from Nathaniel: "Dinner tonight? 8pm at Le Ciel. We need to talk."

Her thumb hovered over the screen. The last time they'd spoken, words had been exchanged that couldn't be taken back. The memory of their argument in his penthouse - voices raised, accusations flung - still burned fresh in her mind.

Before she could respond, another message appeared: "It's about Isabella. She's coming back to town."

The coffee turned bitter in Evelyn's mouth. Outside her window, storm clouds gathered on the horizon, mirroring the turmoil in her chest. Somewhere in the distance, thunder rumbled - a warning of the tempest to come.

"Where is she?" Evelyn's reaction was immediate, her fingers digging into Nathaniel's arm as she spoke, her voice trembling with barely contained emotion. "Is she...hurt?" The words caught in her throat, thick with worry.

She nearly choked on the question, her eyes burning with unshed tears.

Nathaniel's response was quiet but firm. "She's staying at a motel downtown. I've already alerted Thomas. We should get there before he does."

Evelyn nodded frantically, already turning toward the door, but Nathaniel caught her wrist. "At least grab your coat. It's freezing outside."

Though she huffed in impatience, she didn’t argue, snatching her jacket before following him out.

Minutes later, they were speeding toward the motel. Nathaniel drove with controlled urgency, weaving through traffic without reckless abandon.

The moment the car stopped, Evelyn was already unbuckling, flinging the door open before Nathaniel could even cut the engine.

Samuel had been waiting outside, and upon spotting Evelyn, he rushed forward. "Ms. Mitchell—"

"Take me to her. Now," Evelyn demanded, her voice sharp with urgency.

Samuel glanced at Nathaniel, who gave a curt nod, before leading Evelyn inside and up to the second floor.

"The door's unlocked. Ms. Bennett is inside—she’s just had some soup," Samuel informed her before Evelyn pushed the door open without hesitation.

Charlotte sat at the small table, a half-finished bowl in front of her. When she looked up, her eyes were red-rimmed, exhaustion etched into her pale face.

"Charlotte," Evelyn breathed, her voice softening as she crossed the room in quick strides. She scanned her friend from head to toe—physically unharmed, but drained. "What happened? Why didn’t you call me?"

Evelyn’s own voice was hoarse, the strain of the last few days evident.

Charlotte swallowed hard, her fingers tightening around the spoon. "I got caught in the storm. Fever hit me hard. I’ve been holed up here for two days. I wanted to reach out, but..." She hesitated, then whispered, "I was afraid Thomas would track you down and cause a scene. I thought—I thought I’d wait until I was better before contacting you."

Then, without warning, Charlotte lurched forward, wrapping her arms around Evelyn in a tight embrace. "I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you."

Evelyn exhaled shakily, blinking back tears as she held her friend close. After a moment, she pulled back, cupping Charlotte’s face. "You’re really okay?"

Charlotte managed a weak smile. "I’m fine."

Evelyn’s expression hardened. "The driver who picked you up was arrested. You got lucky this time. Don’t ever take risks like that again. Promise me."

Charlotte flinched at the mention of the driver—Samuel had filled her in earlier. But her biggest fear had been Thomas finding her. That night, she hadn’t dared call the police or ask for help.

"I promise," Charlotte murmured, squeezing Evelyn’s hand. Then, hesitantly, she asked, "Did... Alexander reach out to you?"

Evelyn nodded. "Once. He didn’t seem suspicious. Don’t worry."

Before they could say more, a sharp knock interrupted them. Samuel’s voice filtered through the door. "Mr. Martin, Mr. Ellsworth is here. He’s asking to see Ms. Bennett."

###Chapter 243

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, the weight of the past weeks pressed down on her shoulders. The air was thick with unspoken tension, the kind that made her fingers curl into fists at her sides.

Nathaniel stood by the fireplace, his expression unreadable. The flickering flames cast shadows across his sharp features, making him look more like a statue than the man she had fallen in love with.

"You're late," he said, his voice low but edged with something she couldn’t quite place.

Evelyn resisted the urge to roll her eyes. "Traffic," she replied, keeping her tone even. She wasn’t about to let him dictate the mood of this conversation.

Isabella, standing near the window, turned to face them. The sunlight streaming in behind her made her look almost ethereal, but Evelyn knew better. There was nothing angelic about the woman who had once held Nathaniel’s heart—and, if rumors were to be believed, still did.

"I didn’t realize this was a family meeting," Isabella said, her voice dripping with false sweetness.

Evelyn forced a smile. "Neither did I."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. "We need to talk. All of us."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. She had known this was coming, but that didn’t make it any easier. The last few weeks had been a whirlwind of secrets, half-truths, and betrayals. And now, it seemed, they were finally going to address the elephant in the room.

She crossed her arms. "Fine. Let’s talk."

Nathaniel hesitated, his gaze flickering between her and Isabella. For a moment, Evelyn wondered if he would back down. But then he straightened, his jaw set.

"There’s something you both need to know," he began, his voice steady despite the storm brewing in his eyes.

Evelyn braced herself. Whatever he was about to say, she had a feeling it would change everything.

And she was right.

The words that left his lips shattered the fragile peace they had been clinging to, leaving behind a silence so heavy it was suffocating.

Evelyn’s breath caught in her throat.

This wasn’t just a conversation.

This was the beginning of the end.

Evelyn studied Charlotte's face carefully. "Is that what you really think? Do you want to see him?"

For a long moment, Charlotte remained silent, her expression unreadable. Then, with a strained smile, she finally spoke. "It's not about wanting or not wanting. Thomas and I... we need to talk. If we don't clear things up now, he might pull the same stunt again. I've spent the last two days running from the truth, but hiding won't change anything."

She had tried to soften the blow, to make excuses—but in the end, reality couldn’t be avoided.

Running was just a temporary escape, not a solution.

Evelyn nodded in understanding. "Eat first. I'll go let him in."

Charlotte picked up her fork, though her appetite had long vanished. Her thoughts were heavy, tangled in a mess she wasn’t sure how to unravel.

Outside, Nathaniel stepped out of the elevator just as Evelyn reached the hallway. His face was drawn, exhaustion evident in the tightness of his jaw.

The moment their eyes met, Nathaniel demanded, voice rough with worry, "How is she?"

Evelyn didn’t answer immediately. Instead, her tone turned icy. "Thomas, if you ever lock someone up against their will again, I will make sure you pay for it. No matter what it takes."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, nodding. "I know. I won’t."

Evelyn’s gaze remained hard. "Do you understand why she ran? Why she didn’t ask for help, even when she was in danger?" Nathaniel met her eyes, his own dark with realization. "Because of Penelope. If you can’t control your fiancée, then stay the hell away from Charlotte."

With that, Evelyn walked past him, leaving Nathaniel standing there, the weight of her words pressing down on him.

He hesitated outside the door, his hand hovering over the handle.

All this time, he had assumed Charlotte left because she didn’t want him anymore. But he had never considered Penelope’s role in this.

Swallowing hard, he finally pushed the door open.

Meanwhile, downstairs, Evelyn found Nathaniel sitting on the couch, his posture tense.

The moment he saw her, he stood. "Is Charlotte alright?"

Evelyn crossed her arms, her voice cool. "Are you actually concerned, or are you just here to make excuses for Thomas?"

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Evelyn, I won’t defend what he did. I know you’re angry I didn’t step in sooner. I’m sorry for making you worry. But even if we interfere, do you really think it’ll fix anything between them?"

Evelyn knew he was right—some wounds couldn’t be healed by outsiders. But that didn’t make it any easier to watch someone she cared about suffer.

Her reply was clipped. "You don’t need to apologize. Charlotte’s safety isn’t your responsibility. There’s nothing wrong with staying out of it."

Nathaniel studied her, his voice dropping. "Is that really how you feel, Evelyn?"
###Chapter 244

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She traced the outline of his jaw with her fingertips, marveling at how peaceful he looked.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Mrs. Martin?" Alfred's voice was muffled through the door. "Mr. Edward has requested your presence in the study."

Evelyn sighed. Edward Martin, Nathaniel's grandfather, had been increasingly insistent on discussing the family's latest business venture. She slipped out of bed quietly, careful not to disturb Nathaniel, and dressed quickly in a tailored navy dress.

The study was bathed in warm light when she entered. Edward sat behind his mahogany desk, his sharp eyes assessing her as she approached.

"Good morning, Evelyn," he greeted, though his tone lacked warmth.

"Good morning, Grandfather," she replied, forcing a polite smile.

"I trust you've reviewed the proposal for the waterfront project?" He pushed a thick folder toward her.

Evelyn hesitated. "I have, but I still have concerns about the environmental impact. The wetlands—"

"Are irrelevant," Edward cut in. "Progress waits for no one, my dear. The board expects this to move forward without delay."

Her fingers tightened around the folder. "With all due respect, rushing this could have irreversible consequences. I’d like to propose alternative designs that—"

"Enough." Edward's voice was icy. "Your sentimentality is clouding your judgment. This is business, not one of your charity projects."

Evelyn's jaw clenched, but she held her tongue. Arguing further would be futile.

Just then, the door swung open, and Nathaniel strode in, his expression unreadable.

"Grandfather," he said coolly. "I believe we agreed to discuss this as a team."

Edward waved a dismissive hand. "There’s nothing to discuss. The decision is final."

Nathaniel's gaze flicked to Evelyn, noting the tension in her posture. "Then perhaps we should revisit the terms. Evelyn’s expertise is invaluable here."

Edward scoffed. "Sentiment has no place in business, Nathaniel. You of all people should know that."

The air grew thick with unspoken tension. Evelyn exhaled slowly, her mind racing. She knew Edward’s stubbornness well, but this time, she wouldn’t back down.

"Very well," she said, lifting her chin. "If the board insists on proceeding as planned, then I’ll present my concerns directly to them."

Edward’s eyes narrowed. "You’d defy me?"

"I’d protect what’s right," she countered.

Nathaniel stepped closer to her, his presence a silent show of support.

For a long moment, Edward studied them both, his expression unreadable. Then, with a curt nod, he rose from his chair.

"Fine. Present your case. But don’t expect miracles."

As he left the room, Evelyn released a shaky breath.

Nathaniel turned to her, his hand finding hers. "You okay?"

She squeezed his fingers. "I will be. But this isn’t over."

He nodded, his eyes dark with determination. "No, it’s not."

Outside, the wind rustled through the trees, carrying the faint scent of rain. A storm was coming—and not just the weather kind.

"Nathaniel, am I wrong?" Evelyn's voice trembled slightly. "You said it yourself. I kept pushing you to find Charlotte because she's my best friend. Now, I realize how selfish I was being. Maybe you were right all along."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. His dark eyes bore into hers, searching for something she wasn't willing to show. "Evelyn, listen to yourself. Do you really think I can't see through you? You're blaming me in your heart, yet you refuse to admit it. Ask yourself—do you truly believe what you're saying?"

"I meant every word," she insisted, lifting her chin. "Whether you believe me or not doesn’t change that."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, a storm of emotions swirling inside her. Anger? No, she didn’t think so. There was nothing to be angry about. Charlotte had been found, safe and unharmed. So why did she feel this suffocating weight in her chest?

Pretending everything was fine felt like swallowing glass—painful and impossible.

The air between them grew thick with tension, heavy enough to suffocate. Silence stretched, unbearable.

After what felt like an eternity, Evelyn turned to leave. There was no point in dragging this out.

But Nathaniel’s hand shot out, gripping her wrist. His touch was firm, unyielding.

"Where do you think you're going?" His voice was low, dangerous. "Planning to disappear like Charlotte did?"

Evelyn stiffened. She met his gaze, her own eyes flashing with defiance. "What, am I not allowed to leave now? You have your men tailing me everywhere. They’ll report back to you the second I step out the door. Why bother asking?"

Her voice cracked, raw with emotion. She tried to pull away, but Nathaniel held fast.

His expression darkened, shadows flickering across his face.

Evelyn’s breath came faster, her body coiled tight like a spring. Then, without warning, the world tilted. A wave of dizziness crashed over her, her vision blurring at the edges.

She barely registered Nathaniel’s arms catching her before everything went black.

Nathaniel acted instantly. "Samuel!" he barked, his voice sharp with urgency. "Get the car. Now."

Samuel, waiting outside, sprang into action. Within seconds, the car door was open, and Nathaniel was sliding into the backseat with Evelyn limp in his arms. The tires screeched as they sped toward the hospital.

Nathaniel’s grip on Evelyn never loosened. His entire body was rigid, his mind racing. The drive felt endless, though it couldn’t have been more than minutes.

At the hospital, Evelyn was rushed into the emergency room. The doctors moved quickly, running tests. The diagnosis came swiftly—hypoglycemia from exhaustion. Given her condition, they proceeded with extra caution.

Eventually, she was settled into a private room, still unconscious. The doctor adjusted her IV before turning to Nathaniel. "She’s severely fatigued. Let her rest. When she wakes up, she’ll need proper nourishment. We’ll keep her overnight for observation."

Nathaniel nodded stiffly, his eyes never leaving Evelyn’s pale face.

She looked fragile, her usual fiery spirit dimmed. For the first time in hours, her body was finally at rest.



###Chapter 245

The moment Nathaniel stepped into the room, the air shifted. Evelyn could feel it—the tension, the unspoken words hanging between them like a storm waiting to break. His jaw was set, his dark eyes unreadable, but she knew him well enough to recognize the turmoil beneath that composed exterior.

She tightened her grip on the blueprints in her hands, the edges crumpling slightly under her fingers. "You're back early," she said, keeping her voice steady.

His gaze flickered to the papers in her grasp before meeting hers. "We need to talk."

A cold knot formed in her stomach. Those words never preceded anything good. Still, she forced a calm nod. "Alright."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. "I met with Isabella today."

Evelyn's breath hitched. Isabella—his ex, the woman who had once held his heart before Evelyn came into the picture. The woman who had never truly left the shadows of their relationship.

"And?" Evelyn prompted, though she wasn’t sure she wanted to hear the answer.

"She’s in trouble," Nathaniel admitted, his voice low. "Serious trouble. Someone’s threatening her, and she has nowhere else to turn."

Evelyn’s fingers twitched. Part of her wanted to reach out, to reassure him, but another part—the part that still remembered the pain of his past with Isabella—held her back. "What does that have to do with us?"

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "Because whoever is after her is connected to the Martin Group. To me."

The weight of his words settled over her. This wasn’t just about Isabella—it was about their family, their future. And if someone was bold enough to target someone from Nathaniel’s past, what did that mean for them now?

Evelyn swallowed hard. "What are you going to do?"

His eyes locked onto hers, fierce and determined. "I’m going to fix this. But I need to know—are you with me?"

The question hung between them, heavy with unspoken implications. Trust had always been their foundation, but this—this was testing it in ways they hadn’t faced before.

Evelyn took a deep breath. Then, slowly, she nodded. "Always."

Nathaniel’s shoulders relaxed slightly, but the tension in the room didn’t dissipate. Because they both knew—this was only the beginning.

And whatever storm was coming, it would change everything.

Nathaniel stood motionless beside the hospital bed, his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn's pale face. His voice was barely above a whisper when he asked, "Is it just exhaustion?"

The doctor adjusted his glasses and nodded. "Yes, but given your wife's condition, she needs extra care. Mr. Martin, she shouldn't push herself too hard—it's risky for both her and the baby. Even though the first trimester is over, caution is still necessary."

Nathaniel froze.

His jaw tightened as he stared at the doctor, his voice rough with disbelief. "She's... pregnant?"

The doctor blinked in surprise. "Nearly four months along, though it's not visibly obvious yet. You... didn't know?"

Samuel, standing nearby, watched Nathaniel's reaction carefully. Nathaniel didn't respond. He simply thanked the doctor mechanically before the man left.

Left alone in the room, Nathaniel couldn't tear his eyes away from Evelyn.

Four months.

The realization hit him like a physical blow. How had he not noticed? How had she not told him?

His mind raced—was this why she had been so distant? Why she had insisted on divorce despite everything?

A bitter smirk twisted his lips.

If she knew, why keep it from me?

What game is she playing?

The thought of her walking away, carrying his child without a word, sent a dark shadow across his expression.

Samuel cleared his throat softly. "Mr. Martin, should I arrange for some food before Mrs. Martin wakes?"

Nathaniel barely registered the question. "Do that," he muttered, his mind still reeling.

As Samuel left, the room plunged into silence. Nathaniel turned toward the window, but his thoughts were interrupted by his phone ringing. He answered sharply. "What?"

Thomas's concerned voice came through. "I heard about Evelyn. Is she alright?"

"She's fine," Nathaniel replied curtly. Then, without preamble, he demanded, "Is Charlotte there? I need to speak with her."

Confused, Thomas handed the phone over.

Charlotte's voice was laced with worry. "How is Evelyn? Are you at the hospital?"

She knew. Nathaniel could hear it in her tone.

His grip on the phone tightened. "She's pregnant. Four months. You knew."

A heavy silence followed.

Finally, Charlotte exhaled. "If you're still planning to be with Isabella, then let Evelyn go. She doesn’t want her child caught in the middle of this."

Nathaniel's chest tightened. "So she'd rather hide my child from me?"

"I'm not here to argue, Mr. Martin. Just think carefully about what you really want. Evelyn won’t raise this child in a broken family."

Before Nathaniel could respond, a soft rustling came from the bed.

Evelyn was waking up.

Nathaniel ended the call abruptly.

He moved closer, his voice uncharacteristically gentle. "How are you feeling?"



###Chapter 246

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. The warmth of Nathaniel’s arm draped over her waist was comforting, yet her mind was already racing with the day’s tasks.

She carefully slipped out of bed, not wanting to disturb him. The soft click of the door echoed as she stepped into the hallway, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet.

Downstairs, Alfred was already setting the breakfast table. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted with a slight bow.

"Morning, Alfred," Evelyn replied, pouring herself a cup of coffee. The rich aroma filled her senses, momentarily grounding her.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Gregory. "The client moved the meeting to 10 AM. They want to see the revised blueprints before signing."

Evelyn sighed. That gave her less than two hours to finalize the changes.

Just as she was about to respond, Nathaniel’s voice came from behind her. "You’re up early."

She turned to see him leaning against the doorway, his dark hair slightly tousled, his shirt unbuttoned at the top. Even half-asleep, he exuded an effortless charm.

"Work never waits," she said with a small smile.

He stepped closer, his fingers brushing against hers as he took the coffee cup from her hand. "Neither do I." His voice was low, teasing.

Evelyn rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress the flutter in her chest. "You’re impossible."

"Yet here you are," he murmured, pressing a kiss to her temple before stealing a sip of her coffee.

The moment was interrupted by the shrill ring of Nathaniel’s phone. He frowned at the caller ID—Richard Martin.

Evelyn watched as his expression darkened. "You should take that."

He hesitated, then answered with a curt, "Father."

The conversation was brief, tense. When Nathaniel hung up, his jaw was clenched.

"What’s wrong?" Evelyn asked.

"Family dinner tonight," he said flatly. "Mandatory."

She knew what that meant—another evening of veiled insults and power plays under the guise of civility.

Evelyn reached for his hand, squeezing it gently. "We’ll get through it."

His grip tightened around hers, his eyes searching hers for reassurance. "I know."

But beneath his calm exterior, she could see the storm brewing. And she knew—whatever was coming, it wouldn’t be easy.

Meanwhile, across town, Isabella Davis adjusted the strap of her designer dress as she stepped out of her penthouse. Her phone buzzed—Vanessa’s name flashed on the screen.

"The press is ready. Are you?"

A slow smirk curved Isabella’s lips as she typed back. "Always."

Tonight, the game would change. And she intended to win.

Evelyn's face was unreadable.

But beneath the covers, her fingers curled into tight fists. When she looked at Nathaniel, she searched his expression for any hint of emotion, but as always, he gave nothing away.

Nathaniel helped her sit up, his voice soft as he spoke. "Samuel went to get you something to eat. Are you hungry?"

Evelyn's brows drew together slightly, her gaze lingering on him.

Nathaniel noticed her scrutiny. "Why are you staring at me like that?"

Her lashes fluttered, thoughts racing.

Does he really not know? Despite her doubts, she stayed silent, unsure how to respond.

Before she could gather her thoughts, Nathaniel spoke again. "Evelyn, is there something you want to say to me?"

Her stomach dropped.

He knew.

He had to know she was pregnant.

Otherwise, why would he ask her that?

But she had no words.

Hiding the pregnancy hadn’t been a whim—she had been terrified of what would happen if Nathaniel found out about the baby.

Evelyn had tried to avoid this moment, but she knew she couldn’t run forever.

Nathaniel pressed on. "You're pregnant. Why didn’t you tell me? Evelyn, I’m the father. It’s unfair to keep this from me."

Her lips pressed into a thin line, her gaze fixed on nothing in particular.

After a long pause, she finally spoke. "What would you have done if I told you? Nathaniel, we were talking about divorce before Isabella woke up. Should I have used this baby to force you to stay? Would you have given up your chance with Isabella for a child?"

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. He realized then—she didn’t trust him. The silence between them grew thick, suffocating.

Evelyn’s emotions churned, fueled by Isabella’s accusations.

She forced herself to stay calm. "You want me to tell you, so you can raise this child while marrying Isabella? I would never let someone else raise my baby. So what was the point in telling you?"

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "So that’s what you think of me? You took away my right to know my own child based on assumptions?"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes, meeting his gaze. His face was calm, but his tone was deadly serious.

Nathaniel exhaled. "Evelyn, believe me or not, I never once considered having a child with Isabella. Even when we were discussing divorce, the thought never crossed my mind."

Silence settled between them again.

Evelyn wrestled with conflicting thoughts. Was Nathaniel telling the truth? Had Isabella lied?

She didn’t trust Isabella over Nathaniel, but her words had still influenced her decision.

The tension in the hospital room was unbearable, broken only by their quiet breaths.

Finally, Nathaniel spoke again, his voice firm. "Evelyn, I swear to you—what you’re afraid of will never happen."

She stayed silent.

Then, a knock at the door. Samuel returned with soup.

Nathaniel sat back, waiting for her to eat.

But Evelyn only managed half the bowl before pushing it away.

"I’m done," she murmured, her mind too full to focus on food.

###Chapter 247

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her blueprints. She rubbed her temples, trying to focus, but her mind kept drifting back to last night’s argument with Nathaniel.

Her phone buzzed—Isabella’s name flashed on the screen.

Evelyn hesitated before swiping to answer. "What do you want?"

Isabella’s voice was smooth, almost mocking. "Just checking in. You sounded… tense last night."

Evelyn’s grip tightened around her pen. "If you called to gloat, save it."

A soft laugh. "Oh, Evelyn. I don’t need to gloat. Nathaniel’s already doing that for me."

The words stung. Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Is there a point to this call?"

"Actually, yes." Isabella’s tone shifted, turning businesslike. "I heard about your latest project. Summit Realty’s deal, right? Such a shame if something… happened to it."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold. "What did you do?"

"Me? Nothing." A pause. "Yet."

The line went dead.

Evelyn shot up from her chair, knocking over her coffee. Gabrielle rushed in, eyes wide. "Evelyn? What’s wrong?"

She grabbed her coat. "Get Gregory on the phone. Now."

Nathaniel stood at the edge of the construction site, surveying the progress. The new Martin Group tower was nearly complete, but his thoughts were elsewhere.

Samuel approached, clearing his throat. "Sir, the board is expecting your decision on the merger."

Nathaniel barely glanced at the documents. "Tell them I’ll handle it."

Samuel hesitated. "And… Evelyn called earlier. She sounded upset."

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched. "Not now."

His phone buzzed—Isabella. He ignored it.

Then a second message lit up the screen: "You should really answer. It’s about Evelyn."

His thumb hovered over the call button.

A gust of wind sent dust swirling around him, mirroring the chaos in his mind.

Gregory met Evelyn at the Summit Realty offices, his expression grim. "We have a problem."

Sebastian Wilson, the CEO, stood with arms crossed. "Your designs were leaked. The investors are pulling out."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. "Leaked? How?"

Sebastian’s gaze darkened. "That’s what I’d like to know. Unless you’re working with someone who wants this deal to fail?"

The accusation hung in the air.

Gregory stepped forward. "We’ll fix this."

Evelyn’s phone buzzed—Nathaniel. She silenced it.

First, she had to salvage her career.

Then, she’d deal with her marriage.

Nathaniel's expression softened as he murmured, "You need to eat more."

With playful defiance, he picked up the spoon and brought it toward her lips.

Evelyn stiffened, caught off guard. "What are you doing?" she demanded.

Nathaniel arched a brow. "What? You're not finishing your food. Someone has to." His tone carried a teasing edge, laced with mock offense.

A flush crept up her neck as she looked away, unsettled by his boldness.

After the meal, exhaustion pulled Evelyn into sleep. Nathaniel remained beside her, only stepping away briefly to call his grandfather.

"Grandpa, Evelyn's pregnant. You got your wish," Nathaniel announced.

Edward's voice sharpened with surprise. "How did you find out?"

Nathaniel caught the implication instantly. "So you already knew?"

Edward scoffed. "Evelyn told me, not you. Maybe you should ask yourself why." His tone turned stern. "Now that you know, don’t mess this up. I want a great-grandchild, but if you lose Evelyn, this family falls apart anyway."

Nathaniel clenched his jaw, his gaze dropping to Evelyn’s peaceful face. The urge to shake her awake and demand answers burned in his chest.

Meanwhile, Victoria snatched the phone from Edward, her excitement bubbling over. "How is Evelyn? The baby? I’m coming to see her right now—"

Nathaniel cut her off smoothly. "Give it a few days. Your enthusiasm might overwhelm her."

Victoria gasped. "Excuse me?"

"You're too worked up. Calm down first," Nathaniel advised dryly.

She laughed but relented. "Fine. But if you don’t treat her right, you’ll regret it."

Once the call ended, Victoria whirled on Edward, indignant. "Why didn’t you tell me? You and Evelyn kept this a secret from the rest of us!"

Edward coughed awkwardly, but Richard intervened before she could press further.

Still, the news was cause for celebration. The timing didn’t matter—only that the family would grow.

Back in the dim hospital room, Evelyn stirred awake, realization dawning. Nathaniel knows.

Her thoughts tangled. She refused to stay in a hollow marriage just for a child.

No.

I won’t do that.

Her resolve hardened, eyes glinting with determination.

Nathaniel’s voice broke through her thoughts. "Hungry? What do you want to eat?"

She met his gaze evenly. "Nathaniel, you don’t have to stay. I’m fine—just tired. The baby doesn’t change my decision about us. We can co-parent, but not as a couple."

She needed him to understand—she was keeping the baby, but not him.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened, something raw flickering beneath the surface. "You think I’m only here because of the child?" His voice was dangerously quiet.



###Chapter 248

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort in the Maldives. The design was ambitious, but she thrived on challenges.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Evelyn, do you have a minute?" Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in, holding a tablet.

"Of course," Evelyn replied, leaning back in her chair.

Gabrielle stepped inside, her expression hesitant. "I just received a call from Mr. Wilson. He wants to discuss the budget revisions for the Maldives project. He sounded... urgent."

Evelyn sighed, rubbing her temples. Gregory Wilson, her business partner, had been increasingly difficult lately. His constant nitpicking was wearing on her patience. "Tell him I'll call him back in an hour. I need to finish reviewing these plans first."

Gabrielle nodded and turned to leave, then paused. "Oh, and Nathaniel called earlier. He said he’d be home late tonight—another board meeting."

Evelyn’s lips tightened. Lately, Nathaniel had been drowning in work, their time together dwindling to stolen moments. She missed him.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Isabella.

"We need to talk. It’s important."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. Isabella, Nathaniel’s ex, had been lurking in the shadows of their marriage like a persistent ghost. What could she possibly want now?

Before she could reply, another notification popped up—this time from Charlotte, her best friend.

"Emergency girl talk. Café Noir in 30?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. It seemed the universe had conspired to derail her day.

Gathering her things, she shot a quick text to Nathaniel.

"We need to talk tonight. No excuses."

Whatever storm was brewing, she wouldn’t face it alone.

Evelyn's silence spoke volumes, her lips pressed into a thin line as she avoided Nathaniel's piercing gaze.

His voice was deceptively calm, but the undercurrent of tension was unmistakable. "Evelyn, do you honestly believe I'm only here because of the baby?"

Her breath hitched.

What was he implying?

Was there something more between them—something beyond obligation, beyond the child binding them together?

She refused to let herself hope. Instead, she met his eyes, her own unreadable.

Nathaniel exhaled, his stern expression softening as he reached for her hand. "Evelyn, let's not go through with the divorce. Don’t you want our child to grow up with both parents?"

Her pulse stuttered. For a moment, she couldn’t speak.

She knew why he was saying this. It wasn’t about her. It was about the pregnancy.

And that realization carved a hollow ache in her chest.

If he had said these words months ago—when she still foolishly believed their marriage could be salvaged—she might have melted into his arms.

But not now.

Not when she had already accepted the truth.

Nathaniel didn’t love her. He never had. No matter how much she tried, that fact wouldn’t change.

And she refused to humiliate herself any further.

Evelyn remained silent, her fingers curling into the sheets. Sensing her resistance, Nathaniel smoothly changed the subject. "I’ll have Alfred bring you something to eat."

She nodded faintly, and the room lapsed into an uneasy quiet.

Despite his attentiveness—despite the way he hovered near her—an invisible weight pressed down on her heart.

Hours passed, and Nathaniel never left. "If you need anything, just say the word," he murmured, his voice low.

She wanted to tell him to go. That she didn’t need his pity.

But the words died on her tongue. Instead, she simply nodded again.

After a quick shower, she found him on a tense phone call, his jaw clenched, his tone sharp.

When he hung up, he placed a glass of warm water beside her and said gently, "There’s an issue with the new media division. I need to handle it, but I won’t be long. Rest if you’re tired."

"Alright," she murmured.

As he settled onto the sofa, his laptop open, she couldn’t help but notice the exhaustion lining his face.

After a moment’s hesitation, she spoke up. "Nathaniel, is everything alright?"

He glanced up, surprised. "Just complications with the new project. Nothing I can’t handle."

She didn’t doubt that.

Still, she suggested, "You should go home. The doctor said I’m fine. You won’t get proper rest here."

His gaze darkened. "Do you really think I’d leave you alone?"

"I’m not an invalid," she countered. "I can take care of myself."

"You’re not just taking care of yourself anymore," he said firmly. "If it makes you feel better, think of it as me staying for the baby."

But they both knew that wasn’t the real reason.

Evelyn frowned, unable to decipher his stubborn insistence.

###Chapter 249

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn’s office, illuminating the architectural blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the design—a new luxury resort project Nathaniel had entrusted to her firm.

A knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Evelyn?" Gregory Wilson, her business partner, leaned against the doorframe, his expression unreadable. "You have a visitor."

Before she could respond, Isabella Davis strode into the room, her designer heels clicking sharply against the polished floor. The air grew thick with tension.

"Long time no see, Evelyn," Isabella said, her voice dripping with false sweetness.

Evelyn straightened, her grip tightening on her pen. "What do you want, Isabella?"

Isabella smirked, tossing her glossy hair over one shoulder. "Just thought I’d drop by and congratulate you. Landing the Martin Group’s resort project—quite the achievement."

Evelyn’s jaw clenched. She knew this wasn’t a social call. "If you’re here to stir trouble, save it. I don’t have time for games."

Isabella’s smile faltered, replaced by a cold glint in her eyes. "Oh, but this isn’t a game. It’s a warning." She stepped closer, lowering her voice. "Nathaniel might be yours now, but things change. And when they do, I’ll be right there to pick up the pieces."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened, but she refused to back down. "Is that a threat?"

Isabella laughed lightly. "Call it whatever you want." She turned on her heel, pausing at the door. "By the way, I heard about your little… mishap at the gala last week. Such a shame. Almost like someone wanted to embarrass you."

The door clicked shut behind her, leaving Evelyn frozen in place.

Gregory exhaled sharply. "What was that about?"

Evelyn’s mind raced. The gala incident—her dress tearing unexpectedly—had seemed like an accident. But now…

"Nothing," she lied, forcing a calm she didn’t feel. "Just Isabella being Isabella."

But as she turned back to her blueprints, her hands trembled.

Something wasn’t right.

And she had a sinking feeling this was only the beginning.

The quiet hum of the laptop filled the room as Nathaniel worked, his fingers flying across the keyboard. Evelyn had been silent for hours, her presence a soft shadow beside him.

By eleven, exhaustion finally pulled her under. She drifted off to sleep, the faint glow of the TV casting flickering light across her face.

When Nathaniel finished his work, he washed up quickly before returning to the bed. His gaze lingered on Evelyn, her breathing slow and steady. For a moment, he hesitated—then, with careful precision, he lifted the covers and slid in beside her, drawing her gently into his arms.

It had been too long since he’d held her like this. Every touch, every embrace lately had been met with resistance, a wall between them he couldn’t seem to breach.

But now, in the quiet of the night, he let himself savor the warmth of her against him. His hand drifted to her stomach, resting lightly over the life growing inside her.

He hadn’t noticed before. Hadn’t let himself think about it.

A faint, rueful smile touched his lips as he tightened his hold, pressing a kiss to her hair before sleep finally took him too.

Morning came with a soft knock at the door. Nathaniel stirred, blinking awake before glancing down at Evelyn, still asleep in his arms. Reluctantly, he slipped out of bed and opened the door.

Thomas and Charlotte stood there, eyebrows lifting at his disheveled appearance.

"You stayed here all night?" Thomas asked.

"Don’t wake her," Nathaniel said, voice low.

Charlotte peered past him. "Is Evelyn still asleep?"

"Yes."

"You should wake her," Charlotte murmured. "Too much sleep will just give her a headache."

Nathaniel didn’t budge.

The air between them grew thick, tense.

Neither Thomas nor Charlotte moved to leave.

A silent standoff stretched between them—until Evelyn’s voice drifted from the bed.

"Charlotte?"

Charlotte brightened instantly. "It’s me."

"Come in."

"I just got here," Charlotte said smoothly. "Thought you were still asleep."

Nathaniel stepped aside, jaw tight, as Charlotte slipped past him.

The moment she entered, the tension in the room eased.

Evelyn watched as Thomas followed Charlotte inside, questions flickering in her eyes—but she didn’t voice them.

Nathaniel left to freshen up when Samuel arrived with breakfast. "Eat first," he told Evelyn. "The doctor will check on you before discharge."

She nodded, picking at her food.

As Nathaniel and Thomas stepped out onto the balcony, Evelyn turned to Charlotte.

"Why did you come with him?"

Charlotte smirked. "Would you believe me if I said he spent the whole night outside your apartment?"

"You didn’t let him in?"

"Of course not."

"Good," Evelyn said, taking a slow bite.

Charlotte studied her, eyes bright with amusement. "Nathaniel knows about the baby now. And he was genuinely worried when you fainted. It didn’t seem like an act. Are you still set on ending things?"

Evelyn met her gaze, chewing thoughtfully before answering.

"Do you really think a child can fix a marriage with no love?"



###Chapter 250

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort that could redefine Martin Group's portfolio.

A knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, glancing up as Gabrielle, her assistant, stepped inside.

"You have a meeting with Mr. Wilson in fifteen minutes," Gabrielle reminded her, placing a fresh cup of coffee on the desk. "And Mr. Martin called earlier. He asked if you'd join him for dinner tonight."

Evelyn's lips curved into a small smile. Nathaniel had been unusually attentive lately, ever since their argument about Isabella's sudden reappearance. She still wasn't sure how she felt about it—his ex-fiancée showing up after all these years, claiming she only wanted closure.

"Tell him I'll be there," she said, taking a sip of coffee.

Gabrielle hesitated. "Also... Ms. Davis left another message. She insists on speaking with you."

Evelyn's grip tightened around the mug. Isabella had been relentless, calling and texting, even showing up at the office once. Nathaniel had assured her it was nothing, but the woman's persistence was unsettling.

"Block her number," Evelyn said coolly. "If she shows up again, have security escort her out."

Gabrielle nodded and left, closing the door softly behind her.

Evelyn exhaled, rubbing her temples. She needed to focus. The meeting with Gregory was important—they were finalizing the resort's design before presenting it to the board. But Isabella's shadow loomed over her thoughts, a ghost from Nathaniel's past that refused to stay buried.

Her phone buzzed. A text from Nathaniel:

Looking forward to tonight. I have something to tell you.

Her heart skipped. Was this about Isabella? Or something else entirely?

She typed back: Can't wait. I have news too.

Because she did. News that could change everything.

But first, she had a meeting to win.

Charlotte's eyebrows knitted together as she studied Evelyn's face. "You're really keeping it?"

"This baby is mine," Evelyn declared, her voice steeled with conviction. "No one will take that from me—not even Nathaniel."

Charlotte's breath hitched at the raw determination in her best friend's words.

Unaware of Charlotte's reaction, Evelyn continued, her tone measured. "He doesn't love me. A child won't change that. Even if he suddenly starts acting tender, it won’t be for me—it’ll be for the baby. I’m not naive enough to confuse obligation with love."

"I spent a year trying to make him love me. It didn’t work. This marriage was doomed from the start."

The clarity in Evelyn’s reasoning struck Charlotte like a splash of cold water, sharpening her own thoughts.

A slow, approving smile curved Charlotte’s lips. "Good. You’re still the same Evelyn I know—too proud to settle for scraps of affection."

Evelyn let out a dry chuckle. "I wasted twelve months chasing Nathaniel’s love. If you’re mocking me, just say it outright."

Her refusal to beg for Nathaniel’s love didn’t mean she couldn’t cherish this child.

To her, those were two entirely separate things.

After breakfast, the doctor performed a color ultrasound, confirming both Evelyn’s health and the baby’s steady heartbeat.

When Nathaniel saw the tiny flicker of life on the screen, his expression softened in a way Evelyn had never witnessed before.

He really does care about the baby.

An unexpected pang of uncertainty twisted in her chest.

Once discharged, they stepped outside to find Samuel waiting with the car. Nathaniel motioned for Evelyn to enter, then turned to Charlotte. "Coming with us, or do you have other plans?"

Charlotte hesitated. "You go ahead. I’ll catch up in thirty minutes."

"Fine." Evelyn didn’t press further, though she did shoot Thomas a brief glance before sliding into the backseat.

Nathaniel and Thomas exchanged a silent look before joining her.

As the car pulled away from the hospital, Nathaniel broke the quiet. "Don’t worry about Charlotte. Thomas knows he messed up. He won’t cross that line again."

Evelyn kept her gaze fixed on the passing buildings. "I’m not worried."

The air grew thick with tension. Samuel, sensing the frosty silence, cleared his throat. "Should we head straight to the estate?"

"Take me to my apartment first," Evelyn said firmly. "My grandmother must be frantic by now."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened, but Evelyn refused to meet his eyes, her attention locked on the window.

She didn’t bother sugarcoating it—she had no intention of moving back in with him.

His voice was low, edged with frustration. "Do as she says."

Samuel nodded, and silence reclaimed the car, heavy and suffocating.

When they arrived at her building, Evelyn pushed the door open before anyone could assist her. She turned to Nathaniel with a polite but distant smile. "I’ll go up alone. You should head to the office."

Nathaniel’s frown deepened. "Are you pushing me away again?"

Evelyn blinked, caught off guard.

"I just don’t need you hovering over me," she said evenly. "I’m four months pregnant, not an invalid. I can take care of myself. This baby doesn’t mean I’ll stop living my life—as long as I’m not endangering it, I intend to carry on as usual."



###Chapter 251

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. Evelyn stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

She sighed, rolling onto her back. The silk sheets felt cool against her skin, a stark contrast to the warmth she craved. His absence was becoming more frequent lately, and though he always had excuses—meetings, emergencies, last-minute deals—she couldn’t shake the unease settling in her chest.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory: "Meeting at 10. Don’t be late."

Evelyn groaned. She had completely forgotten about the client presentation. Throwing off the covers, she hurried to the ensuite bathroom, splashing cold water on her face. The reflection staring back at her was tired, shadows faintly lining her eyes.

When was the last time I slept properly?

She dressed quickly—a tailored navy pantsuit, her signature look—and grabbed her portfolio before heading out. The penthouse elevator descended smoothly, but her thoughts were anything but steady.

The lobby was bustling when she stepped out. A familiar voice called her name.

"Evelyn!"

She turned to see Caroline waving from across the room, her white coat fluttering as she jogged over. "You look like you’ve seen a ghost. Rough night?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Just work."

Caroline studied her for a moment before sighing. "You’re lying. But fine, I won’t pry." She linked arms with Evelyn. "Come on, I’ll walk you out. You need coffee."

The café down the street was their usual spot. The rich aroma of espresso wrapped around them as they stepped inside. Caroline ordered for them both—black for Evelyn, caramel latte for herself—before steering them to a corner table.

"So," Caroline said, stirring her drink. "When are you going to tell me what’s really going on?"

Evelyn hesitated. She wanted to confide in her cousin, but voicing her fears made them real. "It’s Nathaniel. He’s been… distant."

Caroline’s brows furrowed. "How distant?"

"Late nights. Cancelled dinners. He barely looks at me anymore." Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her cup. "And then there’s her."

Isabella Davis. The name alone was enough to sour her mood. Nathaniel’s ex, the woman who still held a piece of his heart, if the tabloids were to be believed.

Caroline’s expression darkened. "You think he’s seeing her again?"

"I don’t know." Evelyn exhaled sharply. "But I’m not going to sit around and wonder."

She pulled out her phone, scrolling to a message she’d received last night—an anonymous tip about Nathaniel being spotted at a high-end hotel downtown. The same one Isabella was rumored to be staying at.

Caroline’s eyes widened. "You’re not seriously considering—"

"I need to know the truth." Evelyn’s voice was steel. "Even if it destroys me."

The café door chimed. Both women turned as Samuel Yates, Nathaniel’s secretary, walked in. His gaze locked onto Evelyn, and for a split second, panic flickered across his face before he schooled his features.

"Mrs. Martin," he said smoothly. "What a coincidence."

Evelyn’s smile didn’t reach her eyes. "Is it?"

Samuel cleared his throat. "Mr. Martin asked me to pick up his usual order." He gestured to the counter.

"Of course." Evelyn leaned back, watching him. "Tell me, Samuel, does my husband often send you out for coffee?"

"Only when he’s too busy to step out himself."

"How dedicated of you."

Samuel shifted uncomfortably before nodding and walking away. Caroline whistled low under her breath.

"Well, that was tense."

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms. "He’s hiding something."

Caroline sighed. "What are you going to do?"

Evelyn checked her watch. The meeting with Gregory was in twenty minutes. But suddenly, that didn’t seem as important.

"First, I’m going to that hotel." She stood, determination hardening her resolve. "And then? We’ll see."


Evelyn's words had cut deeper than she intended. Nathaniel had only just discovered her pregnancy—three months too late.

His jaw tightened, shadows flickering across his face. "I'll wait until you're inside," he said, voice low.

She didn't argue. A brief nod, then she turned toward the apartment building without another word.

Inside the car, Nathaniel's tone was clipped. "To the office."

Samuel obeyed, accelerating smoothly.

"When is Grandfather being discharged?" Nathaniel asked.

"Tomorrow morning. Sir Edward is perfectly fine, but Mr. Richard insisted he stay another night for observation."

"Good. Pick him up tomorrow. Then take my mother to Evelyn's place."

A beat of silence. Samuel didn't question the order, though his grip on the wheel tightened slightly. "Understood."

Not long after Nathaniel's departure, Thomas pulled up to the same apartment complex.

Charlotte flashed a practiced smile. "Well, we've cleared the air. Friends now, right?"

The lie hung between them, obvious but unspoken.

Neither believed it.

Thomas merely nodded. "Sure."

She stepped out without hesitation, pausing only to wave. "Bye!"

He watched her in the rearview mirror until she disappeared inside. Only then did he drive away.

Charlotte's smile dissolved the moment the car vanished. Blank-faced, she headed upstairs.

Evelyn had just returned from visiting Beatrice when Charlotte walked in.

Their eyes met. No questions were asked.

"I'm heading back to Dattlech soon," Charlotte said abruptly. "Orders are piling up."

Evelyn smirked. "Thanks for keeping my business afloat. Baby needs designer clothes, after all."

"Don't mention it," Charlotte muttered, voice oddly strained.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Cry if you need to. I won't judge."

"Pass."

"Then stop looking like someone kicked your puppy."

Charlotte didn't answer, just stared out the window, expression unreadable.

They never coddled each other. Space was their version of comfort.

That afternoon, Evelyn returned to work.

Two days of absence hadn't delayed the project, but she refused to make it a habit.

She organized the next set of blueprints, instructing Gabrielle to deliver them to the Martin Group for Nathaniel's approval. Then she drove to the construction site herself.

Daniel gave her a tour. Pride swelled in Evelyn's chest as she surveyed the skeletal high-rise—her design taking tangible form.

But one misstep could unravel everything.

"Are there material backups for quality checks?" she asked sharply.

Daniel nodded. "As you requested. All samples are cataloged."

"Good. Now verify every shipment meets specifications."

"Consider it done." He admired her precision. Young, but ruthlessly thorough.

Dusk had fallen by the time Evelyn left.

Then she froze.

A familiar silhouette leaned against a car in the parking lot.

She approached slowly. "Nathaniel? What are you doing here?"



###Chapter 252

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the penthouse, painting the marble floors in warm hues. Evelyn stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the silk sheets. Beside her, Nathaniel was already awake, his piercing blue eyes studying her with quiet intensity.

"You're staring," she murmured, a playful smile tugging at her lips.

"Can't help it," he replied, his voice rough with sleep. "You're breathtaking."

Evelyn rolled her eyes but couldn't suppress the flutter in her chest. Even after all this time, Nathaniel had a way of making her feel like the only woman in the world.

The moment was shattered by the shrill ring of Nathaniel's phone. He frowned, glancing at the caller ID before answering. "Samuel. What is it?"

Evelyn watched as his expression darkened. Whatever news Samuel Yates was delivering, it wasn't good.

"We'll be there," Nathaniel said curtly before ending the call.

"What happened?" Evelyn asked, sitting up straighter.

"Edward wants to see us. Immediately."

Evelyn's stomach twisted. Edward Martin wasn’t the type to summon them without reason. Something was wrong.

The drive to the Martin estate was tense. Nathaniel gripped the steering wheel, his jaw clenched. Evelyn reached over, placing a reassuring hand on his arm. "Whatever it is, we'll handle it together."

He exhaled sharply but didn't respond.

When they arrived, Winston greeted them at the door, his usual composed demeanor slightly frayed. "Mr. Martin is waiting in the study."

Edward sat behind his imposing oak desk, his expression unreadable. Richard and Victoria stood nearby, their faces grim.

"Grandfather," Nathaniel said, stepping forward. "What's going on?"

Edward's gaze flickered to Evelyn before settling on Nathaniel. "There's been a development regarding the Summit Realty deal."

Evelyn tensed. That project had been a point of contention for weeks.

Sebastian Wilson had been relentless in his attempts to undermine Nathaniel, using every dirty trick in the book. But this—this felt different.

Edward slid a document across the desk. "They've filed a lawsuit. Accusing us of corporate espionage."

Nathaniel's eyes blazed. "That's absurd."

"Is it?" Richard interjected coldly. "Because they claim to have evidence."

Evelyn's mind raced. This wasn't just about business. This was personal. Sebastian had been waiting for an opportunity to strike, and now he had it.

"We need to act fast," she said, her voice steady despite the storm brewing inside her.

Nathaniel nodded, his expression hardening. "We will."

But as Evelyn met Edward's gaze, she saw something that sent a chill down her spine—doubt.

And for the first time, she wondered if they were already too late.

Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn as he stated coolly, "You didn’t pick up, so I came myself."

He had been waiting outside for nearly an hour.

When he learned she was overseeing the construction site, he resisted the urge to barge in, choosing instead to wait patiently in the car. The moment her phone went unanswered, his first thought was that she was upset—perhaps because her assistant had mistakenly sent the draft meant for the Martin Group elsewhere.

Evelyn quickly pulled out her phone, checking the screen. Sure enough, two missed calls from Nathaniel stared back at her.

She bit her lip. "Sorry, it was on silent. I didn’t hear it."

Nathaniel studied her face, searching for any flicker of emotion. Then, without another word, he pushed open the car door. "Get in. Samuel will drive your car back later. Beatrice is expecting us for dinner."

"You went to see her?"

"I did. We talked for a while."

A soft gratitude warmed her voice. "Thank you."

Though the words irked him, Nathaniel didn’t let it show. He simply remained silent as he drove toward the apartment.

Breaking the quiet, he asked, "Why the sudden visit to the site?"

"I wasn’t supervising," Evelyn clarified. "Just checking the progress. Daniel handles everything well—he doesn’t need me hovering."

Nathaniel nodded. "Everything running smoothly?"

"Yes, though I reminded them to be extra cautious with materials and safety, especially on higher floors."

The construction industry was fraught with risks, particularly at this stage. Evelyn had given the same warnings to Daniel earlier.

Time slipped away as they exchanged brief work updates. By the time they arrived at the apartment, neither seemed eager to end the conversation.

Beatrice’s face lit up when they walked in together, though she bit back any obvious remarks, not wanting to embarrass Evelyn.

During dinner, Nathaniel surprised them both by attentively serving Beatrice. Touched, she couldn’t resist saying, "Nathaniel, take good care of Evelyn. She’s carrying your child now."

Evelyn shot her grandmother a warning look, but Beatrice pretended not to notice. Instead, she turned to Nathaniel. "She acts tough, but deep down, she’s sensitive. She’ll say you’ve been perfect, but she might secretly resent you for things. So, pay attention."

"Grandma!"

Evelyn’s brows knitted together in protest.

Beatrice merely chuckled. "See? She hates being called out."

"Enough," Evelyn muttered.

"Fine, I’ll stop."

Nathaniel rarely saw Evelyn so flustered. Amused, he tilted his head. "Is everything she said true?"

Evelyn glared at him, her eyes flashing with irritation and warning.

Nathaniel smirked, finding her reaction unexpectedly entertaining.

Despite her annoyance, the tension between them eased. Leaning closer, he murmured, "Even if it is, I don’t care. It’s part of what makes you, you."

Evelyn stiffened, pressing her lips together.

His words lingered in her mind.

He doesn’t care because he doesn’t love me.

He says it’s good—but what’s so good about it?

If she had a choice, she wouldn’t want to be this way. Living like this was exhausting.

After dinner, they offered to stay and chat, but Beatrice shooed them away. "Nathaniel, take Evelyn for a walk. She needs the exercise."



###Chapter 253

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew over the blueprints, making precise adjustments with her mechanical pencil. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint aroma of ink from the printer.

Gabrielle knocked lightly before entering, balancing a stack of files in one arm. "The contractors for the Riverside project just called. They need your approval on the final materials list by noon."

Evelyn glanced at her watch, then at the half-empty coffee cup. "Tell them I'll review it within the hour." She rubbed her temples, feeling the beginnings of a tension headache. The Martin Group gala tonight loomed large in her mind - her first public appearance as Nathaniel's wife since their whirlwind wedding.

Her phone buzzed with a text from Nathaniel: Running late. Board meeting ran over. Will meet you at the penthouse by 6. She typed a quick reply, her lips curving unconsciously. Even after three months of marriage, just thinking about him sent warmth through her chest.

The intercom crackled. "Ms. Mitchell? Mr. Wilson is here to see you." Evelyn's eyebrows rose. Gregory hadn't mentioned dropping by today.

He strode in moments later, his usual crisp suit slightly rumpled. "We have a problem," he said without preamble, dropping a glossy magazine onto her desk. The headline screamed: Martin Heir's Secret Past: The Truth About Isabella Davis.

Evelyn's breath caught. The accompanying photo showed a younger Nathaniel with his arm around a stunning blonde at some charity event years ago. Isabella's smile was dazzling, her grip on Nathaniel possessive even in the frozen moment.

Gregory tapped the page. "This hit newsstands an hour ago. The article claims they were engaged before she disappeared mysteriously." His voice dropped. "There's speculation about... foul play."

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she flipped through the pages. The article quoted "anonymous sources" suggesting Nathaniel's family had paid Isabella to disappear when she became inconvenient. Worse, it hinted she might have met with an accident.

Her stomach twisted. Nathaniel had mentioned Isabella exactly once - as an ex from college days. Nothing about an engagement. Nothing about... this.

The office phone rang shrilly. Gabrielle's voice came through, strained. "It's Mr. Martin's assistant. Line one."

Evelyn reached for the receiver with numb fingers. Samuel Yates' usually composed voice held an edge. "Mrs. Martin, we have a situation. Reporters are camped outside all Martin Group properties. Mr. Martin suggests you leave the office immediately through the service entrance. A car will meet you at—"

The line went dead as Evelyn's cell phone chimed with an incoming video message. The preview frame showed Isabella's face. Alive. Smiling.

Her thumb hovered over the screen. Every instinct screamed not to open it. But she had to know.

The video played. Isabella, older but still beautiful, sat in what looked like a hotel room. "Hello Evelyn," she purred. "Bet you didn't see this coming. Neither did Nathaniel." She leaned closer to the camera, her blue eyes icy. "I'm coming home. And darling? You might want to check your prenup. There are things about your husband even you don't know."

The screen went black. Evelyn realized she'd stopped breathing.

Gregory's hand on her shoulder startled her. "Evelyn? What is it?"

She turned the phone toward him, her voice barely above a whisper. "She's back."

Outside, the first reporters were already shouting questions through the building's glass doors. Evelyn's perfect world was crumbling, and the storm had only just begun.

Evelyn protested, "Grandma Beatrice, I've been on my feet all afternoon at the construction site. That's more than enough exercise for today. Please don't make me walk anymore."

"If I didn't see it, it doesn't count," Beatrice replied stubbornly.

"Grandma!"

Beatrice ignored her and turned to Nathaniel instead. "Pregnant women can be moody. Be patient with her."

Nathaniel nodded. "Understood."

In the end, the two of them stepped out under Beatrice’s watchful gaze. Evelyn had half a mind to retreat to her apartment, but Nathaniel murmured, "She’s watching us. Let’s just take a short walk downstairs and come back, alright?"

They strolled around the apartment complex in silence for a while before Nathaniel finally spoke. "Has Beatrice always been this... energetic?"

"Yes," Evelyn answered simply.

Her grandmother was the kind of woman who radiated optimism, no matter the circumstances.

Nathaniel’s lips curved slightly. "Good."

Evelyn didn’t understand why he’d asked, but she didn’t press further.

Half an hour later, they returned to the building’s entrance.

Evelyn stopped and turned to him. "I’ll go up alone. You can leave now."

Nathaniel immediately caught the dismissal in her words. His gaze sharpened as he studied her.

They stood there, locked in a silent standoff. His expression was unreadable, but his eyes held something deeper—something questioning.

"Evelyn," he said finally, "are you still upset with me?"

She hesitated, then answered softly, "No. There’s nothing between us to be upset about. Why would you even ask?"

"If that’s true, then why won’t you let me come upstairs?"

"If you come up now, you’ll just have to leave again later. I’m saving you the trouble."

"How thoughtful." His voice was dry. "In that case, have you considered my question?"

Evelyn froze.

His words brought back the memory of him asking—Would you really let us stay divorced?

She pressed her lips together, meeting his gaze steadily. The air between them grew heavy with unspoken tension.

After a long pause, she exhaled. "My answer is—"

A sharp ringtone cut her off.

Nathaniel frowned, pulling out his phone. He glanced at the screen before answering. "What is it?"

"Nathaniel, where are you? Come out for drinks!"

It was Thomas. Evelyn caught fragments of his voice through the phone.

Nathaniel’s eyes flicked back to her. She gave him a small nod. "Go ahead. I’ll head upstairs."

Without waiting for his response, she turned and walked away. Nathaniel watched her retreating figure before lifting the phone again. His voice was ice. "I’ll be there."

Thomas, having overheard Evelyn, hesitated. "Did I just interrupt something?"

"No," Nathaniel said flatly, then hung up before Thomas could say another word.

When Nathaniel arrived at the club, Thomas was already several drinks in.

Spotting him, Thomas raised his glass with a wry grin. "Nathaniel! Finally. Let’s drink until we forget everything tonight!"

Nathaniel gave him an unimpressed look. "Don’t expect me to call Charlotte or drag her here for you."

His blunt refusal was merciless.

Yet Thomas only laughed, though the bitterness in his eyes deepened. "You’re overthinking it. Why would I ask you to involve her? We’ve already agreed—we’re going our separate ways."

"And you’re sure about that?"

"What else is there to think about?" Thomas’s smile stretched wider, but the sorrow in his gaze was unmistakable.



###Chapter 254

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest design—a luxury resort for the Martin Group. The project was her biggest yet, and the pressure weighed heavily on her shoulders.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Evelyn?" Gabrielle poked her head in, holding a steaming cup of coffee. "Thought you might need this."

Evelyn smiled gratefully. "You're a lifesaver."

Gabrielle hesitated before speaking again. "Nathaniel called earlier. He said he’d be late for dinner tonight—another emergency meeting."

Evelyn’s grip tightened around the mug. Lately, Nathaniel had been distant, buried under the weight of his family’s empire. She understood, but the loneliness still stung.

"Is everything okay?" Gabrielle asked gently.

Evelyn forced a smile. "Just work stress. Nothing I can’t handle."

But as Gabrielle left, Evelyn’s gaze drifted to her phone. No messages. No calls. Just silence.

Meanwhile, across town, Nathaniel sat in his father’s office, listening to Richard Martin’s latest demands.

"You need to finalize the merger with Summit Realty by the end of the week," Richard said, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Nathaniel clenched his jaw. "I’ll handle it."

Richard’s eyes narrowed. "See that you do. The board expects results, not excuses."

As Nathaniel left the office, Samuel Yates fell into step beside him. "Sir, Isabella Davis is waiting in the lobby. She says it’s urgent."

Nathaniel froze. Isabella—his past, a ghost he thought he’d buried.

"What does she want?"

Samuel shook his head. "She wouldn’t say. Only that it concerns Evelyn."

A cold dread settled in Nathaniel’s chest. Whatever Isabella wanted, it couldn’t be good.

Back at the office, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. An unknown number.

Meet me at Café Blanc. We need to talk.

The message sent a shiver down her spine. Something was coming—something that would change everything.

Thomas stepped out of the club with Nathaniel. At the entrance, they ran into Penelope, who had just arrived.

Penelope immediately rushed to Thomas's side, looping her arm through his. "Thomas, you're drunk. Let me take you home."

Then she turned to Nathaniel. Despite Evelyn having taught her a lesson, Nathaniel's influence was undeniable. She forced a polite smile. "Good evening, Nathaniel. It's late. Would you like me to arrange a driver for you?"

"No need." Nathaniel hadn't been drinking. He gave Thomas a brief glance. "I'm leaving."

Thomas shook Penelope off and quickly caught up with him. "I'm staying at your place tonight."

Left standing alone, Penelope bit her lip, frustration flashing in her eyes. "Thomas, I came all this way to pick you up. If the press catches you like this, your grandfather will hear about it by morning."

"Are you threatening me with Grandfather?" Though intoxicated, Thomas's mind was sharp. His cold stare pinned her in place. "Don't think I don't know what you've been up to. This is your last warning. If you ever interfere with her again, we're done."

The severity of his words stunned Penelope into silence.

She didn't dare argue further, watching helplessly as Thomas walked away. Finally, she climbed into her car and left, her expression darkening with resentment.

The next morning, Edward was discharged from the hospital.

Samuel drove Edward back to the Martin estate before promptly taking Victoria to Evelyn's office.

Samuel relayed Nathaniel's exact words to Victoria, who raised an eyebrow. "What is Nathaniel playing at? Does he expect me to convince Evelyn for him?"

"Mrs. Victoria Martin, I wouldn't presume to interpret Mr. Martin's intentions. Perhaps he's simply concerned about Mrs. Martin's well-being, given her pregnancy, and thought your presence might reassure her."

Victoria chuckled. "How diplomatic. You should teach Nathaniel a thing or two about sweet-talking. Otherwise, by the time my grandchild arrives, he'll be the one sleeping on the couch."

Samuel suppressed a smile, wisely choosing not to respond.

After dropping Victoria off at Evelyn's company, Samuel left. Victoria took the elevator up alone, familiar with the route from her previous visit.

She had thoughtfully brought coffee from the café downstairs—a morning pick-me-up for the team.

Gabrielle was the first to spot her. She greeted Victoria warmly before escorting her to Evelyn's office.

Evelyn wasn't surprised to see Victoria. While Edward had known about her pregnancy for a while, Victoria and Richard had only recently found out.

The two women exchanged knowing smiles.

Gabrielle discreetly excused herself, closing the door behind her.

Evelyn gestured to the sofa. "Victoria, what brings you here? Have you eaten? Is Edward settled at home?"

"Yes, he's fine. I came straight here after getting him settled." Victoria sat beside her, lowering her voice. "How are you feeling? Everything alright with the baby?"

Evelyn nodded. "We're both doing well."

"Good." Victoria patted her hand. "Pregnancy is exhausting. You should cut back on work and take it easy. Understand?"

"Of course. Anything you say."

"You'll really listen to me?" A mischievous glint appeared in Victoria's eyes.

Evelyn laughed. "Yes. I wouldn't lie to you."

"Perfect. Then move back to the estate. Let me take care of you. Your diet needs to be balanced now, and I won't have you living alone while pregnant. Come home, alright?"

Evelyn blinked, caught off guard.

She hadn't expected this.

Before she could respond, Victoria pressed on. "No arguments. You promised to listen to me."

Evelyn sighed in amusement. "Victoria, I thought you just wanted me to reduce my workload. I didn’t realize you were plotting to bring me back."
###Chapter 255

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort in the Maldives. The design was ambitious, but she thrived on challenges.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Ms. Mitchell, Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn straightened, smoothing the creases from her blouse. "Send him in."

Gregory Wilson strode in, his usual confident demeanor slightly frayed at the edges. "We have a problem," he said without preamble, dropping a folder onto her desk.

She flipped it open, scanning the contents. A frown creased her brow. "The zoning permits were denied?"

"Not just denied," Gregory sighed, running a hand through his hair. "The city council is pushing for a complete redesign. They claim our current plan doesn’t align with their environmental regulations."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. This was the third setback this month. "We can’t afford any more delays. The investors are already restless."

Gregory leaned against the desk, crossing his arms. "I’ve scheduled a meeting with the council tomorrow. We’ll need to present a revised proposal."

She nodded, already mentally rearranging her schedule. "I’ll pull an all-nighter if I have to. We need this project to stay on track."

Just as Gregory turned to leave, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel flashed on the screen: Dinner tonight? I have something important to discuss.

Her heart skipped a beat. Important discussions with Nathaniel rarely meant good news these days.

Gregory noticed her hesitation. "Everything alright?"

She forced a smile. "Fine. Just family stuff."

He gave her a knowing look but didn’t press further. "Don’t work too late."

Once alone, Evelyn stared at the message, her fingers hovering over the screen. She typed a quick reply: Sure. 8 PM at the usual place?

Nathaniel’s response was immediate: Perfect.

She set the phone aside, trying to ignore the knot forming in her stomach. Whatever he wanted to talk about, she had a sinking feeling it involved her—Isabella Davis, the woman who had once held Nathaniel’s heart and now seemed determined to reclaim it.

Evelyn clenched her fists. She wouldn’t let Isabella—or anyone—destroy what she and Nathaniel had built.

But first, she had a resort to save.

Grabbing her coffee, she dove back into the blueprints, determination burning in her chest.

The battle lines were drawn. And Evelyn Mitchell never backed down from a fight.

"So, you're telling me you don't want to move into the Martin Estate and live with us? Edward would be overjoyed if you came back."

"Victoria, it's not that simple."

"Then it's decided."

Victoria clapped her hands together, her tone final.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. After a long pause, she said, "I need to talk to Nathaniel about this first."

"Why? He’s practically begging for you to return!" Victoria huffed.

Evelyn blinked. "What?"

"I said, you don’t need his permission. You’re the one carrying his child—you call the shots."

Victoria had always been charming, which was why she and Richard remained as close as they had been in their youth.

Evelyn couldn’t help but smile, though she didn’t agree outright. "Victoria, I want to discuss it with Nathaniel because our routines are different from yours and Richard’s. I don’t want to disrupt your household. Habits don’t change just because I’m pregnant. What do you think?"

Victoria didn’t push further. She knew when to back off.

With a nod, she agreed to let Evelyn consult Nathaniel before making a decision.

Then, smoothly shifting topics, they spent the next two hours chatting about pregnancy experiences, losing track of time entirely. By the time Victoria left the office, the sun was already dipping low.

Evelyn called Nathaniel immediately, relaying the conversation. His response was immediate. "You don’t want to move back to the estate?"

"Wouldn’t it be complicated?"

"Fine. What about Pineview Villa? That way, Mom and Grandpa won’t worry, and you’ll have your space."

Evelyn’s expression flattened.

She didn’t answer.

Nathaniel exhaled. "Evelyn, I promise you—nothing will happen without your consent. I won’t cross that line, alright?"

She remained silent. Of course, she didn’t want him touching her.

If she had wanted that, she would’ve agreed yesterday when Samuel brought it up. But moving back wasn’t just about convenience. If things went south later and she wanted to leave, she’d look like the unreasonable one.

Evelyn was comfortable on her own. She didn’t want that to change.

"Nathaniel, your idea isn’t what I want. So, no."

Her refusal was firm.

Nathaniel went quiet.

But Evelyn didn’t soften.

A beat later, his voice turned low. "You really don’t want to move, do you?"

She swallowed. "No."

Nathaniel chuckled darkly. Frustration simmered beneath his tone, but he didn’t argue. Instead, after a tense silence, he said, "Fine. If you won’t come to the estate or Pineview, then I’m moving into your apartment."

"Nathaniel—"

"Enough. This is my compromise. Evelyn, I’ve given you enough space—so much that I didn’t even know you were pregnant for nearly four months."

His tone left no room for negotiation.

Evelyn relented.

She assumed he’d move in a few days later. But by evening, Nathaniel had already sent over his clothes and essentials.

Charlotte, who was supposed to fly back to Dattlech that night, raised an amused brow. "Wow, Evelyn. New roommate already?"

She hadn’t even left yet, and Nathaniel was moving in.

Evelyn rolled her eyes but said nothing.

Charlotte leaned in, whispering, "So… is this him trying to win you back?"

###Chapter 256

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of our penthouse, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. I stretched beneath the silk sheets, my fingers brushing against Nathaniel's bare chest. His steady breathing told me he was still asleep, his dark lashes casting shadows on his chiseled cheekbones.

My phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand. I reached for it, careful not to disturb Nathaniel. The screen displayed an urgent message from Gregory: "Emergency meeting at the firm. 9 AM sharp. Bring your designs for the waterfront project."

I sighed, running a hand through my tangled hair. The Martin Group's latest development was our most ambitious yet - a luxury residential complex along the Hudson River. Nathaniel had personally requested my firm's involvement, though neither of us had anticipated the complications Isabella Davis would bring to the project.

Sliding out of bed, I padded barefoot to the walk-in closet. My reflection in the full-length mirror showed faint shadows under my eyes - the toll of late-night revisions to accommodate Isabella's constant "suggestions." The woman had somehow secured a consulting role on the project, and her presence was like a persistent splinter under my skin.

The shower's steaming water did little to ease the tension in my shoulders. As I dressed in a tailored navy pantsuit, my mind raced through the presentation points. The revised blueprints were good - possibly our best work yet - but I knew Isabella would find some way to criticize them.

Alfred, our butler, had coffee waiting when I entered the kitchen. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin. Mr. Martin left instructions to wake him at eight."

"Thank you, Alfred." I accepted the porcelain cup, savoring the rich aroma. "Please tell him I had to leave early for a meeting."

The city streets were already bustling when my driver pulled up to Mitchell & Wilson Architects. The sleek glass tower reflected the morning light, a stark contrast to the anxiety coiling in my stomach. The elevator ride to the 42nd floor felt interminable.

Gregory met me at the conference room door, his usually cheerful face drawn tight. "They moved up the client presentation. Isabella's already inside with the Martin Group team."

I squared my shoulders. "Then let's not keep them waiting."

The room fell silent as we entered. Isabella sat at the head of the table, her perfect blonde waves cascading over one shoulder. She wore a cream-colored dress that probably cost more than my monthly salary, her crimson lips curved in a knowing smile.

"Evelyn, darling," she purred. "So glad you could join us. We were just discussing how... conventional your initial designs were."

My grip tightened on my portfolio case. Across the table, Samuel Yates - Nathaniel's ever-efficient secretary - gave me an almost imperceptible nod of encouragement.

I set my materials on the table with deliberate calm. "How fortunate that we've made significant revisions then." Opening the portfolio, I revealed the new renderings. "As you'll see, we've incorporated the historical elements you requested while maintaining the modern aesthetic the Martin Group is known for."

Isabella's manicured finger tapped against her chin as she examined the drawings. "Interesting," she murmured, though her tone suggested otherwise. "But don't you think the west facade lacks... drama?"

Before I could respond, the conference room door swung open. Nathaniel stood in the doorway, his charcoal suit impeccably tailored, his expression unreadable. "Am I interrupting?"

The air in the room shifted palpably. Isabella's posture straightened, her smile turning saccharine. "Nathaniel! We didn't expect you until this afternoon."

His gaze swept the room before settling on me. "My schedule changed." He moved to stand beside my chair, his hand briefly brushing my shoulder. "Please, continue with your presentation, Evelyn."

As I began explaining the design concepts, I caught the way Isabella's fingers clenched around her pen. Nathaniel's presence beside me was both comforting and unnerving - a reminder that no matter how professional we tried to be, our personal and professional lives were irrevocably intertwined.

When I finished, the room erupted in applause - everyone except Isabella, who was studying Nathaniel with an intensity that made my skin prickle. Samuel leaned forward. "These are exceptional, Mrs. Martin. Exactly what we've been looking for."

Nathaniel nodded his agreement, but before he could speak, Isabella interjected, "They're adequate, certainly. But I wonder if we shouldn't consider other firms for comparison? Competition always brings out the best in people, don't you think?"

The challenge hung in the air between us. Nathaniel's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. I met Isabella's gaze evenly. "If the Martin Group feels another firm could better meet your needs, we'd certainly understand."

A slow smile spread across Nathaniel's face as he addressed the room. "That won't be necessary. Mitchell & Wilson's vision aligns perfectly with ours." His hand found mine beneath the table, his fingers intertwining with mine. "In fact, I'd like to discuss expanding their role on the project."

Isabella's perfect facade cracked just enough for me to see the fury beneath. As the meeting adjourned, she leaned close, her whisper like venom in my ear. "This isn't over, Evelyn. He was mine first."

I turned to face her fully, my voice low but firm. "And yet he chose me. Repeatedly."

Nathaniel's arm slid around my waist as we exited, his touch both a shield and a promise. But as we stepped into the elevator, my phone buzzed with an unknown number. The message contained just three words that turned my blood to ice:

"Ask him about Paris."

"Did he say anything to you?" Evelyn asked, her fingers nervously twisting the edge of her sweater.

Charlotte shook her head. "No, but he didn’t have to. His actions made everything clear. Evelyn, you’re in his sights now. There’s no escaping it."

Evelyn rolled her eyes, though her stomach tightened. "You can leave now."

Charlotte pouted dramatically. "Not even going to ask me to stay?"

"If I did, would you?"

"Nope."

"Then why bother?"

Their banter was familiar—a cycle of teasing and reconciliation that never lasted long.

Later, Evelyn walked Charlotte downstairs, where a car was already waiting. Because of her pregnancy, Charlotte refused to let her come to the airport.

"Gabrielle will take you," Evelyn insisted. "I won’t relax otherwise."

At the car door, they exchanged quick hugs. "Text me when you land," Evelyn said.

"Of course. And take care of yourself—and my future godchild." Charlotte winked before slipping into the car.

Evelyn watched the car disappear down the street, then noticed the sleek black Mercedes parked across the road. Through the tinted window, Nathaniel sat motionless, his gaze fixed on her.

She looked away and headed back inside.

Still unsettled by Nathaniel’s recent behavior, she turned to him later and said, "Can you talk to Thomas? Tell him to stop with the childish stunts."

Nathaniel didn’t even glance up from his book. "He won’t. He and Charlotte already settled things."

"You trust him that much?" Evelyn muttered before retreating to Beatrice’s apartment.

Lately, being around Nathaniel felt like standing on opposite sides of an invisible wall. Even when they were in the same room, the distance between them stretched endlessly.

Curled up on Beatrice’s couch, Evelyn stared blankly at the wall. Beatrice eyed her for a long moment before finally asking, "Are you here to keep me company, or just to brood?"

Evelyn sighed. "Both, I guess."

"That’s a terrible excuse."

"Grandma!"

Beatrice stood, smoothing her skirt. "It’s late. You should go back."

"Are you kicking me out?"

"If that’s how you want to see it."

Evelyn hesitated, then whispered, "Do you like Nathaniel?"

Beatrice arched a brow. "What’s your point?"

"If you don’t, why do you always defend him?"

Instead of answering, Beatrice asked, "Should I call Nathaniel to come get you?"

Evelyn’s frown deepened, but Beatrice didn’t relent. With no other choice, Evelyn dragged herself back to her own apartment.

Nathaniel was already there, freshly showered and reading on the couch. The moment she stepped in, he set the book aside. "Go shower. Then I’ll go over some pregnancy notes with you."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Since when are you an expert?"

He held up the book—Essential Guide to Pregnancy. "I’ve been studying. Pretty sure I know more than you do right now."

Something warm and unnameable fluttered in her chest, but she bit back the words and headed to the bathroom without another glance.

Twenty minutes later, she emerged to find Nathaniel waiting on the bed. His usual sharp demeanor had softened into something quieter, more intimate. The sight of him like this—relaxed, almost vulnerable—made her pause in the doorway.

He looked up. "Why are you just standing there?"

"Aren’t you going to lecture me?" she challenged, though her voice lacked its usual edge.

Dressed in soft white pajamas, her damp hair curling at her shoulders, she looked younger somehow. The pregnancy had softened her features, smoothing the sharpness that usually guarded her expressions.

Nathaniel’s gaze darkened as it traced her face. Finally, he patted the space beside him. "Sit down first."
###Chapter 257

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Pineview Villa, casting golden patterns across the marble floors. Evelyn stood by the window, her fingers tracing the rim of her coffee cup absentmindedly. The events of last night still weighed heavily on her mind—Nathaniel's unexpected confession, Isabella's sudden reappearance, and that cryptic message from Vanessa.

Her phone buzzed on the countertop. A text from Gregory: "Meeting moved to 11. Client wants revisions on the waterfront project." She sighed. Work never stopped, even when her personal life was unraveling.

Downstairs, Alfred was setting the breakfast table with his usual precision. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted, his voice smooth as aged whiskey. "Mr. Martin has already left for the office. He asked me to inform you that he'll be home late tonight."

Evelyn nodded, though a flicker of irritation passed through her. Late again. Ever since Isabella had slithered back into their lives, Nathaniel had become increasingly distant. She stabbed a piece of melon with her fork a little too forcefully.

The doorbell rang. Alfred moved to answer it, returning moments later with a sleek black envelope. "For you, madam."

Evelyn frowned. The envelope bore no return address, only her name embossed in silver. Inside was a single ivory card with elegant script: "A reminder of promises made. Sunset Lounge. 8 PM. Come alone."

Her blood ran cold. The handwriting was unmistakable—Isabella's.

Gabrielle chose that moment to burst in, her tablet clutched tightly. "Evelyn! The permits for the Heritage Site were denied again. The board claims the design 'lacks historical sensitivity.'" She air-quoted the last words with a roll of her eyes.

Evelyn forced herself to focus. "Reschedule my afternoon. We're going down there personally." She glanced back at the card, then crumpled it in her fist. Whatever game Isabella was playing, she wouldn't let it interfere with her career. Not again.

As Gabrielle hurried off, Evelyn's phone lit up with a call from an unknown number. She answered warily.

"Did you get my invitation?" Isabella's voice was honey laced with arsenic.

Evelyn's grip tightened. "What do you want?"

A soft laugh. "Just a chat between old friends. Or have you forgotten how we used to share... everything?" The line went dead.

Outside, storm clouds gathered over the city skyline. Evelyn exhaled slowly. The calm before the storm had ended.

Evelyn hesitated for a long moment before finally crossing the room and settling onto the edge of the bed.

The space between her and Nathaniel was minimal, the warmth of the room making their proximity feel almost intimate. She kept her gaze averted, lips pressed together in stubborn silence.

"Evelyn," Nathaniel murmured, his voice low. "Are you afraid of me?"

"No."

"Then why won’t you look at me?"

Her eyes flicked up instinctively, meeting his. His gaze was deep, unreadable—like staring into a storm she couldn’t predict.

"What do you want to say?" she asked, voice steady despite the way her pulse jumped.

Nathaniel exhaled, glancing down before launching into a detailed explanation of prenatal care—things she needed to be mindful of during her pregnancy. Then, without warning, he proposed, "Starting tonight, I’ll read to the baby for thirty minutes every evening. It’s beneficial for development."

Evelyn blinked.

"Shouldn’t storytelling start in the third trimester?"

"The baby can perceive sound now. It’s better to begin early."

His tone left no room for argument. She sighed, relenting.

Nathaniel had no natural talent for storytelling. His rendition of The Wolf and the Rabbit was stiff, almost clinical—like he was reading a legal contract rather than a children’s tale. Evelyn, the unwilling audience, barely lasted five minutes before interrupting.

"Nathaniel, you have zero emotion when you read. I doubt the baby enjoys this."

He fell silent, visibly thrown.

"How should I do it, then?"

She snatched the book from him, flipped to a random page, and began narrating with exaggerated voices and animated expressions. When she finished, she realized Nathaniel was staring at her with an intensity that made her skin prickle.

Flustered, she shoved the book back at him. "I need to use the bathroom."

She barely made it off the bed before his hand closed around her wrist, stopping her.

"Why are you running?" he asked, voice dangerously soft.

"Let go. Why do you always do this?"

Instead of releasing her, he pulled her into his arms.

Evelyn shoved against his chest. "You promised you wouldn’t touch me unless I wanted it."

Nathaniel stilled.

For a heartbeat, he didn’t move—didn’t let go. His expression darkened, but after a tense pause, his grip loosened.

Just then, his phone buzzed on the nightstand.

Evelyn caught the caller ID before he did.

Isabella.

Her lips thinned.

Nathaniel answered, tone clipped. "What is it?"

The next second, Isabella’s frantic sobbing filled the room. "Nathaniel, please—my mother’s in the ER! She’s critical. I can’t do this alone. Please, come to the hospital. I need you!"

Evelyn’s fingers curled into fists.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "I’m not a doctor. If she’s being treated, wait for the professionals to do their job."

"But I’m terrified! Nathaniel, I need you here!"

"I can’t help by standing in a waiting room."

"Then I’ll jump off the hospital roof!" Isabella shrieked.

Nathaniel’s voice turned to ice. "Are you threatening me?"

Evelyn didn’t wait to hear the rest. She strode into the bathroom and turned the faucet on full blast, drowning out the conversation.

The water ran.

So did her patience.
###Chapter 258

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, her breath caught in her throat. The air was thick with tension, the kind that made her skin prickle with unease. Across the room, Nathaniel stood rigid, his jaw clenched, his usually warm eyes now cold as steel.

Isabella was there too, her presence like a shadow lingering where it didn’t belong. She wore a smirk that made Evelyn’s fingers curl into fists.

This wasn’t supposed to happen.

Edward Martin, Nathaniel’s grandfather, sat in his high-backed chair, his expression unreadable. The silence stretched, suffocating.

“Explain yourself,” Edward finally demanded, his voice cutting through the stillness like a blade.

Evelyn swallowed hard. She had rehearsed this moment in her head a hundred times, but now, the words stuck in her throat.

Nathaniel stepped forward, his voice low but firm. “There’s nothing to explain. Evelyn is my wife. That’s all that matters.”

Isabella let out a soft, mocking laugh. “Oh, really? Then why did you keep it a secret?”

Evelyn’s pulse raced. She could feel the weight of every gaze in the room—Victoria’s disapproval, Richard’s calculating stare, even Winston’s quiet observation from the corner.

She took a deep breath. “We didn’t want to complicate things.”

“Complicate?” Isabella arched a perfectly sculpted brow. “Or did you just not trust your own family?”

Nathaniel’s hand found Evelyn’s, his grip tight. “Enough.”

But Edward wasn’t finished. His sharp gaze locked onto Evelyn. “You married into this family without so much as a word. Did you think we wouldn’t find out?”

Evelyn lifted her chin. “I didn’t marry for the name. I married for him.”

A flicker of something—surprise?—passed over Edward’s face before it hardened again. “Intentions aside, secrets have consequences.”

The words hung in the air, heavy with warning.

Then, from the doorway, a voice cut in. “And what about your secrets, Grandfather?”

Everyone turned.

Caroline stood there, arms crossed, her expression unreadable.

The room went still.

Edward’s eyes narrowed. “What are you implying?”

Caroline didn’t flinch. “I think you know.”

Evelyn’s breath hitched. What was Caroline doing?

Nathaniel’s grip on her hand tightened.

And then—

The doors burst open.

Samuel Yates rushed in, his face pale. “Sir, we have a problem.”

Edward’s patience snapped. “What now?”

Samuel hesitated, then spoke the words that shattered the fragile tension.

“The media has the story.”

Evelyn’s stomach dropped.

This was worse than she thought.

Outside, the first flashes of cameras lit up the windows.

The game had changed.

And there was no going back.

Isabella's voice trembled as she pleaded, "No, it's not like that. I'm just terrified, Nathaniel. Terrified that something might happen to my mother, and I can't stand the suffocating silence of this hospital. Please... will you come stay with me?"

His response was ice-cold. "If I refuse, will you throw yourself off the roof this time?"

"That's not—"

"Isabella," Nathaniel cut her off, his tone devoid of sympathy. "If you truly want to find a heart donor for your mother quickly, listen carefully. Samuel will go to the hospital. Tell him whatever you need."

The line went dead before she could protest.

Evelyn stepped out of the bathroom moments later, her damp hair clinging to her shoulders. Their eyes met briefly in the dim light before she wordlessly slipped beneath the covers, her back turned to him.

Nathaniel watched her for a long moment before sending Samuel a terse message. Then he settled into bed, the silence between them thick enough to suffocate.

Just as sleep began to claim him, his phone shattered the quiet.

Samuel's voice was tense. "Mr. Martin, Ms. Davis is on the hospital rooftop. She refuses to come down unless you come personally."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Then drag her down."

"She won't let anyone near her, sir."

"So you're telling me I need to teleport there to stop her?" His voice dripped with venom.

Before Samuel could respond, Isabella's shrill voice carried through the receiver. "Tell Nathaniel if he doesn't come, I'll jump! I should've died a year ago—at least then he'd remember me forever!"

Evelyn's voice sliced through the tension. "Go, Nathaniel. You've already ruined my sleep."

The line went abruptly silent as Samuel hung up, realizing Evelyn was in the room.

The bedroom plunged back into stillness. After a weighted pause, Evelyn spoke again, her voice chillingly calm. "You moved in because of the baby. But if you can't handle your mess, leave. I won't tolerate disruptions—especially not from her."

She turned away, signaling the end of the conversation.

Nathaniel lay motionless in the dark, his expression unreadable. Only when Evelyn's breathing evened out did he rise, dressing swiftly before leaving without a sound.

Evelyn wasn't asleep. The moment the door clicked shut, her eyes snapped open, glittering with cold fury.

She exhaled sharply, irritation coiling in her chest. Sleep was impossible now—all thanks to Nathaniel and his theatrics.

By the time Nathaniel arrived at the hospital, Samuel had coaxed Isabella back to her ward with a lie: He's on his way.

Perched on the edge of her bed, Isabella fidgeted impatiently. "Where is he? It's been fifteen minutes!"

Samuel barely masked his annoyance. "Traffic, Ms. Davis."

Her nails dug into the sheets. "Call him. Now."

When he didn't move, she snapped, "Did you hear me?"

Samuel's patience wore thin. "You'll wait, Ms. Davis. Or would you prefer the rooftop again?"



###Chapter 259

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort in the Maldives. The design was ambitious, but she thrived on challenges.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn nodded. "Send him in."

Gregory entered with his usual confident stride, though his expression was unusually tense. "We have a problem," he said without preamble.

She arched a brow. "What kind of problem?"

"The Maldives project. Summit Realty just pulled their funding."

Her stomach dropped. "What? Why?"

Gregory sighed, running a hand through his hair. "Sebastian Wilson claims the design doesn’t align with their vision. He wants a complete overhaul."

Evelyn clenched her jaw. "That’s impossible. We’ve already finalized everything with the contractors."

"I know. But he’s adamant."

She exhaled sharply, frustration bubbling beneath her skin. "Fine. Set up a meeting. I’ll handle this myself."

Gregory hesitated. "There’s more. He mentioned bringing in another architect if we can’t comply."

Her eyes narrowed. "Who?"

"Maxwell. From his in-house team."

Evelyn scoffed. "Of course." She pushed back from her desk, standing abruptly. "Tell Jonathan Blake I want to see the revised contract. And get me everything you can find on Maxwell’s previous work."

Gregory nodded, already pulling out his phone. "I’ll get right on it."

As he left, Evelyn turned to the window, her mind racing. This wasn’t just about the project—it was a power play. And she wasn’t about to back down.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel:

"Dinner tonight? I have something to discuss."

She frowned. His tone was unusually formal. Another problem to deal with.

Typing quickly, she replied:

"Can’t. Work crisis. Rain check?"

His response was immediate.

"It’s important."

Evelyn hesitated. Whatever it was, it could wait. Right now, she had a battle to win.

"I’ll call you later," she sent before tossing her phone onto the couch.

Outside, the city hummed with life, oblivious to the storm brewing in her world. But Evelyn Mitchell never ran from a fight.

And this one was just beginning.

"What gives you the right to speak to me like that?" Isabella's voice dripped with contempt as she jabbed a finger toward Samuel. "You're just Nathaniel's employee. If I tell you to call him, you do it. Don't test me—I can have you fired with a single word. You—"

Her tirade was cut short when the door swung open.

The moment she saw who stood there, her face drained of color. Her accusing hand dropped instantly, and her expression shifted from fury to fragile vulnerability.

"Nathaniel..."

Samuel turned at the sound of the door, his surprise fleeting before he schooled his features into neutrality. "Mr. Martin."

Nathaniel's icy gaze locked onto Isabella. "Your mother is fighting for her life in the ER, and you're threatening suicide to get my attention? Tell me, Isabella—if I hadn’t come, would you have actually jumped? Or did you even stop to think about your mother in all this?"

Isabella’s lips trembled.

She pressed them together, her voice barely above a whisper. "Nathaniel... I wasn’t thinking clearly. I was just so scared. I needed you here. With you beside me, I can face anything."

His expression remained unreadable. "Now that I’m here, what exactly do you expect me to do?"

Isabella studied him, sensing the storm beneath his calm exterior. Had she pushed too far by demanding his presence at this hour?

She hesitated, unsure how to respond.

Nathaniel turned to Samuel. "Any updates on the heart donor search?"

"Still no matches," Samuel replied. "We’ve expanded the search parameters, but nothing yet."

"Keep looking," Nathaniel ordered.

Samuel nodded. "Understood."

Half an hour later, Isabella’s mother was wheeled back into the room.

She was stable—for now. But her condition remained critical, requiring constant monitoring.

The clock read well past two in the morning.

Nathaniel walked to the far end of the corridor, and Isabella trailed after him like a shadow.

"Nathaniel," she began softly, "thank you for coming. And for everything you’ve done for my mother."

He didn’t respond, his silence heavy.

Isabella bit her lip, summoning her courage. "Nathaniel… are you really not going to divorce Evelyn?"

His eyes darkened. "Is this really the time?"

His tone was sharp, his expression unyielding.

She swallowed hard. "I just want the truth. Tell me honestly—are you refusing to end things with her?"

Nathaniel’s face betrayed nothing. No flicker of emotion, no hint of hesitation.

His indifference gnawed at her.

Desperation clawed its way into her voice. "You won’t even give me that much? I’m not asking for anything else—just an answer. If you don’t want the divorce, fine. I’ll walk away. You can fulfill your promises to me in other ways."

Nathaniel finally looked at her, his gaze piercing. "Are you sure that’s what you want?"

###Chapter 260

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort on the coast. The design was ambitious, but she thrived on challenges.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn nodded. "Send him in."

Gregory entered with his usual confident stride, though his expression was unusually tense. "We have a problem," he said without preamble.

She arched a brow. "What kind of problem?"

"The investors are getting cold feet. They're questioning the timeline."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Again? We've gone over this a dozen times. The schedule is tight but manageable."

Gregory ran a hand through his hair. "I know, but they want reassurances. Preferably from someone with more... influence."

Her lips pressed into a thin line. She knew exactly who he was hinting at. "You want me to bring Nathaniel into this?"

"It would help," Gregory admitted. "His name carries weight."

Evelyn hesitated. She hated relying on Nathaniel's connections—it made her feel like she wasn't standing on her own merit. But business was business.

"Fine," she relented. "I'll talk to him tonight."

Just as Gregory turned to leave, her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel lit up the screen:

"Dinner at eight. Wear something nice. I have a surprise for you."

A small smile tugged at her lips despite her earlier irritation. Whatever it was, she couldn't deny the flutter of anticipation in her chest.

But as she set the phone down, another notification popped up—an email from an unknown sender. The subject line alone made her blood run cold:

"You don't belong in his world."

Her fingers trembled as she hovered over the delete button. Was this another one of Isabella's games? Or something worse?

The office suddenly felt suffocating. Evelyn grabbed her coat and headed for the door. She needed air.

And answers.

The city streets were alive with the hum of midday traffic, but Evelyn barely registered the noise. Her mind raced with possibilities. Who would send such a message? And why now?

Her phone rang, startling her. It was Charlotte.

"Hey, are you free for lunch?" her best friend chirped.

Evelyn hesitated. "Actually, I could use the distraction."

"Perfect! Meet me at The Oak in twenty."

Hanging up, Evelyn took a steadying breath. Whatever was coming, she wouldn't face it alone.

But as she hailed a cab, she couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching her.

And they weren't friendly.

Isabella pressed her lips together, the pain in her chest so sharp it stole her breath. She had asked Nathaniel countless times if he truly wanted a divorce.

Yet he had never given her a straight answer.

But now, when she proposed an alternative arrangement—one with conditions—he responded without hesitation.

Does he feel nothing for me anymore? Isabella wondered, her fingers trembling at her sides. Has he been waiting for me to suggest this all along?

She forced herself to remain composed, though her voice wavered slightly. "Yes, I've thought it through. So, Nathaniel… do you agree?"

"What exactly do you want?" His tone was detached, as if discussing a business transaction.

"I want the Martin Group to leverage all its influence to back me—to ensure I win Best Female Singer this year."

Nathaniel studied her, his expression unreadable. "That's it?"

"It's more than enough for me. At least this way, when we part, I'll have a foothold in the industry. I won’t be trampled underfoot."

His gaze turned icy. "Isabella, are you absolutely certain?"

She swallowed hard, forcing a fragile smile. "Yes. I can't force you to stay married to me. I love you, but I don’t want you to be miserable. So… I’ll let you go."

His face remained impassive, unmoved by her words. After a long pause, he said, "Then put it in writing. A contract benefits us both. Agreed?"

Isabella froze.

Her eyes burned as she stared at him. "Nathaniel… you want to sign a contract with me?"

He shrugged. "It’s just a formality. And your terms are reasonable."

Disbelief crashed over her.

When had he changed?

The Nathaniel she knew would have indulged her, would have softened at her tears. Now, he treated her like a stranger.

A terrible thought struck her—did he find out about what happened a year ago?

But no. That was impossible. She had covered her tracks too well.

Unless… Evelyn had gotten to him.

Her nails dug into her palms. After a long silence, she whispered, "Nathaniel, I’m afraid that once we sign this, everything between us will become… transactional. Can you give me time to think?"

She was terrified.

Terrified that once the ink dried, he would vanish from her life completely.

She couldn’t let that happen.

Not when Nathaniel owed her—his guilt over the accident that left her incapacitated for months was the only leverage she had left.

She refused to reduce their relationship to a cold, binding agreement.

Nathaniel seemed unsurprised by her hesitation. He said nothing further, leaving her to her thoughts.

By the time he wrapped up the discussion, it was past three in the morning.

He drove back to the penthouse but didn’t go inside. The last thing he needed was to wake Evelyn. If he disturbed her, she’d likely kick him out without a second thought.

These days, she showed him no mercy.

He finally understood—her earlier kindness had been nothing but an act.

Parking the car, he rolled down the window and lit a cigarette. The rest of the night passed with him slumped in the driver’s seat, lost in thought.

At seven, he bought breakfast and headed upstairs.

He found Beatrice already awake and joined her for the meal. When Evelyn stepped out of the room, he seized the moment.

"Beatrice," he said quietly, "Dr. Theodore won’t be back until next week, so I’ve scheduled your checkup for Monday."

She nodded. "Good. I’ll feel better knowing everything’s in order."

Nathaniel hesitated, then asked, "You still don’t plan to tell her?"
###Chapter 261

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work—again.

She sighed, pushing herself up. The bed felt too large without him.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory.

"Meeting in an hour. Don’t be late."

Evelyn groaned. She had completely forgotten about the client presentation.

Throwing off the covers, she hurried to the bathroom. The mirror reflected her tired eyes, the faint shadows beneath them a testament to restless nights.

"Get it together, Evelyn," she muttered to herself.

Downstairs, Alfred had already prepared breakfast—a perfect spread of fresh fruit, toast, and coffee.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted warmly.

"Morning, Alfred," she replied, grabbing a piece of toast. "Has Nathaniel left already?"

"Indeed. Mr. Martin departed at six. He mentioned an urgent board meeting."

Evelyn nodded, though disappointment settled in her chest.

She took a sip of coffee, the bitterness grounding her.

Her phone buzzed again—Isabella’s name flashing across the screen.

Evelyn’s grip tightened around the cup.

"We need to talk."

The message was simple, yet it sent a chill down her spine.

She exhaled sharply.

"Not today."

But even as she dismissed it, a nagging suspicion lingered.

Isabella never reached out without a reason.

Evelyn set the cup down, her appetite gone.

She had a feeling today was going to be anything but ordinary.

"Yes. I don't want her to worry. At my age, these are just old aches. Nothing life-threatening."

Beatrice's faint smile left Nathaniel speechless. He had always sensed she was keeping something from him, but he couldn’t pinpoint what. So, he let it go.

After breakfast, Evelyn finally woke.

Realizing Nathaniel hadn’t returned all night, an inexplicable heaviness settled in her chest. But she steeled herself—no one was worth this turmoil. She headed straight to Beatrice’s quarters.

Evelyn froze when she spotted Nathaniel there.

Without a word, he pulled out a chair for her, setting a plate down before murmuring, "It was past three when I got back. Didn’t want to disturb you, so I slept in the car."

Her brows knitted. Was this an explanation?

She said nothing, merely meeting his gaze before sitting to eat.

Later, he drove her to work. Just before she exited the car, his voice stopped her. "Don’t send your assistant to Martin Group in your place."

"Why?"

"No particular reason. I’m just not fond of entertaining assistants."

Evelyn’s lips pressed into a thin line. When she glanced at him, his eyes were locked onto hers.

She quickly looked away. "Noted."

As she walked off, neither noticed the sleek black sedan tailing them.

That afternoon, Evelyn took Gabrielle to the construction site.

Her second consecutive visit had Daniel on edge. "Evelyn, does Mr. Martin doubt my competence?"

She shook her head. "This has nothing to do with him. I’m here on my own. You’re doing fine—I just prefer handling certain details myself."

"Phew. Had me worried he was dissatisfied."

"Not at all. Progress looks good."

After their chat, Evelyn headed to inspect materials, instructing Gabrielle to verify steel batch numbers with the supervisor.

Her vigilance stemmed from a gnawing unease—one that had grown sharper by the day.

She stayed until dusk.

Nathaniel called twice. "When are you wrapping up? I’ll come get you."

"Unnecessary. I drove myself," Evelyn replied flatly, eyes scanning a procurement form.

"Positive?"

"Mr. Martin, shall I fetch a rope so you can tether me at home and bar me from working?"

His chuckle was dark. "If you’re offering, I’ll gladly oblige."

She rolled her eyes and hung up.

Work stretched on. Only when darkness swallowed the site did Evelyn set the forms aside. "Gabrielle, let’s go."

Her assistant hesitated. "Actually… someone’s picking me up."

"Need a ride?"

"No, it’s…" Gabrielle’s cheeks pinked. "Not my boyfriend. Not yet, anyway."

Evelyn laughed at her shy grin. "Go on, then. Next time, remind me if I lose track of time."

Gabrielle nodded, darting off to a waiting motorcycle. Watching her cling to the rider, Evelyn felt a pang—she’d never known that kind of youthful abandon.

Smiling wistfully, she turned toward the parking lot.

Never in a million years would she have guessed she’d be abducted there.

###Chapter 262

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew over the blueprints with practiced precision, though her mind kept drifting back to last night's argument with Nathaniel. The tension between them had become palpable, like a storm cloud hovering over their marriage.

Gabrielle knocked lightly before entering, balancing a tray with two steaming cups. "Thought you could use some caffeine," she said, setting down Evelyn's favorite vanilla latte. "You've been here since dawn."

Evelyn sighed, rubbing her temples. "The Kensington project deadline got moved up. Again." She took a grateful sip, the warmth spreading through her chilled fingers. "And Nathaniel..."

Her assistant gave her a knowing look. "Still no resolution about the Paris trip?"

Before Evelyn could respond, her phone buzzed with a text from Isabella. The preview showed only: We need to talk. It's urgent. Her stomach twisted. The last time Nathaniel's ex had reached out, it had nearly destroyed their relationship.

Across town, Nathaniel stood at the floor-to-ceiling windows of Martin Group's executive suite, staring unseeingly at the skyline. Samuel cleared his throat from the doorway. "Sir, the board is waiting for your presentation on the merger."

Nathaniel didn't turn. "Give me five minutes." His phone screen lit up with a notification - security alert from their home system. Evelyn had left their penthouse at 4:37 AM. Again.

At that moment, in a chic uptown café, Isabella nervously twisted her napkin into shreds. Vanessa sat across from her, tapping manicured nails against the table. "You need to tell him today," the agent insisted. "Before the press gets wind of it."

Isabella's gaze flickered to the envelope on the table - the results that could change everything. "What if he doesn't believe me?" she whispered.

Vanessa leaned forward. "The DNA doesn't lie, darling. That child is his."

Back at the office, Evelyn's computer pinged with an email from Sebastian Wilson. The subject line made her blood run cold: Termination of Contract - Effective Immediately. Her hands shook as she clicked open the attached legal notice. Summit Realty was pulling out of their biggest joint venture, citing "breach of confidentiality."

Her phone rang. It was Gregory, his voice uncharacteristically strained. "Evelyn, we have a problem. Someone leaked our proprietary designs to a competitor. The board is calling an emergency meeting."

As Evelyn gathered her things, her gaze fell on the family photo on her desk - she and Nathaniel smiling on their wedding day, back when everything seemed perfect. Now, between the failing projects, the secrets, and Isabella's sudden reappearance, their foundation was crumbling.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel finally entered the boardroom to find not just the directors, but his father Richard waiting with a grim expression. "Son," Richard began, "we need to talk about your wife's company. There are... concerning rumors."

The night air was crisp as Evelyn reached for the car door handle. A shadow moved toward her, and a man's voice cut through the silence.

"Ms. Mitchell, heading back alone this late?"

Evelyn didn't recognize him, but the way he addressed her by name suggested he worked at the site. She offered a polite nod, but before she could respond, rough fabric was yanked over her head, plunging her vision into darkness.

Strong arms hauled her into the vehicle before she could react. The scent of leather and cigarette smoke filled her nose as her wrists were bound to the door handle.

One of the men spoke. "Take her to Mr. Wilson?"

"Obviously. He'll handle the rest."

Mr. Wilson. The name sent a jolt through her. The only Wilson she knew was Sebastian—the man who had been fighting her over the project.

Oddly, the realization steadied her.

She stayed silent, refusing to struggle as the car rumbled to a stop. When they dragged her out, she kept her voice icy.

"Tell Sebastian that if he touches me, the Martins will bury him. But if he lets me go now, I’ll forget this ever happened."

A harsh laugh. "Save your threats for his face."

They marched her into a villa, and the hood was ripped off. Blinding light made her flinch.

Sebastian lounged on a couch, smirking. "Apologies for the dramatic entrance."

The words dripped with false courtesy.

Evelyn met his gaze evenly. "What do you want?"

"You left me no choice. You wouldn’t have come otherwise, would you?"

"Now that I’m here, get to the point."

"The project." He snapped his fingers, and one of his men tossed her bag onto the table. Her phone clattered beside it. "Call Nathaniel. Tell him Summit Realty is joining."

Evelyn didn’t move. "He’ll know something’s wrong if I suddenly bring this up."

"Not my problem."

Sebastian had clearly planned this.

She tilted her head. "If you wanted in, you should’ve negotiated properly. Not like this."

"Negotiations failed because of you." His grin turned vicious. "Call him."

When she didn’t comply, he crushed his cigarette into an ashtray. "Need motivation? Fine." He gestured to the men. "Strip her."

They lunged before she could react, pinning her down.

Evelyn’s voice was steel. "Sebastian, Nathaniel will destroy you for this."
###Chapter 263

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the cool silk sheets beside her—empty. Nathaniel had already left for work.

She sighed, rolling onto her back. The events of last night replayed in her mind—the heated argument, the slammed door, the silence that followed. It wasn’t the first time they’d fought about her. Isabella’s name hung between them like a storm cloud, dark and unavoidable.

Evelyn sat up, rubbing her temples. She needed coffee.

Downstairs, Alfred was setting the breakfast table with his usual precision. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted, his voice smooth as ever. "Would you like your usual espresso?"

"Please," she murmured, sinking into a chair. The dining room felt too large, too quiet without Nathaniel’s presence.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Gregory: "Meeting at 10. The client wants revisions."

Evelyn groaned. The last thing she needed today was another demanding client. But work was her escape, her anchor. She typed a quick reply: "On my way."

As she sipped her espresso, her gaze drifted to the framed photo on the mantel—her and Nathaniel on their wedding day, smiling, oblivious to the storms ahead.

A knock at the door startled her. Alfred answered, and a moment later, Isabella stood in the doorway, her designer sunglasses perched atop her head, a smirk playing on her lips.

"Long time no see, Evelyn," she purred. "Mind if I come in?"

Evelyn’s grip tightened around her cup. The storm cloud had just rolled in.

The office was chaos. Gabrielle rushed to Evelyn’s side the moment she stepped in. "The client’s here already," she whispered urgently. "And he’s pissed."

Evelyn squared her shoulders. "Let’s handle this."

Gregory was in the conference room, his expression strained as Jonathan Blake from Summit Realty paced angrily. "This design is not what we agreed on!" he snapped.

Evelyn forced a calm smile. "Mr. Blake, let’s go over your concerns one by one."

Two hours later, the tension had barely eased. Jonathan finally left with a terse promise to review their revised proposal. Gregory collapsed into a chair. "That man is impossible."

Evelyn massaged her temples. "We’ll make it work."

Her phone buzzed again. A text from Nathaniel: "We need to talk. Tonight."

Her stomach twisted. She knew what that meant.

The penthouse was dimly lit when Evelyn returned. Nathaniel stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his silhouette tense against the city lights.

"You saw Isabella today," he said without turning around.

Evelyn dropped her bag onto the sofa. "She came to the house."

Nathaniel finally faced her, his jaw set. "She’s going through a hard time."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "And that’s our problem because...?"

"Evelyn." His voice was low, warning.

She exhaled sharply. "What do you want me to say, Nathaniel? That I’m okay with your ex waltzing back into our lives whenever she pleases?"

"It’s not like that."

"Then what is it like?"

The silence stretched between them, heavy and suffocating.

Nathaniel ran a hand through his hair. "I just need you to trust me."

Evelyn’s laugh was bitter. "Trust is a two-way street."

His phone rang. He glanced at the screen—Isabella—and hesitated.

Evelyn’s heart sank. "Answer it," she said quietly. "I’m going to bed."

She turned away before she could see him pick up the call.

Upstairs, she locked the bedroom door behind her. The tears came then, hot and relentless.

She had fought so hard for this marriage. But some battles, it seemed, were impossible to win.

Sebastian sneered, his lips curling into a cruel smirk. "Who do you think you are, Evelyn? Don't fool yourself into thinking I'm clueless. He doesn't love you—not even a little. His heart belongs to Isabella. You were just handpicked by Sir Edward. But with these photos, you’ll learn to obey me. Or else… you’ll regret it."

His eyes gleamed with malice as he raised his phone, snapping pictures of Evelyn despite her frantic struggles.

Evelyn’s blood ran cold. This wasn’t a bluff—he meant every word.

She fought desperately, but the two men holding her were too strong. Panic clawed at her throat as she gasped, "Sebastian, I’ll call Nathaniel! I swear I’ll convince him!"

Sebastian scoffed. "Oh? Suddenly you have a way? I don’t buy it. You’re just stalling."

Her plea fell on deaf ears, and terror coiled tighter in her chest.

Then—her phone rang.

All eyes snapped to the device on the table. Sebastian snatched it up, glancing at the screen. "Ah, Mr. Martin. Too bad he can’t know you’re here… yet." With a cruel smirk, he powered it off.

Evelyn’s blouse slipped from one shoulder as she thrashed. "You’ll pay for this, Sebastian!" she spat, her voice shaking with fury.

The men tightened their grip, unmoved. She glared at them, desperation sharpening her words. "Listen to me! I’m Nathaniel’s wife. Even if he doesn’t love me, the Martins won’t let this slide. And Paul? He adores me. The Mitchells will make sure you regret this!"

"Shut up!"

Sebastian yanked her hair so hard her vision blurred. Pain exploded across her scalp, white-hot and dizzying. "Keep talking. I dare you," he growled.

The agony unlocked something primal in her. With a surge of strength, she wrenched free and shoved him backward. He crashed into the table behind him, cursing.

Before she could react, he lunged. A brutal slap cracked across her face, sending her reeling. Then his hands closed around her throat, squeezing—

Darkness crept at the edges of her vision. Her lungs burned. Instinctively, her hands flew to her stomach, shielding the life growing inside. The baby…

Then—a scream.

The pressure vanished.

Gasping, Evelyn collapsed to the floor, coughing violently. Tears blurred her vision, but the scent of sandalwood and spice wrapped around her. A deep, familiar voice murmured, "Evelyn."

She clutched his shirt, trembling. "Nathaniel?"

"It’s me. You're safe now."

He lifted her gently onto the sofa, draping his coat over her. His touch was feather-light as he cupped her face. "Are you hurt? Do you need a doctor?"

She shook her head weakly. Her cheek throbbed, her scalp stung—but she was alive.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened as he traced the red marks on her skin. Then, with terrifying calm, he unbuttoned his cuffs.

"Wait here. Two minutes."

Before Sebastian could react, Nathaniel’s foot slammed into his ribs. He hit the floor with a grunt, but Nathaniel didn’t stop. Kick after kick landed with brutal precision.

Finally, Nathaniel hauled him up by the collar, his voice lethally quiet. "You dare lay a hand on my wife?"

Sebastian’s face paled.

Nathaniel’s fist connected with his jaw. "You’re dead."



###Chapter 264

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden streaks across her blueprints. She tapped her pen against the desk, lost in thought. The Martin Group project was nearing completion, but something felt off.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel.

"Dinner tonight? I have something to tell you."

Evelyn frowned. His tone was unreadable, even through text. She typed back a quick "Sure" before setting her phone aside.

Across the city, Nathaniel stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows of his penthouse, staring at the skyline. His grip tightened around his phone. He hadn’t slept well—not since Edward Martin had dropped the bombshell about the company’s financial discrepancies.

A knock interrupted his thoughts. Samuel Yates stepped in, holding a file.

"Sir, the audit reports are in."

Nathaniel took the folder, flipping through the pages. His jaw clenched. The numbers didn’t add up. Someone had been siphoning funds—and the trail led uncomfortably close to home.

Meanwhile, Isabella Davis lounged on her balcony, scrolling through social media. A smirk played on her lips as she lingered on a tagged photo of Evelyn and Nathaniel at a recent charity gala.

"Still playing the perfect couple, huh?" she muttered.

Her phone rang. Vanessa’s name flashed on the screen.

"Did you see the news?" Vanessa’s voice was sharp.

"What news?"

"Martin Group’s stocks just took a hit. Rumors are swirling about internal fraud."

Isabella’s smirk widened. "Interesting."

Back at the office, Evelyn’s assistant, Gabrielle, rushed in. "Evelyn, you need to see this." She handed over a tablet.

The headline blared: "Martin Group Under Investigation: Financial Irregularities Exposed."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. She reached for her phone, dialing Nathaniel’s number. It went straight to voicemail.

Her office door swung open. Gregory Wilson strode in, his expression grim. "We have a problem."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Tell me something I don’t know."

Gregory dropped a folder on her desk. "The Martin Group’s issues might affect our joint project. Investors are getting cold feet."

Evelyn’s mind raced. If the project collapsed, her firm’s reputation would be ruined.

And Nathaniel—where was he?

As if on cue, her phone buzzed again. A message from Caroline Sullivan:

"Call me. Now."

Evelyn’s fingers trembled as she dialed.

Caroline answered immediately. "Evelyn, listen carefully. I just got a tip. Someone’s framing Nathaniel."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. "Who?"

"I don’t know yet. But it’s someone close."

The line went dead.

Evelyn stared at her phone, dread pooling in her chest.

Someone was pulling strings in the shadows.

And Nathaniel was walking right into their trap.

Sebastian Wilson was brutally beaten by Nathaniel, completely defenseless, while his two henchmen were swiftly subdued by Samuel Yates.

Sebastian attempted to plead for mercy, but Nathaniel showed no interest in his excuses. The beating continued until Sebastian collapsed onto the marble floor, motionless as a corpse.

Nathaniel strode out of the villa with Evelyn cradled protectively in his arms. His voice was icy as he commanded, "I want Summit Realty erased from Mayby by dawn. As for him," he glanced back at the unconscious figure, "ensure he never resurfaces. Make it convincing."

Samuel gave a curt nod. "Consider it done."

By morning, the city would understand why.

Nathaniel rushed Evelyn straight to the hospital.

When she stirred awake, the sterile white walls greeted her once again. This marked her second hospitalization in just weeks.

Some luck I've been having lately, she thought wryly.

Turning her head, she found Nathaniel seated beside her bed. Before she could speak, his fingers brushed her cheek. "You're awake. Any pain?"

She shook her head weakly. "The baby?"

"Perfectly fine. No need to worry."

His reassurance loosened the knot in her chest.

Evelyn swallowed. "Can we go home? I don’t want to stay here."

Nathaniel studied her for a long moment before relenting. "Alright."

Since the doctors confirmed her stability, home was better.

Knowing she hadn’t eaten, he brought her warm broth. "Beatrice doesn’t know. I told her you had a late work dinner."

"Thank you," she murmured.

His jaw tightened at her formality, but he said nothing.

That night, while some slept soundly, others tossed restlessly in the dark.

In a dimly lit penthouse, Isabella paced like a caged panther. "How did this happen? The plan was flawless! Since when does Nathaniel track her movements?"

Donovan Sinclair swirled his whiskey, unfazed. "Overreacting will only draw his attention. Compose yourself, Isabella."

Her manicured nails dug into her palms. Despite the late hour, sleep was impossible.

Donovan rose and pulled her into an embrace. "I’ll handle it. Sebastian won’t talk. But," his grip tightened, "Nathaniel’s rage wasn’t just about Evelyn."

Isabella jerked back. "What else?"

His gaze turned scrutinizing. "Did you know Evelyn’s pregnant?"

Her breath hitched. "Pregnant?" The word slithered out like venom.

Impossible. Nathaniel had never mentioned it.

Yet suddenly, he refused the divorce.

The realization struck like lightning.

Isabella recoiled, putting distance between them. Her voice trembled with barely contained fury. "Is this a joke? Who told you this?"
###Chapter 265

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the design—a new eco-friendly residential complex for Martin Group. The project was ambitious, but she thrived under pressure.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Ms. Mitchell, Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn nodded. "Send him in."

Gregory entered with a stack of documents, his expression unreadable. "We have a problem," he said without preamble.

She arched a brow. "What kind of problem?"

"The zoning permits for the waterfront project have been delayed. Again." He dropped the files onto her desk. "The city council is demanding additional environmental impact assessments."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "That’s going to push our timeline back by weeks."

Gregory crossed his arms. "I’ve already spoken to Sebastian Wilson at Summit Realty. He’s willing to fast-track the approvals—for a price."

Her fingers tightened around her pen. "What kind of price?"

"A stake in the project."

Evelyn’s jaw clenched. Sebastian had been circling Martin Group’s developments for months, always looking for an opportunity to insert himself. She wouldn’t let him manipulate her. "No. We’ll handle this ourselves."

Gregory hesitated. "Evelyn, without those permits—"

"I’ll talk to Nathaniel," she cut in. "He has connections in the council."

Just as she reached for her phone, it buzzed with an incoming call—Nathaniel’s name flashed on the screen.

Speak of the devil.

She answered, her voice steady. "Nathaniel."

His tone was clipped. "We need to talk. Now."

Something in his voice sent a chill down her spine. "What’s wrong?"

"Not over the phone. Meet me at the penthouse."

The line went dead.

Evelyn stared at her phone, unease coiling in her stomach. Nathaniel rarely sounded like that—cold, distant. Whatever he had to say, it wasn’t good.

Gregory studied her. "Everything alright?"

She forced a smile. "Just a minor hiccup. I’ll handle it."

But as she gathered her things, her mind raced with possibilities. Had something happened with Isabella? The media had been relentless since the woman reappeared in their lives. Or was it something else entirely?

One thing was certain—whatever Nathaniel wanted to discuss would change everything.

Again.

After testing whether Isabella truly knew nothing about it, Donovan answered honestly, "Nathaniel took Evelyn straight to the hospital. I had someone look into it. She's definitely pregnant, and he only just found out."

Isabella went silent, her face turning ghostly pale.

He pressed on, "Isabella, he's not going to marry you. Are you really still waiting for him? Look at Evelyn—she’s carrying his child now. He doesn’t care about you. What’s so special about him that you can’t let go?"

Isabella clenched her jaw as Donovan’s words stoked the fire of her resentment.

She rose from the couch, her gaze icy as she stared at him. "I'm leaving. Handle today’s mess yourself."

Donovan’s eyes narrowed, his expression darkening. "So, you’re just going to discard me after using me?" he asked coolly.

Isabella frowned.

Donovan smirked. "Isabella, I don’t do charity work."

Before she could react, he yanked her into his arms and crushed his lips against hers.

Two hours later, Isabella drove away from the villa, her hair disheveled, a mask and hat hiding her face.

Her grip on the steering wheel was white-knuckled, her expression hollow.

As she drove, a sharp pang of frustration twisted inside her. She pulled over by the river, lit a cigarette, and took a long drag. Her phone weighed heavily in her hand. After a moment’s hesitation, she dialed a number.

The call connected quickly.

A deep voice answered. "Hello? You’re still awake?"

"Did you know Evelyn is pregnant?" Isabella demanded coldly.

Silence. Then, "Who told you?"

"That doesn’t matter. What matters is that she didn’t tell you, did she? You’re just a tool to her. If she really considered you a friend, why keep something this important from you?"

Isabella’s voice trembled with barely contained fury. She took another drag, about to say more, when the line went dead.

She glared at her phone, scoffed, and tossed it aside. The night sky stretched endlessly above her, but her mood was anything but calm.

She wouldn’t back down.

Evelyn won’t win. Nathaniel is mine. He owes me everything.

Her resolve hardened.

The next day, Evelyn was ordered by Nathaniel to stay home and rest.

"And from now on," he added, "if you want to visit the construction site, you’ll take the driver. I’ll arrange one for you."

Evelyn shot him a look. "I’m not paying for that."

"I will."

"Fine."

"Anything else?"

Nathaniel studied her.

She hesitated, unsure what he was expecting. "...Thanks?"



###Chapter 266

The moment Nathaniel stepped into the dimly lit study, the weight of his grandfather’s presence pressed down on him. Edward Martin sat behind the mahogany desk, his sharp gaze cutting through the silence like a blade.

"You're late," Edward remarked, his voice cool and measured.

Nathaniel clenched his jaw but didn’t offer an excuse. He knew better than to argue.

"I assume you’ve heard the news," Edward continued, tapping a stack of papers on the desk. "The board is questioning your leadership after the recent scandal."

Nathaniel’s fingers twitched at his side. The media had been relentless, dragging his past with Isabella into the spotlight again.

"I’ll handle it," he said, his tone firm.

Edward scoffed. "Handle it? You’ve let personal matters interfere with business one too many times."

Nathaniel met his grandfather’s gaze head-on. "I won’t let it affect the company."

Edward leaned back in his chair, studying him. "See that you don’t. The Martins don’t tolerate weakness."

The words stung, but Nathaniel refused to show it. He had spent his entire life proving himself, and he wasn’t about to let one mistake define him.

Meanwhile, Evelyn sat in her office, staring at the blueprints spread across her desk. The project was due soon, but her mind kept drifting back to Nathaniel. The tension between them had been unbearable since the scandal broke.

A knock on the door pulled her from her thoughts.

"Evelyn?" Gregory stepped in, concern etched on his face. "You okay?"

She forced a smile. "Just tired."

Gregory hesitated before speaking. "Look, I know things are rough right now, but you can’t let it distract you. This project is important."

Evelyn sighed. "I know."

He gave her a reassuring pat on the shoulder. "Hang in there."

As he left, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A message from Isabella flashed on the screen.

"We need to talk."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. She had avoided confronting Isabella, but it seemed fate had other plans.

Downstairs, Alfred intercepted Nathaniel as he stormed out of the study.

"Sir, a word?"

Nathaniel barely slowed his pace. "Not now."

Alfred persisted. "It’s about Miss Evelyn."

That stopped him cold. Nathaniel turned, his expression unreadable. "What about her?"

Alfred lowered his voice. "She received a message from Miss Isabella. I thought you should know."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. He didn’t need this right now.

"Keep an eye on her," he ordered before striding away.

Back in her office, Evelyn stared at Isabella’s message, her fingers hovering over the screen.

She took a deep breath and typed a reply.

"Where and when?"

The response came instantly.

"Tonight. The old café by the river. 8 PM."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Whatever Isabella wanted, it couldn’t be good.

But she had to face this. For herself. For Nathaniel.

Even if it shattered everything.

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed slightly, his voice icy. "Evelyn, you're merciless."

Without another word, he turned on his heel and strode toward the door.

Evelyn was left bewildered. Merciless? How?

She sighed, pressing a hand to her temple. After last night's incident, she had to be cautious—for her own safety and the baby's.

Once Nathaniel left for the office, Evelyn remained alone in the penthouse. The faint bruise on her cheek made her hesitant to visit Beatrice next door, so she made an excuse to stay away.

Curled up on the sofa, she scrolled through her phone when Gabrielle suddenly sent her a series of screenshots on WhatsApp.

Before she could process them, Gabrielle's call came through.

"Ms. Mitchell, have you seen the news?" Gabrielle's voice crackled with excitement. "Summit Realty went bankrupt overnight! Their office was vandalized, and Sebastian got arrested. It's all over social media—the police confirmed he's being held for illegal activities!"

Evelyn knew exactly what this meant.

A slow, knowing smile curved her lips. "I'm not coming in today. Enjoy the gossip—no one will dock your pay."

Summit Realty and Sebastian had brought this upon themselves. She felt no sympathy.

Yet, Sebastian's words still echoed in her mind.

Was there a connection?

Maybe she was overthinking.

With a blank expression, she browsed Mayby's forums, skimming through the chaos surrounding Summit Realty. The employees were the only ones who truly suffered.

That afternoon, after a nap, her phone buzzed—Gregory was calling.

"Evelyn, I'm back," he said warmly. "Dinner tonight? Are you free?"

It had been weeks since they'd last met. She agreed without hesitation.

They chose a hotpot place near the office. When Evelyn arrived, Gregory was already seated, the table laden with her favorite dishes.

His gaze immediately zeroed in on her cheek. "What happened?" he demanded, brows furrowing.

"Just a minor accident." She deftly changed the subject. "Did you hear about Summit Realty?"

He nodded, taking a sip of water. "Sebastian's downfall—did it have anything to do with your injury?"

She didn’t hide it. She recounted the previous night’s events.

Gregory’s expression darkened. "He deserved worse. Rotting in prison is too good for him." His eyes scanned her worriedly. "Any other injuries?"

"Just this."

A waiter arrived with their food. Gregory silently began cooking the ingredients for her.

Noticing his subdued mood, Evelyn tilted her head. "Gregory, is something bothering you?"

He forced a faint smile. "Just tired."

"How’s Danielle? Any improvement?"

"She came back to Mayby with me." He exhaled heavily. "My parents insisted I look after her. She’ll be staying with me for a while."

The exhaustion in his voice was palpable. He’d clearly lost weight, his usual vibrancy dimmed.

Evelyn hesitated. Family matters were delicate.

A brief silence settled between them.



###Chapter 267

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort in the Maldives. The design was bold, innovative, and exactly the kind of challenge she thrived on.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, not looking up.

The door opened, and Gabrielle, her assistant, stepped inside, holding a steaming cup of coffee. "You’ve been at this since dawn," she said, placing the cup beside Evelyn’s elbow. "Thought you could use this."

Evelyn smiled gratefully, wrapping her hands around the warm mug. "Thanks, Gabrielle. You’re a lifesaver."

Gabrielle hesitated, then added, "Nathaniel called earlier. He said he’d be late for dinner tonight. Something about an unexpected meeting with the board."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the cup. Lately, Nathaniel had been pulling longer hours, and though she understood the demands of running Martin Group, she couldn’t shake the unease settling in her chest.

"Did he say when he’d be home?" she asked, keeping her tone light.

Gabrielle shook her head. "Just that he’d call you later."

Evelyn nodded, forcing a smile. "Alright. Thanks for letting me know."

As Gabrielle left, Evelyn exhaled slowly, her gaze drifting back to the blueprints. But her focus was shattered.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Caroline.

"Heard from a little bird that Isabella is back in town. Thought you should know."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Isabella Davis—Nathaniel’s first love, the woman who had once held his heart before Evelyn came into the picture.

She hadn’t seen Isabella in years, not since that disastrous gala where their paths had last crossed. The memory still stung.

Evelyn set her phone down, her pulse quickening.

Why was Isabella back now?

And more importantly—did Nathaniel know?

The questions swirled in her mind, but before she could dwell on them, her office phone rang.

It was Gregory.

"Evelyn, we’ve got a problem," he said, his voice tense. "The client just called. They want to move up the deadline by two weeks."

Evelyn groaned. "That’s impossible. We’re already stretched thin."

"I know, but they’re insisting. Said they’ll pull the contract if we can’t deliver."

Evelyn pinched the bridge of her nose. "Alright. Call the team. We’ll need to work overtime."

As she hung up, Evelyn glanced at the clock. Another late night ahead.

And Nathaniel wouldn’t even be home.

The weight of it all pressed down on her, but she squared her shoulders. She had a company to run, a reputation to uphold.

But beneath the surface, a storm was brewing.

And Isabella’s return was only the beginning.

Gregory hesitated for a moment before asking carefully, "Evelyn, have you put on a little weight lately? But I noticed you barely touched your food. Are you feeling okay?"

Evelyn shook her head lightly. "No, I'm fine. Maybe it's because I had lunch late. I wasn't very hungry yet."

Gregory paused, his expression unreadable. Then, as if changing the subject, he said, "By the way, how are things between you and Nathaniel? Any progress?"

"Same as before."

"Still planning to go through with the divorce?"

Evelyn fell silent.

She met Gregory's gaze, hesitation flickering in her eyes.

When she didn’t respond, Gregory pressed on, "Evelyn, I’m not trying to push you. I just want to remind you—if you’re serious about leaving, it’s better to do it sooner rather than later. In a family like the Martins, once you’re pregnant, cutting ties won’t be easy."

Evelyn’s brows furrowed instinctively. The truth was, her pregnancy wasn’t exactly a secret anymore.

She had intended to tell Gregory, but the way he spoke made her wonder if he already knew and was testing her.

Evelyn kept her voice steady. "Gregory, do you already know I’m pregnant?"

His expression darkened. He didn’t answer, but his eyes never left hers.

They stared at each other for a long moment before Evelyn finally smiled faintly. "Yes, I am. It’s been over three months now. I didn’t tell you because I was conflicted. And then, with the divorce plans… I kept it to myself. Besides you, the only person who knows is Charlotte, and that’s only because she came to Mayby."

Gregory’s handsome face remained impassive, but disappointment flickered in his eyes. Still, he forced a small smile. "Congratulations."

Evelyn studied him carefully.

Gregory continued, "Evelyn, you’ve waited so long for this. Now that you’re expecting, I’m sure Nathaniel will treasure you. At the very least, you’ll finally have the chance to be together properly. That’s all I’ve ever wanted—for you to be happy."

Evelyn lowered her gaze, understanding the unspoken implication.

He was telling her that if Nathaniel ever showed her affection, it would only be because of the baby.

Her mind spun.

When she looked up again, her eyes were shadowed.

Softly, she said, "Gregory, I know what you’re implying. Honestly, I never expected Nathaniel to love me. And this baby… it’s not a bargaining chip to keep him tied to me."

"Evelyn, that’s not what I meant. I’m sorry. Maybe I phrased it wrong. I just don’t want to see you hurt. I want you to take care of yourself and not lose sight of who you are because of love."

"Of course. I understand, Gregory. Thank you. I know you mean well. But don’t worry—I know exactly what I want and what I don’t."

Her response left him speechless.

They finished their meal before seven.

Gregory offered, "Should I drive you back?"

"No, it’s fine. Danielle is here with you. You should get back to her—she’s new to Mayby and probably needs you more than I do."

Evelyn declined politely, and Gregory didn’t insist.

She took a cab back to the apartment, only to find Nathaniel stepping out of his car just as she arrived.

Their eyes locked.

Nathaniel strode toward her, his gaze intense. "Where were you?"

"I went out for dinner."

"You’ve already eaten?"

"Yes."

"Why didn’t you tell me? I canceled my plans to have dinner with you."

Evelyn exhaled. "Nathaniel, you don’t have to do this. It’s… too much pressure."

His eyes narrowed. "So now I’m the problem?"
###Chapter 268

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden streaks across her blueprints. She tapped her pen absently against the desk, her mind wandering to Nathaniel's unexpected call last night. His voice had been strained, almost hesitant—uncharacteristic for the usually confident heir of Martin Group.

A knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, poked her head in. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn straightened. "Send him in."

Gregory strode in, his usual composed demeanor replaced by visible tension. "We have a problem," he said without preamble. "The permits for the waterfront project have been delayed again."

She frowned. "How? We submitted everything weeks ago."

"City Hall claims there are zoning issues." He dropped a file onto her desk. "But I think someone’s pulling strings behind the scenes."

Evelyn flipped through the documents, her stomach tightening. If this project stalled, their firm’s reputation would take a hit—and worse, Nathaniel’s grandfather, Edward Martin, would see it as proof she wasn’t fit to stand beside his grandson.

Her phone buzzed. A text from Nathaniel:

We need to talk. Tonight. Alone.

Her fingers hovered over the screen. Something was wrong. Very wrong.

Across town, Nathaniel stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows of his penthouse, staring at the city skyline. His jaw clenched as he replayed the conversation with his father earlier.

"You’re making a mistake, Nathaniel. That girl doesn’t belong in this family."

His phone rang—Isabella. Again. He ignored it, just like the last three calls. She’d been relentless since returning to town, stirring up old rumors, whispering in the right ears.

A soft chime announced Samuel’s arrival. "Sir, the board meeting starts in twenty minutes."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "Cancel it."

Samuel blinked. "But—"

"Reschedule everything. I have somewhere to be."

Because if there was one thing he knew, it was this: Evelyn was his future. And he’d burn the city down before letting anyone take her from him.

That evening, Evelyn arrived at their usual spot—a secluded garden terrace overlooking the bay. Nathaniel was already there, his back to her, shoulders rigid.

She approached slowly. "You’re scaring me."

He turned, and the raw intensity in his eyes stole her breath. "They’re coming for you, Evelyn."

Her pulse spiked. "Who?"

"Everyone." His voice was low, dangerous. "My family. Isabella. Even your so-called partners." He stepped closer, cupping her face. "But I won’t let them win."

The vow hung between them, heavy as the gathering storm clouds overhead.

Because this wasn’t just a fight for their love.


Evelyn opened her mouth to explain, but at the last second, she changed her mind.

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "It's not that I mean anything by it. It's just... your sudden shift in behavior unsettles me. We don’t have to lose ourselves just because of the baby."

Nathaniel’s tenderness could easily be mistaken for something deeper—something Evelyn knew better than to hope for. And that realization stung more than she cared to admit.

Their eyes locked, an unspoken tension thickening the air between them. Neither spoke.

Back at the penthouse, Evelyn showered, then deliberately let her damp hair fall over her face before slipping into Beatrice’s room.

Beatrice barely glanced up from her book, irritation flashing in her sharp gaze. "Must you barge in here every time? Can’t an old woman have a moment’s peace?"

Evelyn blinked, taken aback. "Grandma, since when do you need peace from me? You used to say I was your whole world. What changed?"

"People change."

"But this?" Evelyn gestured between them. "This is cruel."

"Enough." Beatrice snapped her book shut. "I’m reading. Either sit quietly or leave."

Evelyn sighed but didn’t argue. Beatrice was teasing her—she had to be. Still, after lingering a few minutes, she retreated.

The caregiver—a warm-faced woman from Dattlech whom Evelyn had personally hired—watched her go before turning to Beatrice. "You don’t miss her at all?"

"What good would missing her do?" Beatrice set the book aside, her expression weary. "I won’t be here forever. She needs to find someone who will."

Her fingers trembled slightly as she reached for the pills.

"You’ve increased the dosage?" the caregiver frowned. "It was three before."

"I need to recover faster. The baby’s coming soon, and Evelyn will need help." Beatrice’s voice brooked no argument. "If she asks, tell her everything’s normal. Understood?"

The next morning, Nathaniel drove Evelyn to work.

Just before they reached the office, he surprised her. "Lunch. Today."

"With who?"

"Me."

"That’s it?"

His lips quirked. "Unless you’d like to count the baby as a third guest."

Evelyn exhaled. "Fine."

He promised to pick her up at noon, warning her not to wander off. She nodded, stepping out of the car without another word.

Inside, she met Gregory in his office to review project updates. His phone buzzed incessantly, but he kept dismissing the calls.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Not answering? Should I go?"

"It’s Danielle."

"Then answer. It might be important."

With a grimace, Gregory finally picked up. Danielle’s shrill voice carried through the speaker, sharp enough for Evelyn to hear. "Gregory! Why do you keep ignoring me? Are you with her again? She’s married, for God’s sake! Why can’t she leave you alone?"

Gregory’s jaw tightened. He shot Evelyn an apologetic glance before hissing into the phone, "Danielle, stop. I’m working. We’ve talked about this. Pull yourself together."

A sob crackled through the line. Danielle was spiraling again.


###Chapter 269

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. She traced a finger along the intricate lines of her latest design, a luxury resort that would soon become Nathaniel's newest venture. The project had consumed her thoughts for weeks, but today, something else weighed heavily on her mind.

Her phone buzzed, snapping her out of her reverie. A message from Nathaniel lit up the screen:

"Meeting at the penthouse in an hour. We need to talk."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. His tone was unreadable—firm, yet devoid of warmth. She hadn't seen him since their argument three days ago, when Isabella had unexpectedly reappeared at a gala, clinging to Nathaniel's arm like a ghost from the past.

She exhaled sharply, gathering her sketches into a leather portfolio. Whatever this was about, she wouldn’t let it shake her.

The penthouse was eerily silent when she arrived. Nathaniel stood by the window, his broad shoulders tense, his gaze fixed on the city below. He didn’t turn when she entered.

"You wanted to talk," Evelyn said, keeping her voice steady.

He finally faced her, his expression unreadable. "Isabella is staying in town."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her portfolio. "For how long?"

"Indefinitely."

A cold knot formed in her stomach. "And you’re telling me this because...?"

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched. "Because I need you to understand—this isn’t about us. It’s business."

"Business?" She arched a brow. "Funny, she didn’t seem all that professional when she was draped over you at the gala."

His eyes darkened. "That wasn’t my doing."

"Then whose was it?"

The silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken accusations.

Finally, Nathaniel sighed, running a hand through his hair. "She’s here for the resort project. Her company is bidding for the interior design contract."

Evelyn scoffed. "Convenient."

"Evelyn—"

"No." She held up a hand. "If this is just business, then treat it that way. But if there’s even a chance that you’re letting her back into your life—"

"I’m not." His voice was firm, but his eyes flickered with something she couldn’t decipher.

She wanted to believe him. But the past had a way of repeating itself.

Her phone buzzed again—Gregory this time. "Emergency at the site. Need you here ASAP."

Evelyn exhaled, grateful for the distraction. "I have to go."

Nathaniel didn’t stop her.

As the elevator doors closed behind her, she allowed herself one shaky breath.

Because if Isabella was back, then the game had just changed.

And Evelyn wasn’t sure she was ready to play.

Evelyn sensed it was time for her to leave. She rose from her seat and gestured toward the door. Gregory gave a slight nod, his gaze lingering as she stepped out and quietly shut the door behind her.

Inside, silence stretched as Gregory endured Danielle’s irrational outburst. Only when her voice cracked with frustration did he finally speak.

"Danielle," he said, his tone firm, "what was your promise before coming to Mayby? If this continues, I’ll have no choice but to send you back."

Danielle’s voice turned pleading. "Gregory, I know I messed up, but everything I did was for you—"

"Enough. I have work to do."

He ended the call abruptly, tossing his phone onto the desk with a frustrated exhale. His mood was dark, the weight of the argument pressing heavily on him.

After taking a moment to collect himself, Gregory grabbed the project files he had intended to discuss with Evelyn and headed to her office.

The project in question was a prestigious architecture competition hosted by the Martin Group. Announced six months prior, the preliminary round was set for next month, followed by semifinals and finals—three rounds in total to determine the top three winners.

Gregory had previously explained to Evelyn that the winners would secure positions in the nation’s leading architectural design institute. The champion, in particular, would earn the coveted role of chief architect for the city’s next landmark building.

It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

For any architect, this wasn’t just a competition—it was the realization of a dream.

Admission to the institute was already the pinnacle of success, but becoming the chief architect of a city’s defining structure? That was the ultimate achievement.

Gregory laid out the competition’s details meticulously, ensuring Evelyn understood every aspect. Then, he leaned forward slightly. "So, Evelyn, what do you think? Are you interested?"

Evelyn didn’t answer right away.

The competition spanned three months. If it were just about her pregnancy, she might have agreed without hesitation.

But uncertainty held her back.

"I need time to think," she admitted.

"Is something bothering you?"

"Not exactly. I just… worry I might not perform well."

Gregory chuckled softly. "That’s impossible. I know your skills better than anyone. If you decide to compete, the championship is as good as yours."

Evelyn offered a faint smile but remained silent.

Her thoughts raced ahead. If she entered and succeeded—if she made it to the top three—her baby would already be born by then. But what would her relationship with Nathaniel look like at that point? That uncertainty made her hesitate.

And if she failed to place at all? Then the entire endeavor would be pointless.

Gregory didn’t push her. "Take your time," he said. "Think it through carefully. Let me know once you’ve made your decision."

At noon, Evelyn’s phone buzzed with a call from Nathaniel.

"I’ll be there in ten," he said. "Be ready to head downstairs."

She was already prepared and decided to wait outside early.

The sky was overcast, but the breeze was pleasant. Evelyn stood by the roadside, scanning the street for Nathaniel’s car.

But barely two minutes passed before a white sedan pulled up in front of her. Her first thought was Nathaniel—until the door swung open and Danielle stormed out.

Danielle slammed the car door shut and marched toward Evelyn, her expression livid.

"Evelyn," she spat, "how shameless can you be? Why do you keep clinging to Gregory? Can’t you just stay away from him?"

Evelyn’s brows drew together. "Danielle, we’re colleagues. And I’m married. You have nothing to worry about."

"Married and still acting like this? You’re disgusting!" Danielle’s voice rose, drawing glances from passersby as the lunchtime crowd thickened. "Cut ties with him. Stop contacting him!"

Evelyn had no interest in continuing this argument. She turned to walk away, putting distance between them.

But then—

The roar of an engine.

Evelyn barely had time to react before Danielle’s car lurched forward, tires screeching as it accelerated straight toward her.
###Chapter 270

The tension in the room was palpable as Evelyn stood frozen in the doorway, her fingers tightening around the doorknob. Nathaniel's back was turned to her, his broad shoulders rigid with unspoken emotions. The dim lighting cast long shadows across his profile, accentuating the sharp line of his jaw.

"Evelyn," he said without turning around, his voice rough with exhaustion. "We need to talk."

Her heart pounded against her ribs. She had known this moment would come ever since Isabella's unexpected return. The air between them crackled with unresolved history, like a storm waiting to break.

"I'm listening," she managed, stepping further into the room. The scent of his cologne—something woodsy and expensive—filled her senses, stirring memories she'd tried so hard to bury.

Nathaniel finally turned, his dark eyes meeting hers. There was something raw in his gaze, a vulnerability she hadn't seen since their early days together. "It's not what you think," he began, running a hand through his already disheveled hair.

Evelyn crossed her arms, bracing herself. "Then tell me what it is, Nathaniel. Because from where I'm standing, it looks like your past just walked right back into our lives."

A muscle twitched in his jaw. "Isabella showed up unannounced. She's in trouble, Evelyn. The kind of trouble that could—"

"Could what?" Evelyn interrupted, her voice sharper than she intended. "Could ruin us? Because that's what this feels like."

The silence that followed was deafening. Somewhere in the mansion, a clock ticked relentlessly, counting down the seconds of their strained peace.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "I made a promise a long time ago. One I can't break, even now." He took a step closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. "But you need to know—you're my present. My future. That hasn't changed."

Evelyn wanted to believe him. Desperately. But the ghost of Isabella's smirk as she'd brushed past her earlier that evening lingered in her mind like a poison. "Promises are just words, Nathaniel. It's actions that matter."

Outside, the wind howled against the windows, rattling the panes as if echoing her turmoil. The storm wasn't just coming—it was already here. And Evelyn wasn't sure their love could weather it this time.

Nathaniel reached for her, his fingers brushing her wrist. "Give me tonight," he pleaded. "Just tonight to make this right."

She pulled away, her throat tight. "And if you can't?"

His answer was a whisper lost in the space between them, a confession that would change everything. The chapter closed on Evelyn's sharp intake of breath, the truth hanging in the air like a guillotine's blade.

The roar of an engine shattered the evening calm. Evelyn instinctively turned, her breath catching as a white sedan barreled toward her at terrifying speed.

Muscle memory took over. She leaped aside just in time. Rush hour crowds scattered like frightened birds as Danielle's vehicle carved chaos through the pavement.

Fury twisted Danielle's features when her initial strike missed. The steering wheel jerked violently beneath her manicured hands, tires screeching as she corrected course straight for Evelyn again. Madness glazed her eyes - she'd decided Evelyn needed to disappear.

Nathaniel's black sedan screeched to a halt amidst the pandemonium. He took in the screaming pedestrians with a thunderous expression before spotting Evelyn's pale face in the melee.

"Evelyn!" His voice cut through the noise as he grabbed her trembling shoulders.

She gasped, wild-eyed, until recognition dawned. "N-Nathaniel?"

His jaw tightened as he shielded her body with his own, already dialing emergency services with one hand while summoning Samuel with the other.

Evelyn's fingers clutched his sleeve. "It's Gregory's sister," she whispered urgently. "Danielle Parker. She's... not well. I should call him."

Nathaniel's silence was volcanic.

After a tense beat, Evelyn made the call. Only Gregory could defuse this bomb before someone got hurt.

True to form, Gregory materialized within minutes. He threw himself before the still-revving car, pounding the hood. "Danielle! Enough!" His bellow carried across the parking lot.

Behind the windshield, Danielle's lips twisted into something feral. "Move, Gregory! That witch needs to pay! Why does she still cling to you? Why do you protect her?"

"Because you're committing a crime!" Gregory snarled. "Hit me instead if you're so determined to destroy lives!"

Their standoff shattered when Danielle stomped the wrong pedal. The car lurched forward, slamming Gregory onto the hood. He clung desperately as she screamed for him to move, the vehicle now careening wildly.

It took three police cruisers to box her in. Gregory tumbled free with minor scrapes, immediately pleading with officers. "She's ill, she didn't mean—"

"I made the call." Nathaniel's icy pronouncement silenced him. The two men locked gazes like rival predators as Evelyn hovered between them.

"Evelyn," Gregory turned desperately, "you know her condition. This was a breakdown, not malice. Give her this one chance—"

"My pregnant wife could have died today." Nathaniel's voice was steel wrapped in velvet. "As could dozens of bystanders. Mental illness explains; it doesn't excuse."

The handcuffs clicked shut on Danielle's wrists as Evelyn watched, her own hands unconsciously cradling the life growing within her.
###Chapter 271

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, her body still heavy with sleep. Beside her, Nathaniel lay motionless, his breathing steady and deep. She studied his profile—the sharp jawline, the dark lashes resting against his cheeks. Even in sleep, he exuded an air of quiet authority.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand, shattering the peaceful silence. With a sigh, she reached for it, squinting at the screen. A message from Gregory flashed before her eyes:

"Emergency meeting at the office. 9 AM. Be there."

Evelyn frowned. Gregory wasn’t one for dramatics, so if he called it an emergency, it had to be serious. She slipped out of bed, careful not to wake Nathaniel, and padded toward the bathroom.

The hot shower did little to ease the tension coiling in her stomach. She dressed quickly—a tailored blazer, slim trousers, her usual armor for battle. By the time she emerged, Nathaniel was awake, leaning against the doorframe, watching her with those piercing blue eyes.

"Trouble?" he asked, his voice rough with sleep.

"Gregory called a meeting," she said, fastening her watch. "No details."

Nathaniel crossed the room in three strides, catching her wrist. "Let me send Samuel with you."

She shook her head. "I can handle it."

His grip tightened slightly, a silent protest, but he released her. "Call me if you need anything."

Evelyn pressed a quick kiss to his lips before grabbing her bag and heading out. The drive to the office was a blur of city streets and honking cars. Her mind raced with possibilities—had they lost a client? Was there a problem with the new project?

When she stepped into the conference room, the tension was palpable. Gregory stood at the head of the table, his expression grim. Gabrielle, her assistant, was already there, clutching a tablet like a lifeline.

"What’s going on?" Evelyn demanded.

Gregory exhaled sharply. "Summit Realty just pulled out of the Riverside deal."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. "What? Why?"

"Sebastian Wilson claims we breached contract," Gregory said, tossing a folder onto the table. "He’s threatening legal action."

Evelyn snatched the folder, scanning the documents inside. Her pulse pounded in her ears. This wasn’t just a minor setback—this could ruin them.

Gabrielle cleared her throat. "There’s more. Jonathan Blake called. He said Summit is taking all their future projects to another firm."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the papers. This wasn’t just business. This was personal.

And she knew exactly who was behind it.

Isabella.

The name burned in her mind like a brand. Nathaniel’s ex had never stopped scheming, and now she’d struck where it hurt most.

Evelyn looked up, her voice steady despite the storm inside her.

"Then we fight back."

Nathaniel didn’t give Evelyn a chance to respond to Gregory’s words. With sharp precision, he laid out the facts, and the surrounding crowd quickly grasped that this was no accident—it was premeditated. The fact that Evelyn was pregnant only intensified the gravity of the situation.

Danielle was escorted away by the police.

Gregory attempted to reason with Nathaniel, but Nathaniel merely arched a brow and countered, "Danielle’s actions were deliberate, and they were aimed at you, Mr. Wilson. Do you truly expect me to overlook this—or should she face the consequences?"

A knowing smirk played on Nathaniel’s lips as Gregory fell silent.

Their gazes clashed for a tense moment before Nathaniel took Evelyn’s hand and led her firmly toward his car.

"Samuel," he ordered, his voice clipped, "gather the witnesses and security footage. Submit everything to the authorities. Let the law handle this properly."

Samuel nodded and departed. Once inside the car, Nathaniel turned to Evelyn, who sat stiffly in the passenger seat. His voice softened, though his tone remained edged with irritation. "Why so quiet?"

Evelyn blinked, as if snapping out of a daze. Truthfully, she hadn’t been given the opportunity to speak at all.

She hesitated before asking, "What did you mean by what you said to him earlier?"

Nathaniel’s lips curled slightly. "Why does it matter? Are you planning to let her off?"

Evelyn didn’t answer immediately. Of course, she wasn’t. Danielle’s actions had been reckless, dangerous. If not for sheer luck—and Nathaniel’s timely intervention—things could have ended much worse.

She couldn’t risk Danielle doing something like this again.

Still, curiosity gnawed at her. "I want to understand," she pressed.

Nathaniel studied her for a long moment before responding. "Do you think Gregory’s reaction was the right way to handle this?"

Evelyn frowned, uncertain.

Wasn’t it?

She looked up at him, confused.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "He didn’t defend his sister. He didn’t try to calm her down. Instead, he provoked her, ensuring everyone saw her lose control. The law doesn’t care if the victim is her brother—intent to harm is still a crime."

His words struck Evelyn like a physical blow.

Her expression darkened as she absorbed them.

Nathaniel tilted his head. "What’s on your mind?"

"Nothing," she murmured.

His jaw tightened. "Do you think I’m twisting the truth? That I’m framing him?"

His tone was icy, his displeasure unmistakable.

Evelyn shook her head quickly. "No. I don’t think that."

"Really?"

"Yes."

Nathaniel let the subject drop. He checked his watch, then glanced back at her. "Let’s get something to eat."

Evelyn nodded, and the car pulled away.

Lunch was a quiet affair, the air between them thick with unspoken tension. Nathaniel’s mood was palpably sour, and Evelyn, unsure how to bridge the gap, stayed silent.

Just as they finished, Samuel called.

"Mr. Martin, all evidence has been submitted. The police will charge Danielle with attempted assault."

"Good," Nathaniel replied curtly.

Before Samuel could ask for further instructions, Evelyn’s phone buzzed.

Gregory.

He must have heard from the authorities already.

Her eyes flicked to Nathaniel before she answered. "Gregory?"

"Evelyn," Gregory’s voice was strained, "please—give Danielle another chance. For me. I know I have no right to ask this. What she did was unforgivable. But this is my fault. I should have taken better care of her. I’m so sorry."

Evelyn exhaled slowly. "Gregory, if I let this go now, can you promise she won’t try something like this again?"

No harm had been done—this time. But the thought of what could have happened sent a chill down her spine.
###Chapter 272

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her blueprints. She tapped her pen against the desk, lost in thought. The recent events had left her restless—Nathaniel's sudden trip to London, Isabella's unexpected return, and the whispers circulating through Martin Group.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel:

"Meeting ran late. Will be home by dinner."

Evelyn exhaled. His texts had been brief lately, devoid of the warmth she was used to. She typed a quick reply before tossing her phone aside.

Gabrielle, her assistant, knocked lightly on the door. "Evelyn, Gregory is here to see you."

Evelyn straightened. "Send him in."

Gregory strode in, his usual confident demeanor slightly off. He dropped into the chair opposite her, running a hand through his hair. "We have a problem."

Evelyn arched a brow. "What now?"

"The Summit Realty deal. Sebastian Wilson is pushing for revisions—again." He slid a folder across the desk. "He wants changes to the structural design. Says it’s ‘too modern’ for their clientele."

Evelyn flipped through the documents, her jaw tightening. "This is the third time he’s backtracked. We can’t keep redesigning based on his whims."

Gregory sighed. "I know. But if we lose this contract..."

She met his gaze. "Then we’ll find another client. I won’t compromise the integrity of our work."

Before Gregory could respond, her phone rang—Caroline.

Evelyn answered. "Hey, what’s up?"

Caroline’s voice was tense. "You need to see this." A link buzzed through.

Evelyn opened it. A gossip column headline screamed:

"Isabella Davis Spotted Leaving Martin Group CEO’s Hotel—Reconciliation in the Works?"

Her stomach dropped. The accompanying photo showed Isabella stepping out of a luxury car, the same hotel Nathaniel was staying at in London visible in the background.

Gregory frowned. "Everything okay?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Fine. Just… personal stuff."

But her mind raced.

Was this why Nathaniel had been distant?

She stood abruptly. "I need to go."

Gregory studied her. "You sure you’re alright?"

"No," she admitted quietly. "But I will be."

As she grabbed her coat, one thought consumed her:

She needed answers. Now.

Gregory was silent.

He understood exactly what Evelyn meant, but he couldn't outright promise there wouldn't be a next time. Danielle's condition was complicated.

The line went quiet for a long moment.

Finally, Gregory spoke, his voice rough. "Evelyn, I know what you're asking. But you and I both know Danielle is my sister—and a Parker. So I... Please, do this as a personal favor to me. Just this once, alright?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, conflicted.

She wasn’t naive. She had no sympathy for those who hurt her. But Gregory had helped her countless times before. The debt weighed on her.

Gregory didn’t push further. He only asked her to think it over. In the background, Danielle’s muffled sobs echoed from the police station.

After hanging up, Evelyn exhaled slowly and turned to Nathaniel.

He had just finished his call with Samuel. Their eyes met, and Nathaniel arched a brow. "Something on your mind?"

Evelyn gave him a wry smile. "You already know, don’t you?"

He scoffed. "For Gregory’s sake, you’d risk yourself—and our child?"

"That’s not what I meant."

"Aren’t you going to beg for Danielle’s release?"

Nathaniel’s gaze turned icy, his voice flat.

Evelyn hesitated. "I’m not pleading for her. I’m not that forgiving." She clenched her fists, choosing her words carefully. "But she didn’t know I was pregnant. I was careless too."

Nathaniel said nothing, but the coldness in his eyes deepened.

She swallowed hard before adding softly, "Nathaniel, could you... let her go after she’s learned her lesson?"

A humorless laugh escaped him.

"You want mercy for the woman who tried to run you over?"

"It’s not mercy. I’m fine, and she’s Gregory’s sister. I—" Evelyn faltered, worried Nathaniel might blame Gregory. "I won’t let myself be hurt again. This is the last time. Please?"

Nathaniel studied her, unreadable. "And if I refuse?"

She hadn’t considered that. She’d assumed he’d agree.

If he didn’t... she’d have to tell Gregory the truth.

Evelyn lifted her chin. "I thought you’d say yes. Will you?"

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened. "Fine. But if she tries this again—no matter who she is—there won’t be another chance."

"Deal."

She nodded quickly.

Then Nathaniel added, "On one condition."

"What?"

"If I let Danielle go, you keep your distance from Gregory." Dressed in his sharp black suit, Nathaniel looked every inch the ruthless CEO. His lips curled. "After today, can’t you see he’s playing games?"

Evelyn lowered her gaze, silent.

Nathaniel tilted her chin up, forcing her to meet his eyes. "I mean it, Evelyn. Gregory isn’t who you think he is. He has ulterior motives."



###Chapter 273

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples as she studied the blueprints spread before her. The project deadline loomed closer, and every minute counted.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in with a tray of coffee. "Thought you could use this," she said, setting it down carefully.

Evelyn smiled gratefully. "You're a lifesaver."

Gabrielle hesitated. "Mr. Wilson called earlier. He said the client wants to move up the presentation by two days."

Evelyn's grip tightened around her pen. "Two days? That's impossible."

Gabrielle winced. "He said they're willing to pay extra for the rush."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Of course they were. Money solved everything—except for the fact that she hadn't slept properly in days.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel: Dinner tonight?

She bit her lip. Between the project and the growing tension between them, she wasn't sure she had the energy. But ignoring him would only make things worse.

I'll try, she typed back.

Gabrielle cleared her throat. "There's one more thing."

Evelyn braced herself. "What?"

"Ms. Davis called. She wants to meet with you."

Evelyn's stomach twisted. Isabella. Nathaniel's ex. The woman who had reappeared out of nowhere, stirring up old memories and new insecurities.

"Why?" Evelyn asked, though she already knew the answer.

Gabrielle shrugged. "She didn't say. Just that it was important."

Evelyn stared at her coffee, the steam curling into the air. Important. Right.

She had a sinking feeling that whatever Isabella wanted, it wasn't good.

And she wasn't sure she was ready to face it.

Gregory's treatment of Danielle today felt like shards of glass piercing Evelyn's chest.

She refused to believe Nathaniel would deliberately smear Gregory's reputation, nor did she suspect Nathaniel was manipulating her to limit contact with Gregory. After turning these thoughts over in her mind, she couldn't find any justification to stop obsessing over Gregory's motives.

Her hesitation stretched too long. Nathaniel's gaze darkened, his voice dropping to a dangerous timbre. "Evelyn, answer me. Will you agree to this?"

"Yes," she murmured, knowing full well that regardless of the reason, maintaining distance was necessary.

She'd adhered to this principle since marrying Nathaniel. She wouldn't break any rules of their marital agreement.

More crucially, Danielle had arrived in Mayby. Keeping away from Gregory was as much for her own protection as anything else.

Danielle wasn't released until late afternoon the following day.

Her mood was foul. Gregory ushered her into his car and drove straight to his penthouse.

The ride passed in suffocating silence. Upon entering, Gregory commanded, "Shower first. I'll prepare dinner."

His cold demeanor grated on Danielle's nerves, and the humiliation of spending a night in custody erupted within her.

"Gregory, do you despise me now? Is my presence so unbearable? If that's true, why agree to let me come to Mayby? You could've refused! You could've told our parents not to let me follow you! Why this sudden iciness?"

Her voice climbed hysterically. Gregory clenched his jaw, suppressing his irritation for the sake of her fragile mental state.

His brow furrowed as he pinned her with a stern look. "Danielle, that's not what this is. If I truly wanted rid of you, would I have convinced Evelyn not to press charges? Do you think you'd be standing here shouting at me otherwise? Evelyn's husband is Nathaniel Martin. He wanted you behind bars. Does that sound like someone who doesn't care?"

Danielle's anger deflated.

Guilt washed over her.

"I'm sorry," she whispered, fingers twisting together. "I never meant for this to happen. But seeing you with Evelyn... it makes my blood boil."

"Enough. Clean up and eat. You need rest. We'll discuss this tomorrow."

Tears streaked Danielle's face as an inexplicable dread coiled in her stomach.

After showering, she picked at her meal before accepting the warm milk Gregory offered. Within minutes, drowsiness overtook her.

Gregory guided her to bed. As he turned to leave, her hand shot out, clutching his wrist. "Promise me," she slurred, eyelids heavy, "promise you'll never abandon me."

Gregory's expression remained unreadable. He waited until her breathing evened out before extracting himself from her grasp.

On the balcony, cigarette smoke curled around Gregory as he dialed a familiar number. "Meet me at the café below headquarters tomorrow morning."

The woman's voice crackled with surprise through the receiver. "What's happened?"

His grip tightened on the phone. "Evelyn's pregnant. Are you truly content to let Nathaniel have his way?"

A bitter laugh answered him. "Don't play naive. What choice do I have when you refuse to act against Evelyn? She's expendable for our purposes. Unless..." Her tone turned sly, "unless she means more to you than you've admitted?"

The deliberate provocation hung between them like a challenge.
###Chapter 274

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, she felt the weight of countless eyes upon her. The air was thick with tension, a stark contrast to the elegant chandeliers and lavish décor.

Nathaniel stood by the fireplace, his expression unreadable. The flickering flames cast shadows across his chiseled features, making him look even more imposing than usual.

"Evelyn," he said, his voice low but carrying across the room. "We need to talk."

She swallowed hard, her fingers tightening around the strap of her purse. "About what?"

His gaze darkened. "You know exactly what."

Isabella chose that moment to make her entrance, gliding into the room with effortless grace. Her crimson dress clung to her curves, and her lips curled into a knowing smile as she glanced between them.

"Am I interrupting something?" she purred, her voice dripping with false innocence.

Evelyn forced a polite smile, though her nails dug into her palms. "Not at all."

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. "Isabella, this doesn't concern you."

"Oh, but I think it does," she countered, stepping closer. "After all, we have history, don't we?"

The tension in the room spiked. Evelyn's chest tightened, but she refused to back down. "If you'll excuse me, I have work to attend to."

She turned on her heel, but Nathaniel's voice stopped her. "Evelyn. Don't walk away."

She hesitated, then faced him again. "Then say what you need to say."

His eyes bore into hers, intense and unyielding. "Not here."

Isabella let out a soft laugh. "How dramatic. Fine, I'll leave you two to your little chat." She sauntered away, but not before casting one last smug glance over her shoulder.

Once they were alone, Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "We can't keep doing this."

"Doing what?" Evelyn challenged.

"Pretending everything is fine when it's not."

She crossed her arms. "Then what do you suggest?"

He stepped closer, his presence overwhelming. "We fight for us. No more secrets, no more games."

Evelyn's breath hitched. For a moment, she allowed herself to hope. But then reality crashed back in. "It's not that simple."

"Then make it simple," he demanded.

Before she could respond, the doors burst open, and Gregory stormed in, his face flushed with anger. "Evelyn, we have a problem."

She blinked. "What?"

"The Summit Realty deal—it's falling apart. Jonathan just called. They're pulling out."

Her stomach dropped. "What? Why?"

Gregory's gaze flicked to Nathaniel before settling back on her. "Because Sebastian Wilson just made them a better offer."

Nathaniel's expression turned thunderous. "That bastard."

Evelyn's mind raced. This couldn't be happening. Not now.

Gregory gripped her shoulder. "We need to act fast."

She nodded, steeling herself. "Let's go."

As she turned to leave, Nathaniel caught her wrist. "Evelyn."

She met his eyes, seeing the storm of emotions within them.

"We'll talk later," she promised, pulling free.

But as she walked away, she couldn't shake the feeling that everything was unraveling—and she had no idea how to stop it.

Gregory understood her implication without missing a beat. "Evelyn is on a completely different path from our objectives, so comparing her to us is pointless. As for her and Nathaniel, I certainly don’t wish to see anything good come of it."

"Good."

"Let’s discuss this further in person," Gregory said, his eyes narrowing slightly. He ended the call and immediately deleted the record.

The next morning, Evelyn arrived at the construction site. After her recent abduction, Daniel had been horrified. He’d installed surveillance cameras in every corner and public space, some visible, others so well-hidden even he sometimes forgot their locations. To ensure extra security, he’d implemented a backup system in case of tampering.

He’d also prepared a detailed map of all the hidden cameras for Evelyn.

"Evelyn, I failed to keep you safe. I’m truly sorry," Daniel said, guilt weighing heavily in his voice.

Evelyn shook her head. "Daniel, this wasn’t your fault. I should’ve been more cautious. Did Nathaniel say something to you?"

"No, of course not. This is just my own reflection."

Evelyn smiled slightly, relieved that Nathaniel hadn’t interfered.

Daniel handed her the marked-up blueprint. "This shows every surveillance point on-site. Some feeds aren’t even connected to the main system to prevent sabotage. Your recent caution made me realize how vulnerable we are. If anything happens, you can access the footage immediately. Though, of course, I hope nothing does."

Evelyn skimmed the map, amused. "Being careful is one thing, but this is borderline excessive."

Little did she know, Daniel’s thoroughness would soon save her from a life-threatening situation.

After reviewing the site and handing Daniel the revised garden layout, Evelyn called for a ride back to the office.

But the moment she stepped inside, the atmosphere was thick with tension.

Frowning, she caught Gabrielle’s eye. Her assistant quickly followed her into the office and shut the door.

"What happened?" Evelyn asked.

Gabrielle hesitated before speaking in a hushed tone. "Mr. Wilson’s sister just stormed in. She was furious—yelling at everyone, accusing us of seducing Mr. Wilson behind her back. Then she said…"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Said what?"

Gabrielle swallowed hard. "She called Mr. Wilson a stray dog the Wilsons took in, saying he belongs to her and shouldn’t get close to other women. She threatened to report him to their parents if he disobeyed."

Evelyn’s pulse stuttered. She remained silent, but Gabrielle couldn’t hold back.

"Ms. Mitchell… is it true? Was Mr. Wilson really adopted?"

Evelyn fixed her with a chilling look. "Curiosity killed the cat, Gabrielle."

Gabrielle clamped her mouth shut, suddenly terrified.

Evelyn’s lips twitched in amusement. "Go back to work. And make sure no one spreads rumors. Act like you heard nothing."
###Chapter 275

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She traced the outline of his jaw with her fingertips, marveling at how peaceful he looked.

A soft knock interrupted the moment.

"Mrs. Martin?" Alfred's voice was muffled through the door. "Mr. Edward has requested your presence in the study."

Evelyn sighed. She had hoped for a quiet morning, but it seemed her grandfather-in-law had other plans.

"Tell him I'll be there shortly," she replied, careful not to wake Nathaniel.

She slipped out of bed and dressed quickly, choosing a simple yet elegant navy dress. The house was unusually quiet as she made her way to Edward's study.

The door was slightly ajar. She knocked lightly before entering.

Edward sat behind his massive oak desk, his expression unreadable. "Ah, Evelyn. Come in."

She took a seat across from him, folding her hands in her lap. "You wanted to see me?"

He studied her for a long moment before speaking. "I've been reviewing the latest reports from the Summit Realty project. Your designs have garnered significant attention."

Evelyn blinked. "That's... good news, isn't it?"

Edward leaned forward, his piercing gaze locking onto hers. "It is. But success comes with scrutiny. There are those who would rather see you fail."

A chill ran down her spine. "What do you mean?"

Before he could answer, the door burst open. Nathaniel strode in, his expression dark. "Grandfather, we need to talk."

Edward raised an eyebrow. "About?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Isabella is back in town. And she's already making moves."

Evelyn's stomach twisted. Isabella—Nathaniel's ex, the woman who had nearly destroyed their relationship before.

Edward sighed. "I see. And what does she want?"

Nathaniel's eyes flicked to Evelyn before returning to his grandfather. "She claims to have information that could damage the family. Specifically, Evelyn."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "Me? What could she possibly have on me?"

Nathaniel shook his head. "I don't know yet. But I intend to find out."

Edward steepled his fingers. "Be careful, Nathaniel. Isabella is not to be underestimated."

Nathaniel nodded grimly. "I know."

Evelyn stood abruptly. "I won't sit back and let her manipulate us again. If she's coming after me, I'll face her head-on."

Nathaniel reached for her hand. "We'll handle this together."

Edward watched them, a faint smile tugging at his lips. "Good. Unity is our strength."

As Evelyn and Nathaniel left the study, she couldn't shake the unease settling in her chest. Isabella's return was no coincidence. And whatever game she was playing, Evelyn refused to be a pawn.

The battle lines had been drawn. And this time, she was ready to fight.

Gabrielle nodded, her curiosity growing with each passing second. Recalling Evelyn's instructions, she suspected there might be some truth to them.

The realization hit her like a well-kept secret—one she couldn’t share.

Evelyn stood silently in the office for a moment before stepping out and knocking on Gregory’s door.

The moment he saw her, Gregory forced a smile. "Is everything running smoothly at the construction site?"

"Yes, no issues so far."

Evelyn studied him closely. His smile didn’t reach his eyes, and his usual warmth was replaced by a subdued melancholy.

She tilted her head. "Did Danielle come by again?"

The last traces of his smile vanished. His voice was quiet. "Yes. She accused me of seeing someone else. It… upset her."

"That woman from the café last time?"

Evelyn had only caught a glimpse of her retreating figure that day.

Gregory nodded. "Do you think it’s because of my background that she feels she can treat me this way?"

Evelyn’s brows drew together. "Absolutely not. You’re equals. The Wilsons may have taken you in, but you’ve given them just as much in return—if not more."

He owed them nothing. If anything, their relationship had been mutually beneficial.

Though adopted into the Wilson family, Gregory had devoted himself to their business since his teenage years. Yet, they’d always viewed him with suspicion, fearing he might usurp their legacy. That was why he’d sought refuge in Mayby alongside Evelyn.

Gregory exhaled, a faint, humorless smile touching his lips. "Evelyn, I understand the weight of their kindness. But Danielle—someone I’ve always treated like a sister—called me a stray dog. That’s how they see me. Maybe they always have."

He had been Danielle’s constant protector since childhood. Before Mayby, she’d clung to him like a shadow, relying on him for everything. And now? This was his reward—being reduced to nothing more than an adopted mutt.

A cold smirk twisted his lips, his expression darkening further.

Evelyn frowned, lowering her voice. "Gregory, that’s not true. She was probably just overwhelmed. Maybe she cares too much about you. She—"

The more she spoke, the more something felt off. She trailed off abruptly.

Gregory lifted his gaze. "What is it?"

"Does she have feelings for you? Is that why she can’t stand other women near you?"

The pieces clicked into place. It explained Danielle’s hostility toward her—the glares, the sharp words.

Evelyn glanced at Gregory. His lack of surprise told her everything.

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "You knew?"

"Yes. She’s confessed a few times. I dismissed it as childish infatuation. I thought she’d outgrow it."

"Did you ever reject her? If you don’t feel the same, you should’ve made it clear. Otherwise, she’ll keep hoping."

Evelyn didn’t press further. This was his personal matter, and as a friend, she could only offer a gentle reminder.

But one question lingered in her mind: How did Danielle find out about the woman from the café?

Did he let it slip on purpose?



###Chapter 276

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. The warmth of Nathaniel’s arm draped over her waist was comforting, a silent reminder of the love they had fought so hard to protect. She turned slightly, studying his peaceful expression—the sharp lines of his jaw softened in sleep, the faintest hint of a smile playing at his lips.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand, breaking the quiet. A message from Gregory flashed on the screen: "Emergency meeting at the office. We need you here ASAP."

Evelyn sighed, carefully untangling herself from Nathaniel’s embrace. He murmured something unintelligible but didn’t wake. She pressed a light kiss to his forehead before slipping out of bed.

Downstairs, Alfred had already prepared her usual coffee—black with a hint of cinnamon. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted, handing her the cup. "Shall I inform Mr. Martin of your early departure?"

"No, let him sleep," she said, taking a grateful sip. "He had a late night."

The drive to her firm was brisk, the city streets still quiet at this hour. But the moment she stepped into the conference room, the tension was palpable. Gregory stood by the window, his expression grim, while Gabrielle paced nervously near the whiteboard.

"What’s going on?" Evelyn asked, setting her bag down.

Gregory turned, his jaw tight. "Summit Realty just pulled out of the Riverside project. Sebastian Wilson called me personally—said they’re taking their investment elsewhere."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. That project was their biggest contract this year. "Did he give a reason?"

Gabrielle shook her head. "Only that they’ve found a ‘more suitable’ partner. But I did some digging—rumor has it Isabella Davis is behind this."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her coffee cup. Isabella. Nathaniel’s ex. The woman who had made it her mission to sabotage Evelyn at every turn.

Gregory exhaled sharply. "We have two weeks before the deadline. If we don’t secure another investor, we lose everything."

Evelyn’s mind raced. She couldn’t let this happen. Not after all the work they’d put in. Not when so much was at stake.

"I’ll handle it," she said, her voice steady despite the storm inside her.

Gabrielle frowned. "How?"

Evelyn met her gaze, determination burning in her eyes. "I have a few connections of my own."

As she strode out of the room, her phone buzzed again—this time, a message from an unknown number.

"You should know when to walk away, Evelyn. Some battles aren’t worth fighting."

Her grip on the phone tightened. Oh, this was far from over.

Isabella had just made this personal.

Evelyn's gaze sharpened slightly as she studied Gregory with an inscrutable expression.

Unbidden, Nathaniel's words echoed in her mind. A flood of questions surged within her.

Did Gregory intentionally make Danielle mess up?

The thought seemed absurd, yet the seed of doubt took root, twisting uncomfortably in her chest.

Evelyn said nothing more, only offering Gregory a quiet reassurance before leaving his office.

Just as she stepped out, her phone buzzed—Nathaniel's name flashed across the screen.

"I'll pick you up later," his deep voice came through. "Dinner at the Martin estate tonight. Alright?"

"Fine."

"What are you doing now?"

"Working."

She didn’t understand why he was asking.

Nathaniel merely hummed in response before the line fell silent.

Meanwhile, Isabella stood outside the Martin Corporation building, her heels clicking impatiently against the marble steps. The receptionist had already denied her entry—no appointment, no meeting.

Frustrated, she dialed Samuel instead.

Samuel hesitated. He wasn’t sure what Nathaniel was planning, so he cautiously stepped into the office.

Nathaniel was still on the phone, but his sharp eyes flicked up, silently demanding an explanation.

"What is it?" Nathaniel asked coolly.

Samuel swallowed. "Sir, Ms. Davis is downstairs. She insists on seeing you."

A shadow crossed Nathaniel’s face. Then, Evelyn’s voice, icy and detached, drifted through the phone.

"I’ll leave you to it."

The call ended abruptly.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. His glare could have frozen hell over.

Samuel wilted under the weight of it. He told me to speak!

But he wisely kept his head down.

Nathaniel tossed his phone onto the desk. "Bring her up."

His fingers tapped restlessly against the armrest before he snatched his phone again, typing out a quick message:

[I had no idea she was coming.]

Evelyn read it. Then, with deliberate calm, she set her phone aside and picked up a file.

Her eyes skimmed the words, but none of them registered.

Annoyance prickled under her skin. She didn’t want to hear Isabella’s name—not from Nathaniel, not from anyone.

That was all.

Yes. That’s all it is.

She exhaled sharply, propping her chin on her hand as her thoughts spiraled.

Nathaniel waited. No reply came.

His thumb brushed over the screen once, twice, before Samuel returned with Isabella in tow.

This was the first time Isabella had faced Nathaniel since learning of Evelyn’s pregnancy.

Her fingers curled around her purse strap, knuckles whitening. She stood rigid, lips pressed into a thin line.

Samuel slipped out silently.

Nathaniel didn’t offer her a seat. "What do you want?"

His indifference stung.

Isabella inhaled shakily. "Nathaniel, I need to ask you something. And I want the truth."

His brow arched. "Go on."

She met his eyes, unwavering. "Are you staying married to Evelyn only because she’s pregnant? Not because you love her?"

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "Why does it matter?"

"Because it does!" Her voice cracked. "To me, it matters. So tell me—you don’t love her. You’re just staying for the baby. Right?"

Nathaniel leaned back, his gaze glacial. "Isabella, whether I love Evelyn or not—does it change anything for you?"

She flinched.

His next words were merciless. "The only answer you need is this: My children will only ever be Evelyn’s."

###Chapter 277

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Evelyn stirred awake. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady and calm. She traced the contours of his face with her gaze, marveling at how peaceful he looked.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she whispered.

Alfred, their butler, entered with a tray of coffee and fresh pastries. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin. I thought you might appreciate an early breakfast before your meeting."

Evelyn smiled gratefully. "Thank you, Alfred. You always know what I need."

As she sipped her coffee, her phone buzzed. A message from Gregory flashed on the screen: "Emergency meeting at the office. We need to discuss the Summit Realty project ASAP."

Her stomach tightened. The Summit Realty deal had been nothing but trouble from the start. Sebastian Wilson, the company’s CEO, had been pushing unreasonable demands, and Jonathan Blake, their project manager, was equally difficult to work with.

Nathaniel stirred, his eyes fluttering open. "Morning," he murmured, voice rough with sleep.

Evelyn leaned down to press a kiss to his forehead. "Morning. Gregory just texted—there’s an issue with Summit Realty. I need to head in early."

Nathaniel frowned, sitting up. "Again? What now?"

She sighed. "I don’t know yet, but I have a feeling it’s not good."

He reached for her hand, squeezing it gently. "Let me know if you need me to step in."

Evelyn nodded, though she knew she wouldn’t ask. This was her project, her responsibility. She had to handle it herself.

The office was already buzzing when she arrived. Gabrielle, her assistant, rushed over the moment she stepped through the door.

"Gregory’s in the conference room with the Summit team. They’re… not happy," Gabrielle said in a hushed tone.

Evelyn squared her shoulders. "Then let’s go make them happy."

Inside the conference room, Gregory was locked in a heated discussion with Jonathan. Sebastian lounged in his chair, watching with an amused smirk.

Evelyn cleared her throat. "Gentlemen, I hear we have a problem."

Sebastian’s smirk widened. "Ah, Evelyn. Just the woman we’ve been waiting for."

She ignored the condescension in his tone. "What’s the issue?"

Jonathan slid a folder across the table. "Your latest designs don’t meet our specifications. We need revisions—immediately."

Evelyn flipped through the documents, her jaw tightening. These weren’t minor adjustments—they were complete redesigns.

Gregory shot her a warning look, but she wasn’t backing down. "These changes weren’t part of our original agreement. If you want them, we’ll need to renegotiate the timeline and budget."

Sebastian chuckled. "Or you could just do your job and deliver what we’re paying for."

The air in the room turned icy.

Evelyn met his gaze head-on. "We are doing our job. But if you keep moving the goalposts, we can’t be held responsible for the delays."

Silence stretched between them. Then, to her surprise, Sebastian leaned back, his smirk fading. "Fine. Let’s talk numbers."

As the meeting continued, Evelyn couldn’t shake the feeling that this was far from over.

And she was right.

Because as she left the conference room, her phone buzzed again—this time with a message from an unknown number:

"You should walk away from this deal, Evelyn. For your own good."

Her blood ran cold.

Who was warning her?

And why?

Isabella's eyes widened in shock as she whispered, "It's your family's influence making you think like this, isn't it?"

Nathaniel's voice was icy. "Isabella, I won't tolerate you chipping away at what little guilt I have left. You know this. Once it's gone, so are we. I won't lie—I did consider marrying you after you woke up. But that changed when you kept pushing."

His words were sharp, deliberate. Isabella froze, her breath catching in her throat.

Nathaniel watched her, his gaze unreadable. "So choose wisely."

It was a warning. A clear one. Evelyn was pregnant now. If anything happened to her or the baby, whatever remained between them would vanish.

Isabella bit her lip, struggling to keep her emotions in check. She clenched her hands until her knuckles turned white. One wrong word, and she’d lose him completely.

After a long silence, she forced a smile. "Nathaniel, I understand. You don’t have to worry. I won’t disappoint you." She took a shaky breath. "Actually, I came to tell you—I’ve made my decision. Let’s sign the contract."

She was agreeing to let the Martin Group take full control of her career, leveraging their resources to push her forward.

Nathaniel arched a brow. "You’re sure?"

"Yes." Her voice was steady, though her eyes glistened. "I’ll focus on my work. I won’t rely on you anymore."

The smile she gave him was fragile, her heart breaking behind it.

Nathaniel didn’t respond. Instead, he gestured to Samuel, who swiftly printed the contract. With a few strokes of his pen, Nathaniel sealed the deal—Isabella was now under the Martin Group’s entertainment division.

Though their film and entertainment branch was relatively new, the Martin name guaranteed prestige. For Isabella, this was the best path forward.

Tucking the contract into her bag, she left without another word.

The moment she stepped outside, she dialed Vanessa, her manager. "Dissolve the studio," she ordered, her voice low. "From now on, everything goes through the Martins."

Her grip on the phone tightened, her nails digging into her palm. This wasn’t over. Evelyn had ruined everything. And Isabella wouldn’t let that slide.

Back in the office, Nathaniel turned to Samuel. "Have Vanessa brought in. Make sure she understands the rules."

Samuel nodded. If Vanessa resisted, she’d be replaced. Simple as that.

By evening, Nathaniel was driving Evelyn back to Martin Manor, his thoughts already shifting to the future—one where Isabella was no longer a threat.



###Chapter 278

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her blueprints. She adjusted her glasses, her fingers tracing the intricate lines of her latest design. The project was ambitious—a fusion of modern minimalism and classic elegance, something she knew Nathaniel would appreciate.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Come in," she called, not looking up.

Gabrielle, her assistant, stepped inside, holding a steaming cup of coffee. "Thought you might need this," she said, placing it on the desk. "You've been at it since dawn."

Evelyn smiled gratefully, wrapping her hands around the warm mug. "Thanks. Just trying to perfect the final details before presenting it to the board."

Gabrielle hesitated, then added, "Mr. Martin called earlier. He said he’d be late for dinner tonight."

Evelyn’s grip tightened slightly around the cup. "Again?"

Gabrielle nodded sympathetically. "Something about an urgent meeting with Summit Realty."

Evelyn exhaled, forcing a smile. "Right. Of course."

She turned back to her work, but her focus had already splintered. Nathaniel had been distant lately, buried under the weight of his family’s expectations and the relentless demands of the Martin Group. She understood—she really did—but that didn’t make the loneliness any easier.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Charlotte:

"Girls’ night. My place. Wine and bad movies. You in?"

Evelyn chuckled, typing back: "Desperately needed. See you at 8."

She leaned back in her chair, staring at the ceiling. Maybe a night away from the suffocating silence of their penthouse was exactly what she needed.

Meanwhile, across town, Nathaniel sat in a dimly lit conference room, his jaw clenched as Edward Martin—his grandfather—laid out the terms of their latest acquisition.

"This isn’t just business, Nathaniel," Edward said, his voice sharp. "This is about legacy. About securing the future of this family."

Nathaniel’s fingers tapped impatiently against the table. "I understand that. But pushing this deal through without proper due diligence is reckless."

Edward’s eyes narrowed. "Since when did you become so cautious?"

Nathaniel met his gaze evenly. "Since I realized not everything can be bought with the Martin name."

A tense silence settled over the room.

Samuel Yates, Nathaniel’s secretary, cleared his throat. "Perhaps we should reconvene after reviewing the latest reports?"

Edward waved a dismissive hand. "Fine. But don’t take too long. Time isn’t on our side."

As the meeting adjourned, Nathaniel loosened his tie, frustration simmering beneath his skin. He pulled out his phone, thumb hovering over Evelyn’s contact. He wanted to call her, to hear her voice, but what would he even say?

"Sorry I’ve been absent. Sorry I keep choosing this empire over us."

With a sigh, he pocketed his phone.

Some things couldn’t be fixed with words.

Back at the office, Evelyn packed up her things, her mind already drifting to the comfort of Charlotte’s couch and the promise of mindless laughter.

But as she stepped into the elevator, her phone rang.

Unknown number.

She hesitated, then answered.

"Evelyn Mitchell?" A woman’s voice, smooth and unfamiliar.

"Yes?"

A pause. Then:

"I think we should talk. It’s about Nathaniel."

Evelyn’s breath caught.

The elevator doors slid shut.

The afternoon sun cast golden hues through the grand windows of Martin Manor as Evelyn stepped inside for the first time since her pregnancy had been announced. Victoria had instructed the staff to prepare an elaborate spread of Evelyn's favorite dishes, each carefully selected to suit her current condition.

At dinner, Edward produced a document—meticulously drafted by his lawyers earlier that day—and slid it across the table toward Evelyn. His eyes twinkled with warmth. "This is for you and the baby. I meant to give it to you when you married Nathaniel, but you refused then. This time, I won't take no for an answer."

It was an equity transfer agreement. Edward was gifting Evelyn and her unborn child two percent of his personal shares in Martin Group.

Two percent.

Enough to secure her a seat on the board—more than Nathaniel had held when he first joined the company.

Evelyn's breath caught.

Her fingers hovered over the document before she withdrew them. "Grandfather, I can't accept this."

Edward's expression turned firm. "It's yours, Evelyn. Take it."

Richard and Victoria nodded in agreement. "You're family now," Richard said gently. "There's no need to stand on ceremony."

Evelyn's chest tightened.

Accepting these shares would bind her even more tightly to Nathaniel—something she had deliberately avoided when they married. She had never wanted their relationship to be anchored by financial ties.

Her lips pressed together, hesitation flickering in her eyes.

Nathaniel noticed her silence. With a quiet exhale, he reached over and took the document. "I'll hold onto it for now," he said smoothly. "She can sign it when she's ready. Unless you'd rather keep a pregnant woman up all night debating legal paperwork?"

Edward chuckled, the tension dissolving. "Fine, you keep it. But remember—this is for Evelyn and the baby, not you."

Nathaniel arched a brow. "Afraid I'll steal it?"

"Wouldn't put it past you," Edward retorted, grinning.

The mood lightened, and Victoria turned her attention back to Evelyn, noting which dishes she favored and which she barely touched. Pregnancy came with unpredictable cravings and aversions—something Victoria understood well.

After dinner, Victoria hesitated before speaking. "Evelyn, you've lost weight. You're eating for two now—you mustn't neglect your nutrition. Should I arrange for a personal chef to assist you?"

Evelyn instinctively glanced at Nathaniel.

He caught her look and answered for them. "We'll hire someone. You and Grandfather are accustomed to the staff here—keep them."

Victoria relented, though she added, "Just make sure you find someone skilled—and trustworthy."

"Understood," Nathaniel said.

As they prepared to leave, Victoria hesitated again. "Evelyn, I ran into your mother today. I didn’t realize you hadn’t told the Mitchells about the pregnancy. I invited her to dinner and… well, it slipped out. She seemed upset. Perhaps you should call her later?"

Guilt flickered across Victoria's face. She had considered calling Evelyn immediately but decided to wait until tonight.

"I'm sorry," Victoria added softly. "I shouldn’t have said anything without asking you first."

Evelyn's stomach dropped.

She had been avoiding this conversation.

Now, she had no choice.
###Chapter 279

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples as she reviewed the latest blueprints for the Martin Group's new resort project. The weight of responsibility pressed heavily on her shoulders—not just as an architect, but as Nathaniel's wife.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Come in," she called, straightening her posture.

The door swung open to reveal Gabrielle, her assistant, holding a steaming cup of coffee. "Thought you might need this," Gabrielle said with a knowing smile. "You've been staring at those plans for hours."

Evelyn accepted the cup gratefully, the rich aroma momentarily soothing her nerves. "Thanks. I just want everything to be perfect."

Gabrielle hesitated before speaking again. "Mr. Wilson called. He said the client wants to move up the deadline."

Evelyn's grip tightened around the cup. "By how much?"

"Two weeks."

She exhaled sharply. That was nearly impossible. But backing down wasn't an option—not when Nathaniel had entrusted her with this project.

"I'll handle it," she said, forcing confidence into her voice.

As Gabrielle left, Evelyn's phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel lit up the screen:

"Dinner tonight? Just the two of us."

A small smile tugged at her lips. Despite the chaos, he always found ways to remind her she wasn't alone.

But before she could reply, another notification popped up—an email from an unknown sender. The subject line sent a chill down her spine:

"You don't belong in his world."

Her breath hitched. Was this another threat? Another attempt to shake her confidence?

Evelyn's fingers hovered over the delete button, but curiosity won. She opened it.

The message was brief, but the words cut deep:

"He'll never love you the way he loved her."

Her stomach twisted. Her. Isabella.

The past was supposed to stay buried. So why did it keep resurfacing?

Evelyn closed the email, her hands trembling. She wouldn't let this rattle her. She couldn't.

But as she turned back to her blueprints, the shadows in the room seemed darker, the silence heavier.

And for the first time in months, doubt crept in.

Was she truly enough for Nathaniel?

Or was she just living in someone else's shadow?

"Victoria, what are you saying? There's no need to apologize." Evelyn smiled warmly, brushing it off without a second thought. "It's really nothing. You didn't do anything wrong."

"You truly don't blame me?"

"Of course not!"

Evelyn took Victoria's hand, her voice soft and reassuring. "Please, don't dwell on it. It's not worth worrying about."

"Evelyn, you're so kind. You really are the most understanding and considerate woman I know."

The compliment made Evelyn blush slightly, unused to such open praise.

The three men watching their exchange exchanged puzzled glances. One moment, Victoria was apologizing, and the next, she was showering Evelyn with compliments. The intricacies of women's conversations remained a mystery to them.

After their chat, Nathaniel drove Evelyn back to their apartment.

He had placed the equity transfer documents from Edward in the car earlier. As he navigated the streets, he glanced at her. "Why won’t you accept what Grandfather gave you?"

"I just think it’s too much."

"Really?"

"Of course. What other reason would there be?"

Nathaniel gave her a knowing look, one that made Evelyn shift slightly in her seat. But he didn’t press further, turning his attention back to the road.

"I’ll have Samuel prepare a list of potential household staff for you to choose from tomorrow," he said gently.

"Alright."

Evelyn had no objections. Most of their meals were taken with Beatrice now, given her frail health. But with her pregnancy, Evelyn needed to pay closer attention to her diet—nutrients, balance, everything. She had to start thinking about herself.

The next morning, Samuel arrived with three candidates. After careful consideration, Evelyn chose Rosalind, a warm-faced woman skilled in diverse cuisines. By noon, Rosalind had prepared a meal for them to sample.

Her cooking was exceptional, earning nods of approval from both Evelyn and Nathaniel. The decision was made on the spot.

Rosalind’s duties were clear—three meals a day, nothing more. She wouldn’t overstay, ensuring they still had their privacy.

But that privacy was short-lived.

A call from Margaret shattered the calm.

Her voice was sharp, laced with barely restrained emotion. "Evelyn, is it true? Are you pregnant?"

Evelyn remained silent.

Margaret took it as confirmation.

"What is the meaning of this?" she demanded. "You hid it from us. If Victoria hadn’t mentioned it, would we have ever known? Do I even matter to you anymore? Does this family?"

The humiliation burned. The other women’s shocked expressions when Victoria casually dropped the news—how they’d looked at Margaret, as if she were some neglectful mother who couldn’t even keep track of her own daughter’s life.

She hadn’t slept all night. And yet, Evelyn hadn’t reached out. Not a single call. Surely Victoria must have said something by now.

But Evelyn’s response was calm, almost detached.

"I assumed you wouldn’t be interested," she said simply. "It didn’t seem important enough to bring up."
###Chapter 280

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the design—a new eco-friendly residential complex for Martin Group. The project was her pride, a testament to her skills as an architect.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

"Evelyn?" Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn straightened, smoothing her blouse. "Send him in."

Gregory Wilson strode in, his usual confident demeanor slightly off. His tie was loosened, and his expression carried an uncharacteristic tension.

"You look like you've seen a ghost," Evelyn remarked, raising a brow.

Gregory exhaled sharply. "Close enough. I just got off the phone with Summit Realty. They're pushing for an earlier deadline."

Evelyn frowned. "That's impossible. We haven't even finalized the structural adjustments."

"I know." He ran a hand through his hair. "But Sebastian Wilson is adamant. He claims Martin Group wants it done sooner."

Evelyn's grip tightened on her pen. "Nathaniel didn't mention anything."

Gregory hesitated. "That's the thing. I called Samuel Yates to confirm, and he said Nathaniel hasn't approved any changes."

A cold suspicion settled in her chest. "So Sebastian is making demands without authorization?"

"Seems like it." Gregory leaned against her desk. "What do you want to do?"

Evelyn tapped her fingers against the blueprint. "We stick to the original timeline. If Summit Realty has an issue, they can take it up with Nathaniel directly."

Gregory nodded, relief flickering in his eyes. "Good. I'll handle the pushback."

As he turned to leave, Evelyn added, "And Gregory? Keep this between us for now. I want to talk to Nathaniel first."

"Understood."

The moment the door closed, Evelyn reached for her phone. Before she could dial, it buzzed with an incoming message.

Unknown Number: You should ask your husband about his meeting with Isabella Davis last night.

Her breath hitched. Isabella—Nathaniel's ex. The woman who had once torn them apart.

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly as she typed back.

Evelyn: Who is this?

The reply came instantly.

Unknown Number: A friend. Or maybe a warning.

A chill ran down her spine.

The office suddenly felt too small, the walls closing in. She needed air.

Grabbing her blazer, Evelyn strode out, ignoring Gabrielle's questioning look.

She had to find Nathaniel.

Now.

The elevator doors slid open on the executive floor of Martin Group. Evelyn marched past startled assistants, her heels clicking sharply against the marble.

Samuel Yates stood abruptly from his desk. "Mrs. Martin—"

"Where is he?" she demanded.

Samuel hesitated. "In a meeting with—"

She didn't wait for the rest. Pushing past him, she flung open the conference room doors.

Nathaniel looked up, surprise flashing across his face. Around the table, several executives gaped at the interruption.

And there, seated beside him—Isabella Davis.

Dressed in a sleek black dress, her lips curved into a knowing smile.

"Evelyn," Nathaniel said, standing. "What's wrong?"

Her pulse roared in her ears.

"We need to talk."

Evelyn had always known she was replaceable to Margaret or the Mitchell family.

After marrying Nathaniel, the rest of the Martins—except Margaret—had softened slightly toward her, but only in person. Behind closed doors? She doubted any of them truly cared.

Margaret, however, remained as cold as ever. If anything, she treated Evelyn worse than a stranger.

Hearing Evelyn's confirmation, Margaret fell silent for a moment before repeating, "You're really pregnant?"

Evelyn's brows knitted together. "Why call if you don’t believe me?"

"Evelyn, if it's true, why didn’t you tell me? Are you at home or work? Your father and I will come see you."

The sudden shift in Margaret’s tone stunned Evelyn.

Before she could respond, Margaret pressed on, "You're at home, right? We’ll be there soon. You need more nutrients now—I’ll bring fruit."

The unexpected warmth left Evelyn speechless.

The only thing she could think of was relief that Nathaniel had left for the office after dinner. At least he wouldn’t witness William and Margaret’s sudden visit.

Deep down, she feared this was about the Mitchell Group’s failed partnership with Martin Enterprises.

She prayed she was wrong.

Forty minutes later, William and Margaret arrived. They settled on the couch, scanning the apartment before William remarked coolly, "You’re still living here while pregnant? Shouldn’t Nathaniel or the Martins move you somewhere better?"

"I’m fine here. It’s close to Beatrice."

Evelyn deliberately mentioned her grandmother, but Margaret brushed it off with a frown. "Evelyn, you’re carrying the Martin heir. Use this chance to secure your position—claim what you deserve."

When Evelyn didn’t respond, Margaret nudged William, who quickly added, "Your mother’s right. No more talk of divorce. And didn’t Edward promise you shares once you got pregnant?"

"He did. I refused."

"What?" William’s composure shattered. "Are you out of your mind? Those shares aren’t just yours—they’re the Mitchell family’s! You should’ve consulted me!"

Evelyn’s voice turned icy. "There’s nothing to discuss. The Martins and Mitchells are separate. Their assets aren’t yours to claim."

"You—!" William’s face darkened.

He glared at her. "Then fix this. Get Nathaniel to reinstate the partnership. The Mitchell Group is losing profits because of this."

"So that’s why you came."

Evelyn’s gaze flicked to the fruit basket on the table—their hollow gesture. The hypocrisy was almost laughable.

William’s silence confirmed it.

Margaret, however, smoothed her skirt and said, "Whatever our reasons, we’re thinking of the family. You’re a Mitchell—act like one."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, saying nothing.

The room fell into tense silence.

William finally snapped, "Well? Aren’t you going to answer?"

Evelyn met his glare. "There’s nothing to say. I don’t control Martin Enterprises. If they rejected the partnership, I can’t change that."



###Chapter 281

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. Her fingers flew over the blueprints as she adjusted the final details of the coastal resort project. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint aroma of her jasmine perfume.

"Miss Mitchell?" Gabrielle's voice came through the intercom. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn smoothed her pencil skirt before responding. "Send him in, Gabrielle."

Gregory entered with his usual confident stride, though his usually impeccable tie was slightly askew today. "We've got a situation," he said without preamble, dropping a folder on her desk. "The zoning board is demanding additional environmental impact studies before approving the waterfront development."

Evelyn's brow furrowed as she flipped through the documents. "But we already submitted three separate reports last month." Her fingers tapped rhythmically against the mahogany surface. "This smells like Edward Martin's doing."

Gregory nodded grimly. "Exactly what I thought. His people have been whispering in the commissioners' ears since last week's hearing."

The intercom buzzed again. "Miss Mitchell, Mr. Martin is on line one."

Evelyn and Gregory exchanged glances. Speak of the devil, she thought bitterly. She pressed the speakerphone button. "Nathaniel. To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure?"

His deep voice filled the room, sending an involuntary shiver down her spine despite her irritation. "Evelyn, we need to talk. Face to face. The usual place in thirty minutes?"

She hesitated only a second. "Fine. But this better be good."

As the line went dead, Gregory raised an eyebrow. "You're still meeting him at that café? After everything?"

Evelyn grabbed her leather portfolio, her movements sharp with contained frustration. "It's neutral territory. And right now, I need answers more than I need to nurse old wounds."

The autumn air was crisp as Evelyn stepped out of the office building. Leaves swirled around her ankles as she walked the familiar path to the little French café where she and Nathaniel had shared countless meetings - both professional and personal. The scent of freshly baked croissants greeted her as she pushed open the door.

He was already there, seated at their usual corner table. The sunlight caught the silver streaks in his dark hair as he stood to greet her. Even after all this time, the sight of him still made her breath catch.

"You're looking well," Nathaniel said, his gaze sweeping over her in that way that always made her feel both exposed and cherished.

Evelyn slid into the chair opposite him without returning the compliment. "Cut to the chase, Nathaniel. Why is your grandfather blocking my project?"

His expression darkened. "It's more complicated than that." He reached into his briefcase and slid a photograph across the table. "Do you recognize this man?"

Evelyn studied the image of a middle-aged man with sharp features and cold eyes. Something about him seemed vaguely familiar. "Should I?"

"Jonathan Blake. He's been making inquiries about you at several city departments." Nathaniel's fingers tightened around his coffee cup. "And he's been seen meeting with Isabella multiple times this past week."

The name hit Evelyn like a physical blow. Isabella Davis - Nathaniel's ex-fiancée, the woman who had nearly destroyed their marriage two years ago. "What could she possibly want now?"

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. "That's what I intend to find out. But until we do, you need to be careful. These zoning delays might just be the beginning."

As Evelyn absorbed this information, her phone buzzed with a text from Charlotte: "Emergency girls' night. My place. 8pm. Wine and gossip mandatory."

She sighed, already knowing she wouldn't be able to refuse. Some battles, at least, were predictable.

Nathaniel reached across the table, his fingers brushing hers. "Whatever happens, Evelyn, I won't let anyone hurt you again. Not Isabella, not my grandfather, not anyone."

The warmth of his touch sent conflicting emotions warring within her. She wanted to believe him. Needed to believe him. But the scars of the past ran deep.

As she looked into his determined eyes, Evelyn realized with sudden clarity that this wasn't just about business rivalries or bureaucratic red tape. Something far more dangerous was unfolding around them.

And somehow, she and Nathaniel were right in the center of it.

Nathaniel's voice was calm but firm. "If you speak to me about it, I'll agree. You're carrying my child now. Of course I'll say yes."

Evelyn shook her head, her fingers tightening around her teacup. "I won't use our child as leverage. The Martin Group's decision to terminate the contract with Mitchell Corporation is a business matter. You shouldn’t have come to me—you should be addressing the issues within your own company."

She had already asked Nathaniel, and she knew his decision wasn’t influenced by their divorce. If it had been about her, she would have broached the subject of reinstating the partnership herself.

But since it wasn’t personal, she refused to bring it up—let alone manipulate him with the pregnancy.

Her unwavering stance infuriated both William and Margaret.

What followed was a tense argument, though it was mostly William and Margaret hurling accusations at Evelyn.

Eventually, Beatrice emerged from her room, her sharp gaze sweeping over them. "Is this how you raise your voices in my house?"

The reprimand silenced them. Without another word, William and Margaret stormed out, not even sparing Beatrice a glance.

Evelyn’s chest tightened with frustration and disappointment.

She helped Beatrice sit down, forcing a smile. "Don’t let them upset you, Grandmother. They’re just—"

"Worried I’ll be heartbroken?" Beatrice cut in with a scoff. "At my age, I’ve seen worse. The only thing that matters to me is your well-being. The rest? I couldn’t care less."

Evelyn’s throat burned. "I know you love me the most."

Beatrice rolled her eyes and gave Evelyn’s forehead a light shove. "Enough sentimentality. I’m going to rest."

The abrupt dismissal stung, but Evelyn didn’t let it show.

Once Beatrice was gone, her expression darkened. William and Margaret’s behavior was beyond disappointing.

I should have known better.

Exactly what I feared has happened.

What’s left to hold onto now?

Unsurprisingly, William didn’t give up. When persuasion failed, he marched straight to Martin Group headquarters to confront Nathaniel.

That evening, Nathaniel mentioned the encounter. Evelyn met his gaze squarely. "Would continuing the partnership with Mitchell Corporation benefit Martin Group?"

"No."

Nathaniel studied her, understanding the unspoken question, but he answered honestly.

"Then proceed as you see fit," she said evenly. "I don’t want you making concessions because of the baby. Even if you did, I wouldn’t thank you for it."

His lips twitched. "Concessions? That’s a harsh way to put it."

"Is it?"

She didn’t think so. This wasn’t some trivial favor—it was a multimillion-dollar corporate decision. More importantly, she refused to exploit their unborn child for gain.

So what if I’m blunt?

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed slightly. "Do you not want me working with Mitchell Corporation for the child’s sake, or because you don’t want to feel indebted to me?"

"Is there a difference?"

"Of course. The first is about your principles. The second is about your pride."

"But the outcome is the same." Her voice was steady, her gaze unwavering. "Nathaniel, my opinion doesn’t change anything. You’ll make the decision based on Martin Group’s interests, not our relationship. So whether it’s principles or pride—it doesn’t matter."

Her cold rationality left him silent.

He couldn’t tell if she was being pragmatic to spare him trouble—or if there was something else beneath the surface.

The conversation died there. Pushing further would only lead to another argument.

But then Nathaniel frowned, studying her closely. "Are you upset with me? Is that why you’re being like this?"



###Chapter 282

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, blinking against the light. Beside her, Nathaniel slept soundly, his breathing steady. She studied his face—the strong jawline, the faint scar near his temple—memorizing every detail as if she might forget.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory.

"Emergency meeting at the office. We need you here ASAP."

Evelyn frowned. Gregory never called for emergencies unless it was serious. She slipped out of bed, careful not to wake Nathaniel, and dressed quickly.

Downstairs, Alfred was already waiting with her coffee. "Good morning, Mrs. Martin. Your car is ready."

"Thank you, Alfred." She took the cup, the warmth seeping into her fingers. "Tell Nathaniel I had to leave early."

The drive to the office was tense. The city streets blurred past as Evelyn’s mind raced through possibilities. Had their latest project hit a snag? Was it the investors?

When she arrived, Gregory was pacing in the conference room. His usually composed demeanor was frayed at the edges.

"What’s going on?" Evelyn asked, setting her bag down.

Gregory handed her a folder. "Summit Realty just pulled out of the deal. Sebastian Wilson claims we breached contract terms."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. "That’s impossible. We followed every clause."

"Apparently, they disagree." Gregory sighed. "And there’s more. Isabella Davis is involved."

Evelyn’s grip tightened on the folder. Isabella—Nathaniel’s ex—had always been a shadow in their lives. "How?"

"She’s been whispering in Sebastian’s ear. Feeding him lies about our firm’s stability."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. This wasn’t just business. This was personal.

Her phone buzzed again. A text from Nathaniel:

"We need to talk. Meet me at home."

The words sent a chill down her spine. What now?

As she left the office, Evelyn’s mind spun with questions. One thing was clear—Isabella wasn’t done with them yet. And this time, she was playing for keeps.

Evelyn didn't grasp the implication behind his question.

Her momentary silence was interpreted as silent agreement by Nathaniel.

Their gazes locked as he spoke in a measured, hushed tone, "Isabella came to the Martin Group to discuss the contract with me."

At his words, realization dawned on Evelyn.

Is he referring to that phone call when Samuel mentioned Isabella was looking for him?

After returning to Martin Manor and hiring Rosalind, the matter had been left untouched—so much so that Evelyn had nearly forgotten about it.

She met Nathaniel's eyes calmly, a faint smile playing on her lips. "Nathaniel, are you explaining yourself to me?"

Nathaniel stiffened slightly, as if suddenly aware of his own actions.

His gaze remained steady as he echoed her words, "What would you do if I were?"

Evelyn hadn't expected such directness from him.

Before, he would have dismissed it outright, telling me not to overthink things. But now?

Her eyes widened slightly, momentarily at a loss for words.

Nathaniel pressed, "Evelyn, answer me. What would you do if I was explaining myself to you?"

She averted her gaze quickly, then offered a gentle smile. "Nathaniel, you don’t need to explain. I never misunderstood. Honestly, if you hadn’t brought it up, I might have forgotten entirely."

"Really?"

His eyes narrowed, his expression cooling instantly, the warmth in his voice replaced by something distant.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, choosing silence.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "Then I was overthinking it."

The air between them grew heavy, thick with unspoken thoughts. Neither spoke, each lost in their own mind, the other’s thoughts just out of reach.

As for the Mitchell family, Nathaniel had followed standard procedure. In truth, he’d anticipated Evelyn asking for his help—had even prepared to say yes if she did.

But she hadn’t. So he didn’t.

His refusal sent William into a panic. He’d been certain Nathaniel would agree, given Evelyn’s pregnancy. But the outright rejection left him speechless, his mind racing for alternatives.

William was too agitated to eat. "If Nathaniel won’t intervene, the Mitchell Group is finished."

Margaret frowned. "Maybe Evelyn didn’t explain it properly. I’ll talk to her again!"

"What’s the point? She resents us for sending her to stay with Beatrice in Dattlech. She’s probably delighted to see us struggle!" William’s anger flared at the mere mention of Evelyn.

Sophia, overhearing, stepped forward, determination flashing in her eyes. "Dad, Mom, I’ll go talk to her. I’ll make her understand."

Without waiting for a response, she hurried out.

William sighed heavily as he watched her leave.

The truth was, the Mitchell Group had been surviving on the Martin Group’s coattails for years—superficially stable, but drowning in debt. With Nathaniel cutting ties, creditors had begun circling, demanding repayment William couldn’t provide.

Had the Martin Group continued their partnership, he could’ve managed the interest payments. But the principal remained untouched, and now, with no lifeline, the situation was dire.

The Mitchell Group had two options: restructure entirely to become self-sufficient or declare bankruptcy, liquidate assets, and start anew.

The latter was impossible. William was far past the age of rebuilding from scratch.

That was why he was desperate. But desperation didn’t mean he’d given up.

Sophia found Evelyn just as she stepped out of a meeting—her mind freshly set on entering the architectural competition.
###Chapter 283

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort in the Maldives. The design was ambitious, but she thrived on challenges.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Ms. Mitchell, Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn straightened, smoothing the fabric of her tailored blazer. "Send him in."

Gregory Wilson strode in, his usual confident demeanor slightly off. His tie was loosened, and there was a tension in his jaw she hadn’t seen before.

"You look like you’ve had better mornings," she remarked, gesturing for him to sit.

Gregory exhaled sharply, dropping into the chair opposite her. "We have a problem. The investors for the Maldives project are pulling out."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. "What? Why?"

"Rumors," he muttered, rubbing his temples. "Someone’s been whispering that our designs aren’t structurally sound. That we cut corners."

Her fingers curled into fists. "That’s absurd. Who would—"

Then it hit her.

Isabella Davis.

Nathaniel’s ex had been unusually quiet since their last confrontation, but Evelyn knew better than to assume she’d given up. Isabella had connections, resources, and a vindictive streak a mile wide.

Evelyn stood abruptly, her chair scraping against the hardwood floor. "I need to talk to Nathaniel."

Gregory frowned. "You think he’s involved?"

"No," she said firmly. "But he might know how to stop this before it escalates."

Her phone buzzed before she could leave. A message from an unknown number lit up the screen:

"Did you really think you could win?"

Evelyn’s breath caught.

The game had just begun.

Though Evelyn was preparing for the competition herself, she intended to select three top talents from the company as her assistants. If fortune favored her and she secured a spot in the top three, her team would share the spotlight.

Her conditions were straightforward. "There's still time before the competition begins. If you wish to contend for a place as my assistant, you must submit a complete architectural design within ten days. Mr. Wilson and I will evaluate them professionally. To ensure fairness, I've also invited the renowned designer Seraphina to join us via video call for the final selection."

Who was Seraphina?

In the design world, one might not recognize Nathaniel of the Martin Group, but Seraphina was a name no one could ignore.

Her creations were hailed as masterpieces, rivaling the most celebrated works in the industry. Yet she remained an enigma—her face unseen, her identity shrouded in mystery. Some whispered she disguised herself as a woman; others claimed she was too hideous to show her face.

But none could deny her brilliance.

Her portfolio spanned fashion, jewelry, and beyond.

Evelyn's announcement electrified the office. Such an opportunity was unheard of elsewhere. Here, everyone stood on equal footing, each with a chance to prove themselves.

After the meeting, Evelyn retreated to her office. No sooner had she settled into her chair than Gabrielle knocked. "Ms. Mitchell, your sister is here."

Evelyn stiffened, the word foreign on her tongue. "Sister? You must be mistaken. I don’t have one."

The concept felt alien, so she dismissed it without hesitation.

Gabrielle hesitated before gently reminding her, "Ms. Mitchell… the Mitchell family—"

Evelyn’s gaze sharpened. "Where is she?"

Gabrielle nodded. Sophia Mitchell stood just behind her. She stepped aside, allowing Sophia to enter before quietly closing the door.

Evelyn studied her without a trace of warmth. "Why are you here? Is there a problem?"

Sophia stared back, conflicted. The news of Evelyn’s pregnancy had shaken her. Yet, bound by family duty, she had come.

The thought of Evelyn carrying a child unsettled her deeply.

Her prolonged silence prompted Evelyn to arch a brow. "Did you come just to stare at me in silence?"

Finally, Sophia spoke. "Evelyn, you know why I’m here."

"Do I?"

"Must you be so cold? Have you no heart at all?" Sophia’s voice trembled with emotion.

Evelyn’s lips curled into a faint, humorless smile. "As my sister, shouldn’t you know best whether I have a heart? If you were in my place, what would you do?"

As a child, she had envied Sophia—achingly, relentlessly. Later, exiled to Beatrice’s care, she had been grateful. Had she stayed, the Mitchells would have twisted her into something dark. Something cruel.

Something like the woman standing before her now.



###Chapter 284

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her blueprints. She tapped her pen against the desk, lost in thought. The Martin Group project was nearing its final stages, but something felt off.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel.

"Meeting in 30. Edward wants to see us."

Evelyn sighed. Edward Martin wasn’t just Nathaniel’s grandfather—he was the iron-willed patriarch of the Martin empire. Every meeting with him felt like walking into a lion’s den.

She grabbed her blazer and headed out.

The elevator ride to the executive floor was tense. When the doors slid open, Nathaniel was already waiting, his expression unreadable.

"You okay?" she asked.

He gave a tight nod. "Let’s just get this over with."

Edward’s office was as imposing as ever—dark wood, leather chairs, and the faint scent of cigar smoke lingering in the air. The old man sat behind his desk, sharp eyes assessing them.

"I’ve reviewed the latest reports," Edward began without preamble. "The numbers are good. But I’m not convinced about the timeline."

Evelyn straightened. "We’re on track. The delays were unavoidable, but we’ve adjusted."

Edward’s gaze flicked to Nathaniel. "And you? What’s your take?"

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Evelyn’s right. The team’s handling it."

A beat of silence. Then Edward leaned back, fingers steepled. "Fine. But if this slips again, heads will roll."

Evelyn exhaled as they stepped out.

"That could’ve gone worse," Nathaniel muttered.

She shot him a look. "Barely."

Before he could reply, his phone rang. He glanced at the screen, and his expression darkened.

Isabella.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. She knew that name—Nathaniel’s ex, the woman who still had a way of slipping back into his life at the worst moments.

"I have to take this," he said, already walking away.

Evelyn watched him go, unease settling in her chest.

Something was coming. She could feel it.

Like a pristine canvas exposed to corrosive darkness for too long, even the purest soul would eventually be tainted.

Evelyn had stopped resenting Sophia long ago. She'd tried to erase her sister and the entire Mitchell family from her memory.

Yet the moment she succeeded, they dragged her back in.

How absurd.

She had never wronged the Mitchells. So why was Sophia accusing her of having a heart of stone?

Evelyn's faint smile made Sophia narrow her eyes, an uneasy sensation creeping up her spine.

But loyalty bound Sophia to the Mitchells. Without them, she'd be nothing.

"Listen," Sophia lowered her voice, frustration lacing her words. "I get why you're bitter about being sent away as a child. But we're still family. Would you really take pride in watching the Mitchell Group collapse? In seeing our parents ruined?"

Her tone turned pleading. "Isn't that right, Evelyn?"

"You've always been sheltered," Evelyn replied coolly. "I wasn't. If you're here to convince me to beg Nathaniel for mercy, save your breath. I won't. And he wouldn't agree even if I did."

Sophia's composure cracked. "How can you be so heartless? Mom and Dad begged you! Just because you're carrying Nathaniel's child, you think you're untouchable? You're about to be a mother yourself—how can you turn your back on your parents? Are you even fit to raise a child?"

Evelyn's silence was answer enough.

To Sophia, it was ice-cold indifference. She scoffed. "No matter how hard you try to cut ties, Evelyn, you'll always be a Mitchell. Their blood runs in your veins."

"Should I bleed it out and return it?" Evelyn's voice was dangerously soft. "Do you have any idea what I endured after they discarded me? How our mother treated me? Of course not. They poured all their love into you. So don't you dare stand there and preach to me about family."

The words left a bitter taste. She hadn’t wanted to say them.

But Sophia’s relentless pressure had scraped her patience raw.

If they all saw her as cruel, so be it.

Evelyn turned her attention back to the blueprint in her hands, but a thought struck her. She paused, then said calmly, "Charity won’t save the Mitchell Group. If you want to prevent bankruptcy, convince Father to restructure the company. Clean house. Change their entire business model."

Sophia didn’t hear advice—only mockery.

"Don’t get arrogant," she hissed. "Pregnancy won’t guarantee you a lifetime as Nathaniel’s wife."

With that, she stormed out.

Evelyn watched her go, a pang of disappointment cutting through her. She’d thought Sophia was smarter than their parents. That she might actually understand.

Guess I overestimated her.

Setting the blueprint aside, Evelyn exhaled slowly. The Mitchell Group’s downfall wasn’t sudden—it had been crumbling for years. Without drastic changes, their fate was sealed.

Her lips pressed into a thin line as she sank into thought.



###Chapter 285

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, blinking against the light as she turned to find Nathaniel already awake, his piercing gaze fixed on her.

"You're up early," she murmured, stretching beneath the sheets.

Nathaniel smirked, brushing a stray lock of hair from her face. "Couldn’t sleep. Too much on my mind."

Evelyn sat up, studying the tension in his jaw. "Is it about the board meeting today?"

He exhaled sharply, nodding. "Edward’s pushing for another merger. He thinks it’ll secure our position, but I’m not convinced."

She reached for his hand, squeezing it gently. "You’ll handle it. You always do."

His fingers tightened around hers. "Not without you."

A soft knock interrupted them. Alfred’s voice came through the door. "Mr. Martin, your car is ready. And Miss Mitchell—your sister is on the phone."

Evelyn groaned. "Sophia never calls this early unless it’s an emergency."

Nathaniel chuckled, pressing a kiss to her temple. "Go. I’ll see you at the office."

Downstairs, Evelyn grabbed the phone, bracing herself. "What’s wrong?"

Sophia’s voice was breathless. "You need to come to the studio. Now."

Evelyn frowned. "Why? What happened?"

"It’s Isabella. She’s here—with Vanessa. And they’re demanding to see you."

The name sent a chill down Evelyn’s spine. Isabella never showed up without an agenda.

"I’ll be there in twenty."

Hanging up, Evelyn grabbed her coat, her mind racing. Whatever game Isabella was playing, she wasn’t about to let her win. Not again.

The drive to the studio was a blur. Inside, the tension was palpable. Isabella stood near the window, her posture flawless, while Vanessa hovered nearby, her expression unreadable.

Sophia rushed to Evelyn’s side. "They’ve been here for fifteen minutes. Refused to say why until you arrived."

Evelyn squared her shoulders, stepping forward. "Isabella. To what do I owe the pleasure?"

Isabella turned, her smile razor-sharp. "Evelyn. Always so direct." She paused, tilting her head. "I thought you’d want to hear this from me first. I’m back in Nathaniel’s life—for good."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked, but she kept her voice steady. "Is that so?"

Vanessa finally spoke, her tone smooth. "We’ve signed a deal with Martin Group. Isabella will be the face of their new campaign. A… long-term partnership."

The words hit like a physical blow. Nathaniel hadn’t mentioned this. Hadn’t warned her.

Evelyn forced a smile. "Congratulations. Though I’m surprised Nathaniel didn’t tell me."

Isabella’s eyes gleamed. "Oh, he will. Soon." She stepped closer, lowering her voice. "Face it, Evelyn. You were always just a placeholder."

The door burst open before Evelyn could respond. Nathaniel stood there, his expression dark. "Isabella. We need to talk. Now."

Evelyn’s breath caught. The game had just gotten a lot more complicated.

The silence didn’t last long before Nathaniel’s call came through.

His voice was smooth yet commanding over the line. "I’m leaving Mayby tonight for a business trip to Teninus."

"Tonight?" Evelyn asked, surprised.

"Yes."

She exhaled softly. "How long will you be gone?"

"Two or three days," he murmured, his tone lower than usual.

Evelyn nodded to herself. "Alright."

A brief pause stretched between them.

Then, Nathaniel’s voice dropped to a whisper. "That’s all you have to say?"

"Safe travels?"

His laughter burst through the phone, rich and warm, sending an unexpected shiver down her spine.

She frowned. "What’s so funny?"

"Evelyn," he said, amusement still lacing his words, "is that really all you want to say?"

"You’re going away for a couple of days. What’s wrong with wishing you a safe trip?"

"Nothing’s wrong," he replied, though his tone shifted, turning cooler. "Maybe I’m the one expecting too much." The displeasure in his voice was unmistakable. Then, sharply, he added, "Why don’t you stay at Martin Manor while I’m gone? Mother misses you. And Grandfather would be thrilled to have you back."

"I’ll visit, but I’m not moving in. It’s too much trouble, and it’s not practical. I need to take care of Grandma, so I’ll stay at the apartment."

When she put it like that, Nathaniel didn’t press further.

Still, he couldn’t resist giving orders. "At least let the driver take you to and from work."

"Fine. I will. Anything else?"

"Anything else?" He scoffed, irritation thickening his voice. "Evelyn, do you think I’m giving you orders? I’m looking out for you. Tsk."

Evelyn pressed her lips together.

Here we go again.

After countless exchanges like this, she’d learned one thing—silence was her best defense.

If she didn’t engage, she won.

The call dragged on for several more minutes before Nathaniel finally got to the point. "Pack my things for the trip."

"Why?"

"What do you mean, why?"

"Nathaniel, I’m pregnant."

Oh, now she’s using that as a shield, he thought, amused despite himself.

A slow, knowing smile curved his lips. "You don’t have to lift a finger. But since you are pregnant, we could—"

"Fine, I’ll pack your luggage. Will you come back for it, or should Samuel pick it up?"

"I’ll come back. Our flight’s late. I’ll have dinner with you before I leave."

"Alright. I’ll let Rosalind know to prepare something."

Evelyn quickly found an excuse to hang up before he could say anything else.

Even though they were living together now, Nathaniel hadn’t crossed that line—not physically, and certainly not with suggestive remarks like the one he’d just made. It left her flustered, unsure how to react.

They were still married. It wasn’t unreasonable.

But something nagged at her, a feeling she couldn’t quite place.

Things between them had shifted. There was no going back to how things were before.

By the time Nathaniel returned, Evelyn had already packed his suitcase. She was efficient at it—years of marriage had made her an expert.

But this was the first time she’d done it since they’d nearly divorced.

The effort left her slightly breathless. Whether it was the pregnancy or not, she didn’t know, but her body temperature seemed higher lately. The slightest exertion made her sweat.

Alone in the bedroom, she stripped off her loungewear, leaving only a black sports bra, her slightly rounded belly on display. The rest of her—her waist, her arms—looked just as it had before the pregnancy.

Stretching toward the window, she didn’t notice Nathaniel standing in the doorway, watching her.

Her skin was smooth, glowing against the dark fabric.

His eyes darkened.

He shut the door behind him and crossed the room in quick strides, wrapping his arms around her from behind.

Evelyn gasped.



###Chapter 286

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the design, a project she had poured her heart into for months. The phone buzzed, interrupting her concentration.

"Evelyn, we need to talk." Nathaniel's voice was tense, sending a shiver down her spine.

She gripped the phone tighter. "What's wrong?"

"Meet me at the penthouse. Now." The line went dead before she could respond.

Evelyn's stomach twisted. Nathaniel rarely sounded like this—cold, distant, as if the warmth between them had evaporated overnight. She grabbed her coat and hurried out, barely acknowledging Gabrielle’s concerned glance.

The elevator ride to the penthouse felt endless. When the doors slid open, Nathaniel stood by the window, his back to her, shoulders rigid. The silence was suffocating.

"You wanted to see me?" she asked, stepping forward.

He turned slowly, his expression unreadable. "I received a call from Isabella."

Evelyn froze. Isabella—his ex, the woman who had once held his heart. The name alone was enough to make her pulse race.

"What did she want?" Evelyn forced her voice to remain steady.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "She claims she has proof that our marriage is a sham. That you only married me for the Martin name."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "That's ridiculous. You know that's not true."

"Do I?" His gaze darkened. "Because lately, I’ve been questioning everything."

The accusation stung. She reached for his hand, but he pulled away.

"Tell me the truth, Evelyn. Did you ever love me, or was this all just a game?"

Her vision blurred. "How can you even ask me that?"

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Answer the question."

Before she could speak, the doorbell rang. Alfred’s voice came through the intercom. "Mr. Martin, Ms. Davis is here to see you."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. Isabella had come in person.

Nathaniel didn’t hesitate. "Let her in."

As the door opened, Isabella strode in, her confident smirk making Evelyn’s blood boil. She held up a folder. "I think you’ll both find this very... enlightening."

Nathaniel took it, flipping through the contents. His face paled.

Evelyn’s heart pounded. "What is it?"

He looked up, his eyes colder than she’d ever seen them. "Proof that you’ve been lying to me from the start."

The room spun. Evelyn reached for the folder, but Isabella blocked her.

"Oh no, sweetheart. This is between Nathaniel and me now."

Evelyn’s hands clenched into fists. Whatever Isabella had fabricated, she wouldn’t let it destroy what she and Nathaniel had built.

But as Nathaniel’s gaze remained locked on the documents, doubt crept in. Had she already lost him?

Evelyn gasped.

"It's me."

Nathaniel's deep, gravelly voice whispered against her ear.

She exhaled in relief. "You're back already?"

"I promised you dinner."

"Let go first." His proximity unnerved her—especially his hands splayed across her bare stomach, the heat of his palms searing into her skin.

She squirmed, but Nathaniel's grip tightened. "Don't move. I just want to hold you. But if you keep wriggling..."

A blatant threat.

Regret flooded her. I'd rather melt than strip like this again.

She froze. Nathaniel traced idle circles on her abdomen. "Business trip. Only three days. Be good."

"Fine."

"Video calls. Every night."

"What?"

"How else do I read to the baby?" His hand lingered over her belly.

Evelyn scowled. "I'll manage. Now release me."

"Scared of me?"

"No."

"Then stay."

She clenched her jaw.

Nathaniel chuckled. "Silence means yes, Evelyn."

Ugh. He always twists my words.

The embrace stretched until Rosalind knocked, announcing dinner.

Evelyn shoved his chest. "Enough. I'm starving."

"Why the rush?"

"Nathaniel!"

He smirked. "You started this, walking around half-dressed."

"I was sweating!"

But he didn’t budge. Rosalind had discreetly left after setting the table, leaving them alone in the penthouse.

Evelyn huffed. "I’m hungry. And pregnant. This is cruelty."

"I know." His voice roughened as he spun her to face him, his arousal pressing against her. "But I’m ravenous."

Her cheeks burned.

Then he pinned her against the glass wall, and protests dissolved into breathless compliance.

He’s insufferable.

Frustrated, she bit his shoulder hard—until her strength waned.

Later, he carried her to the shower, then reheated dinner while she collapsed onto the bed.

She devoured the meal, shot him a glare, and yanked the covers over her head.

Nathaniel smoothed her hair. "Flight’s at midnight. Sleep. Call me when you wake."



###Chapter 287

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the design, a modern villa project she had been pouring her heart into for weeks. The soft hum of the city outside was a comforting backdrop to her thoughts.

A sharp knock at the door interrupted her concentration.

"Come in," she called, not looking up.

Gabrielle, her assistant, stepped inside, holding a sleek tablet. "Evelyn, Mr. Wilson is here to see you. He says it's urgent."

Evelyn frowned. Gregory never dropped by unannounced unless something was wrong. "Send him in."

Gregory strode in moments later, his usual composed demeanor replaced by visible tension. His dark eyes flickered with unease as he closed the door behind him. "We have a problem."

Evelyn leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms. "What kind of problem?"

"The Summit Realty deal." Gregory ran a hand through his hair. "Sebastian Wilson just pulled out. He claims there are structural concerns with our latest proposal."

Evelyn's stomach twisted. That project was their biggest contract this year—losing it would be disastrous. "That's impossible. We triple-checked every detail."

Gregory exhaled sharply. "I know. But he's insisting on a full review by his team before moving forward. And if they find even the smallest flaw..."

He didn’t need to finish. Evelyn understood. Their reputation was on the line.

She stood abruptly, determination hardening her features. "Then we’ll prove him wrong. Get me everything we have on the project—every calculation, every revision. We’re not backing down without a fight."

Gregory nodded, a flicker of admiration in his gaze. "I’ll have Jonathan pull the files."

As he turned to leave, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. Nathaniel’s name flashed on the screen.

Her heart skipped a beat.

She hesitated before answering. Things between them had been… complicated lately. But she couldn’t ignore him now.

"Evelyn." His deep voice sent an involuntary shiver down her spine. "We need to talk."

Her grip tightened on the phone. "About what?"

"Edward." Nathaniel’s tone was grave. "He’s making moves behind the scenes. And if we don’t act fast, we could lose everything."

Evelyn’s breath caught.

This wasn’t just about the project anymore.

Evelyn didn’t utter a single word.

Nathaniel didn’t leave either. Instead, he leaned closer, his voice barely above a whisper. "Evelyn, just give me a response. Please?"

Still, silence.

He reached out, tugging the covers down just enough to reveal her face. "Did you hear what I said?"

"I heard you," she muttered, turning her head away. "Nathaniel, you’re insufferable. Just go. You’re driving me crazy."

Her irritation was palpable.

Nathaniel chuckled, pulling the blanket back over her before standing. With one last glance, he left the bedroom.

Only when the soft click of the door echoed through the room did Evelyn finally relax into her pillow, exhaustion pulling her under.

She slept deeply, undisturbed until seven the next morning.

When she opened her eyes, she stretched lazily, lingering in bed. There was no physical discomfort—just a bone-deep weariness that clung to her.

Her phone buzzed with a message from Nathaniel, sent well past midnight. She had been asleep then, and now, seeing it, she had no intention of replying.

The memory of his words from last night resurfaced, stirring fresh annoyance.

"You can’t help me pack. But since you’ve been pregnant, we..."

Ugh.

After washing up, she found Rosalind had already prepared breakfast. "Rosalind," Evelyn said, "he’s away on business. For the next couple of days, just make enough for me."

"Of course," Rosalind replied warmly, setting down a plate of fresh fruit. "You should eat more of these. It’ll give the baby glowing skin and bright eyes."

"Really?"

"Absolutely."

Evelyn smiled. "Then I’ll leave the menu entirely to you."

Rosalind was kind, and Evelyn appreciated her gentle presence.

Breakfast done, Evelyn headed to the office.

With Nathaniel gone, she slipped back into the rhythm of her earlier days—when she had first moved in and lived alone.

Work had been hectic lately, her latest projects keeping everyone on their toes. Even during breaks, the team hustled, determined to meet deadlines.

The chaos was oddly satisfying.

Passing Gregory’s office, she noticed him massaging his temples. She hesitated, then knocked lightly before stepping inside.

"Gregory, are you alright? You look exhausted."

"It’s nothing," he said, forcing a smile. "Just a rough night. Headache."

"Do you need to go home and rest?"

His laugh was dry. "Rest? With everything going on?"

Evelyn sighed. "Is Danielle causing trouble again?"

Gregory’s expression darkened, but he said nothing.

"You can’t keep doing this to yourself," Evelyn said gently. "Maybe it’s time to get her professional help. Some things… they’re beyond what we can fix alone."

"I’m already looking into it," he admitted.

Evelyn nodded, leaving it at that. She reminded him not to push himself too hard—the company could manage without him burning out.

The rest of her day was spent buried in blueprints. With Nathaniel away, she didn’t need to visit Martin Group. Daniel could handle the handover.

By evening, the house was quiet. Too quiet.

Rosalind had left after preparing dinner—enough to feed three people, though Evelyn barely touched it.

Even her favorite dishes couldn’t stir her appetite.

Maybe I’m just too tired today.

###Chapter 288

The evening air was thick with tension as Evelyn stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows of Nathaniel’s penthouse, her fingers tracing the condensation on the glass. The city lights flickered below, a stark contrast to the storm brewing inside her.

Nathaniel’s voice cut through the silence, low and measured. “We need to talk about what happened.”

She turned to face him, her arms crossed tightly over her chest. “There’s nothing to talk about. Isabella made her intentions clear.”

His jaw clenched. “She doesn’t matter. What matters is us.”

Evelyn scoffed, her grip tightening on her elbows. “Does she really not matter? Because from where I’m standing, she’s been a constant shadow in our marriage.”

Nathaniel stepped closer, his dark eyes searching hers. “I chose you, Evelyn. Every single day, I choose you.”

Her breath hitched, but she refused to back down. “Then why does it feel like I’m still competing with a ghost?”

Before he could respond, the shrill ring of his phone shattered the moment. He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening. “It’s Samuel. There’s an emergency at the office.”

Evelyn exhaled sharply, turning back to the window. “Go. Duty calls.”

Nathaniel hesitated, his hand hovering near her shoulder before dropping it. “This isn’t over.”

The door clicked shut behind him, leaving Evelyn alone with her thoughts. The reflection in the glass showed a woman teetering on the edge—of what, she wasn’t sure.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket. A message from Gregory: We need you at the site. There’s a problem with the foundation.

She closed her eyes briefly, gathering her resolve. If there was one thing Evelyn Mitchell knew how to do, it was rebuild.

But first, she had to decide if her marriage was worth salvaging—or if it was time to walk away for good.

The Martin Group’s headquarters was in chaos when Nathaniel arrived. Samuel met him at the elevator, his usually composed demeanor frayed.

“The investors are pulling out,” Samuel said in a hushed tone. “They heard rumors about the divorce.”

Nathaniel’s expression hardened. “Who started them?”

Samuel hesitated. “Isabella’s agent, Vanessa. She’s been feeding the press.”

A cold fury settled in Nathaniel’s chest. He had tolerated Isabella’s games for too long.

“Call a press conference,” he ordered. “Tonight.”

Samuel blinked. “Sir?”

Nathaniel’s voice was steel. “I’m ending this.”

Evelyn stood at the construction site, the wind tugging at her coat as she surveyed the damage. The foundation had cracked—sabotage, according to the engineers.

Gregory handed her a coffee, his expression grim. “This wasn’t an accident.”

She took a sip, the bitterness matching her mood. “I know.”

Her phone buzzed again—a news alert. Breaking: Nathaniel Martin to Address Rumors in Live Press Conference.

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the cup.

Whatever he was about to say would change everything.

And this time, she wasn’t sure she was ready to hear it.

Evelyn had dinner with Beatrice and lingered for a while before retiring for the night. After a warm shower, she slipped beneath the covers, exhaustion weighing heavily on her eyelids.

Nathaniel hadn't called—likely preoccupied with work. She didn’t reach out either, curling around her phone as sleep claimed her.

At first, her rest was peaceful. But then—

A nightmare tore through her slumber, jolting her awake with a gasp.

Her heart hammered violently, sweat dampening her skin. She clutched the blankets, pulling them over her head as if they could shield her from the lingering dread. Sleep refused to return, leaving her drained and hollow by morning. She skipped the office entirely.

Fear kept her from sleeping alone. After breakfast, she retreated to Beatrice’s home, collapsing onto the sofa in hopes of stealing a few hours of rest.

But peace was fleeting.

Beatrice shook her awake, concern etched into her features. Evelyn’s breath came in short, panicked bursts. The nightmare clung to her—visions of blood, a terrifying fall from a cliff, and the faint, haunting cry of a baby—

She shuddered, cutting off the memory before it could fully resurface.

"Evelyn, was it another nightmare?" Beatrice asked softly, brushing damp strands of hair from her granddaughter’s forehead.

Evelyn forced a weak smile. "Probably just too many thrillers before bed."

"Are you not sleeping well with Nathaniel away?"

"I’m fine. Just restless."

"You need proper rest, dear. For the baby."

Evelyn nodded, though the thought of returning to her empty bed made her stomach twist. Still, she didn’t want Beatrice worrying. With a quiet goodbye, she left.

Back home, she played soft lullabies, hoping the gentle melodies would lull her into a dreamless sleep.

Just as her eyelids grew heavy—

Her phone rang.

She jolted upright, fumbling for the device. Nathaniel’s name flashed on the screen. Relief washed over her as she answered.

"Hello?"

"Your voice sounds off," Nathaniel observed immediately.

"Just tired. I was about to nap."

"Because I’m not there?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Don’t flatter yourself."

"Don’t you miss me?" he countered.

She hesitated. "Do you miss me?"

His low chuckle sent warmth curling through her. "I do. So answer the question."

Her breath caught. Since when did Nathaniel speak so openly?

She pressed her lips together. "I don’t see the point."

"No?"

"Even if I said yes, you’re still in Teninus. Words won’t change that."

"Stubborn," he murmured, though amusement colored his tone.

She never answered.

Their call ended shortly after—Nathaniel had meetings, after all.

Alone again, Evelyn curled onto her side, phone clutched to her chest. Sleep still eluded her.

By afternoon, exhaustion finally dragged her under.

But the nightmares returned.

This time, she dreamed of falling—plummeting from her balcony, her body broken on the pavement below. Blood pooled around her. A baby’s cries echoed endlessly. And in the darkness, two hollow, bloodied eyes stared back—

She woke with a scream trapped in her throat.

###Chapter 289

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the design—a new eco-friendly residential complex for Martin Group. The project was her baby, one she had poured her heart into for months.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn straightened, smoothing her blouse. "Send him in."

Gregory Wilson strode in, his usual confident demeanor slightly frayed at the edges. "We have a problem," he said without preamble, dropping a file onto her desk.

She flipped it open, her stomach tightening at the sight of the inspection report. Red marks highlighted multiple structural concerns. "This can't be right. We followed every regulation."

Gregory ran a hand through his hair. "The city inspector is demanding revisions before they’ll approve the permits. If we don’t comply within the week, the project gets delayed—indefinitely."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. A delay meant budget overruns, unhappy investors, and worst of all, Nathaniel’s disappointment. She couldn’t let that happen.

"I’ll handle it," she said, determination steeling her voice. "Get me a meeting with the inspector. Today."

Gregory hesitated. "Evelyn, you know how these people operate. They don’t just change their minds because we ask nicely."

She met his gaze, unflinching. "Then we’ll make them."

Nathaniel Martin leaned back in his leather chair, listening as Samuel Yates briefed him on the quarterly earnings. The numbers were strong, but his mind kept drifting to Evelyn. She had been distant lately, buried in her work. He missed her.

His phone buzzed—an unknown number. He almost dismissed it, but something made him answer.

"Mr. Martin," a smooth, feminine voice purred. "Long time no see."

His blood ran cold. "Isabella."

She laughed, the sound like silk over steel. "I’m in town. We should catch up."

Nathaniel’s grip tightened on the phone. "There’s nothing to discuss."

"Oh, but there is," she countered. "Unless you want certain... revelations about your wife to become public?"

A chill slithered down his spine. "What are you talking about?"

"Meet me tonight. Eight o’clock. The usual place." The line went dead.

Nathaniel stared at the phone, dread coiling in his gut. Whatever game Isabella was playing, Evelyn was the pawn. And he would be damned if he let her win.

Evelyn rubbed her temples as she stepped out of the city inspector’s office. The meeting had been brutal, but she’d managed to negotiate a compromise. The relief was short-lived, however, as her phone buzzed with a message from an unfamiliar number.

Unknown: You should ask your husband about his dinner plans tonight.

Her breath hitched. A photo followed—Nathaniel entering an upscale restaurant, his expression unreadable. The timestamp was from last week.

Then another image loaded.

Isabella Davis, smirking at the camera, a wine glass raised in mock toast.

Evelyn’s world tilted.

What the hell is going on?

Evelyn jolted awake, her skin slick with sweat. Her fingers instinctively brushed over her abdomen before she realized it had only been a nightmare.

But then—footsteps.

Her breath hitched. She sat frozen, pulse hammering.

Evelyn slipped out of bed, bare feet silent against the floor. She eased the bedroom door open, creeping forward until the sound grew louder. Closer. Then—

"Rosalind?"

The woman turned, mop in hand, blinking in surprise. "Oh! Mrs. Martin. I didn’t mean to wake you. I came early to tidy up since I thought you’d be home. Did I disturb you?"

Evelyn shook her head, though her nerves still hummed. She moved to the kitchen for water, but the nightmare clung to her like a shadow.

She hadn’t been sleeping well. The dreams kept coming, each one leaving her more unsettled than the last.

Exhaustion weighed her down. She had no appetite, only asking Rosalind to prepare something light for dinner. For now, she curled onto the sofa, eyes closed but not sleeping. No dreams here. Just quiet.

Night fell, and the house felt too empty again. Her fingers tightened around her phone. She wanted to call Nathaniel—wanted him here, beside her, his warmth chasing away the lingering fear. But she refused to seem needy.

Then his name lit up her screen.

"Did you eat?" His voice was low, familiar.

"Yes."

"Good. Rest early. I have a dinner meeting tonight. It’ll run late."

"Okay."

Her lips pressed together. The loneliness ached.

Nathaniel hesitated. "You sound off. Tired? Or is something wrong?"

That gentle concern unraveled her. For a second, she wanted to cry, to spill everything. Instead, she whispered, "Just... bored."

"Bored?" His chuckle sent warmth through her. "Or do you miss me?"

Again with that question.

Did he really need to hear her say it?

Before she could answer, Samuel’s voice cut in on his end. "Mr. Martin, the car is ready."

Nathaniel murmured, "I have to go. Be good. Wait for me."

"Okay." She paused. Then, softly—"Nathaniel."

"Hmm?"

"I think... I might miss you. A little."

She hung up before he could respond.

Alone again, Evelyn sighed. She had gotten used to solitude before. But now Nathaniel’s presence lingered everywhere—his scent on the sheets, his voice in her memories. It made the quiet unbearable.

On the other end, Nathaniel stared at his phone, a slow smile curving his lips.

Samuel blinked. Mr. Martin... smiling?
###Chapter 290

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's penthouse, illuminating the sleek modern furniture. She stood by the glass wall, sipping her coffee, her mind racing with the events of last night. Nathaniel had been distant, his usual warmth replaced by an unsettling silence.

Her phone buzzed on the marble countertop. It was a message from Gregory.

"Evelyn, we need to talk. The Summit Realty deal is falling apart. Sebastian is making unreasonable demands."

She exhaled sharply, her fingers tightening around the phone. This project was supposed to be her breakthrough, the one that would solidify her reputation in the industry. But now, with Sebastian Wilson playing games, everything was at risk.

Before she could reply, the penthouse door clicked open. Nathaniel stepped inside, his tailored suit immaculate as always, but his expression was unreadable.

"You're up early," he remarked, his voice cool.

Evelyn studied him for a moment. "Something's bothering you."

He hesitated, then walked to the bar cart and poured himself a drink—whiskey, neat. "Isabella called."

The name sent a jolt through Evelyn. Isabella Davis, Nathaniel's ex, the woman who had once held his heart.

"What did she want?" Evelyn kept her tone neutral, though her pulse quickened.

Nathaniel took a slow sip before answering. "She's back in town. And she wants to meet."

Evelyn's grip on her coffee cup tightened. "Why now?"

He met her gaze, his dark eyes unreadable. "That's what I intend to find out."

The air between them grew heavy, charged with unspoken tension. Evelyn forced a smile. "Well, don't keep her waiting."

Nathaniel frowned. "Evelyn—"

She cut him off with a wave of her hand. "I have a meeting with Gregory. The Summit deal is in trouble."

His expression darkened. "Sebastian again?"

She nodded. "I'll handle it."

Nathaniel set his glass down with a sharp clink. "Let me know if you need me."

Evelyn watched as he strode out, his broad shoulders tense. She exhaled slowly, her mind already shifting to the battle ahead—both in business and in love.

Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was Charlotte.

"Girl, we need to talk. Now. Meet me at The Velvet."

Evelyn sighed. Whatever Charlotte had to say, it couldn't be good.

With one last glance at the empty penthouse, she grabbed her purse and headed out, steeling herself for the storm brewing on the horizon.

The moment the call ended, Nathaniel's expression turned icy. His gaze flickered toward Samuel with chilling indifference. "We're leaving."

"Yes, Mr. Martin."

Samuel bowed his head and swiftly opened the car door, following Nathaniel to the dinner engagement.

Meanwhile, Evelyn clutched her phone tightly, her fingers trembling. She couldn’t bring herself to look at the screen again.

Why did she feel so unsettled?

She replayed their conversation in her mind—nothing she’d said had been unreasonable. And yet, her chest ached with an inexplicable weight.

Perhaps the call had drained her. Exhaustion pulled her under, and she fell asleep faster than expected.

But the night had other plans.

A nightmare jolted her awake in the dead of night, her heart pounding violently. Sweat clung to her skin as she gasped for air.

She couldn’t calm down.

Before she could stop herself, her fingers dialed Nathaniel’s number.

"Evelyn?"

His voice was rough with sleep, yet instantly alert.

Hearing him say her name snapped her back to reality. What had she done?

When she didn’t respond, his tone sharpened. "Evelyn? Are you there?"

"I—" Her voice cracked. "I’m here."

"What’s wrong?"

She swallowed hard. "I had a nightmare. I didn’t tell you before, but... I’ve been having them ever since you left for your trip. I just woke up from another one. Nathaniel, I’m scared."

The raw vulnerability in her whisper sent a jolt through him.

In an instant, he was wide awake.

Throwing off the covers, he strode across the room, keeping his voice steady. "Why didn’t you say anything sooner? It’s just a dream. You’re safe, understand?"

Evelyn bit her lip. Logically, she knew dreams weren’t real. But the terror felt so vivid—so possible.

"I keep dreaming that something happens to the baby... and to me," she whispered.

"Evelyn." His voice turned sharp. "Don’t say that."

She fell silent, but the fear lingered.

After a brief pause, Nathaniel exhaled. "Listen to me. I’m coming back. Turn on the TV, or go to Beatrice’s room. If you don’t want to wake her, I’ll call Victoria right now to stay with you."

"No, it’s too late. Don’t disturb her—and you don’t have to rush back. I just... needed to hear your voice. I’ll be fine."

"Evelyn." His voice softened. "We’re married. You don’t have to be polite with me. If you won’t let me call my mother or your grandmother, then let me be there for you. I’m your husband. That’s my job."

Her breath hitched.

The call didn’t end until Nathaniel reached the airport. In the background, she heard him instructing Samuel to book the earliest flight back to Mayby—even if it meant a layover. He wouldn’t arrive until dawn.

How could she not be moved?

Before boarding, his voice dropped to a low murmur. "Wait for me, Evelyn. I’ll be there soon."

###Chapter 291

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her blueprints. She tapped her pen absently against the desk, her mind elsewhere. Nathaniel had been distant lately—ever since that charity gala where Isabella had made her grand reappearance.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Gregory.

"Meeting in 10. Summit Realty wants revisions on the waterfront project."

Evelyn sighed. Work never stopped, even when her personal life was unraveling. She grabbed her tablet and headed for the conference room, her heels clicking sharply against the polished floors.

Inside, Gregory was already deep in discussion with Jonathan Blake, Summit Realty’s project manager. Sebastian Wilson, the CEO, leaned against the window, his expression unreadable.

"Ah, Evelyn," Sebastian greeted, his voice smooth. "We were just discussing your latest design. There are... concerns."

Evelyn forced a professional smile. "What kind of concerns?"

Jonathan cleared his throat. "The budget. The materials you’ve specified are pushing us over the limit."

Gregory shot her a warning glance, but Evelyn straightened. "Cutting corners now will cost more in the long run. This isn’t just another high-rise—it’s a landmark."

Sebastian studied her, then smirked. "Passionate as always. Fine. But if costs spiral, it’s on your firm."

The meeting ended, tension lingering in the air. As Evelyn gathered her things, her phone buzzed again—Caroline.

"Emergency girls’ night. My place. 8 PM. No excuses."

Evelyn exhaled. She needed this.

Nathaniel stood at the edge of the Martin Group’s rooftop terrace, the city lights sprawling below. Samuel approached, holding out a whiskey.

"Long day?" Samuel asked.

Nathaniel took the glass, swirling the amber liquid. "Isabella’s back in town."

Samuel raised a brow. "And?"

"And nothing." Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "It’s just... complicated."

Samuel hesitated. "Evelyn knows?"

Nathaniel didn’t answer. He didn’t need to.

His phone rang—Richard.

"Your grandfather wants to see you. Tonight."

Nathaniel downed the whiskey. "Tell him I’m on my way."

At Caroline’s apartment, Evelyn collapsed onto the couch, a glass of wine already in hand.

"Spill," Caroline demanded.

Evelyn hesitated, then let it all out—Isabella’s sudden return, Nathaniel’s withdrawal, the tension at work.

Caroline frowned. "You think he’s still hung up on her?"

"I don’t know." Evelyn stared into her wine. "But something’s off."

Before Caroline could respond, Evelyn’s phone lit up—a message from an unknown number.

"We need to talk. It’s about Nathaniel. —I.D."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

Isabella Davis.

The past had just crashed into her present.

Evelyn hadn't slept a wink waiting for Nathaniel's return. She watched through bleary eyes as dawn's pale fingers crept across the sky outside her window.

Nathaniel finally stepped through their apartment door at seven fifteen in the morning. The moment the lock clicked, Evelyn sat bolt upright in bed. His familiar footsteps approached their bedroom, and when the door swung open, their gazes locked instantly. Without a word, he crossed the room and enveloped her in his strong embrace.

She pressed her lips together, suppressing a relieved sigh as she melted into his arms. The scent of his cologne - bergamot and sandalwood - instantly calmed her frayed nerves.

"You didn't sleep at all, did you?" Nathaniel murmured against her hair.

"I dozed a little," Evelyn lied, hating how transparent she must seem. The truth was, sleep terrified her now. Every time she closed her eyes, the nightmares came hunting.

Nathaniel tilted her chin up, his storm-gray eyes searching hers. "Stay with me? I'm exhausted from the red-eye flight."

How could she refuse when he looked at her like that?

With Nathaniel's steady breathing beside her, the gnawing fear in Evelyn's chest eased slightly. She curled against him, absorbing his warmth, and finally drifted off.

The moment her breathing evened out, Nathaniel carefully extricated himself. He grabbed his phone from the nightstand, casting a worried glance at Evelyn's sleeping form before settling on the leather armchair by the window.

His fingers flew across the screen: [Evelyn's been having horrific nightmares. Any medical explanation?]

Dr. Harrison replied within minutes: [Stress or anxiety usually triggers night terrors. Has she been under unusual pressure?]

Nathaniel's jaw tightened as he typed: [Could it be physiological?]

[Unlikely. Dreams stem from the subconscious.]

But Nathaniel's gut told him otherwise. He spent the next twenty minutes researching sleep disorders, but every article echoed the doctor's opinion.

He didn't trust textbook answers. Nathaniel Martin only believed what he could see, touch, prove. Yet he couldn't dismiss Evelyn's terror as mere imagination - not when she'd been perfectly fine before his business trip.

A bloodcurdling scream shattered his thoughts.

"Nathaniel!" Evelyn thrashed wildly, sheets tangling around her legs.

He was at her side in an instant, gripping her shoulders. "Evelyn! Wake up, love. It's just a dream."

Her eyes flew open, pupils dilated with primal fear. When he reached for her, she recoiled violently. "Don't touch me!" she gasped.

Nathaniel froze. He'd never seen Evelyn like this - her porcelain skin gone ghostly pale, trembling hands clutching the sheets like a lifeline.

"It was here again," she whispered hoarsely. "That... thing."

"Sweetheart, it was just a nightmare." He kept his voice deliberately calm, though his pulse raced. "You're safe now."

Evelyn shook her head wildly. "No, you don't understand! I felt its breath on my neck. It's real, Nathaniel. It's following me."

The raw terror in her voice sent chills down his spine. Slowly, giving her time to refuse, he gathered her into his arms. This time, she clung to him like a drowning woman, her fingers twisting in his shirt.

They stayed like that for long minutes before Nathaniel gently suggested, "Tell me about the dream. Sometimes saying it aloud takes away its power."

Evelyn shuddered against him. "I can't. Just thinking about it makes my skin crawl." She pulled back slightly, searching his face with haunted eyes. "Do you believe me? Really believe me?"
###Chapter 292

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort in the Maldives. The design was ambitious, but she thrived on challenges.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Gabrielle, her assistant, peeked in. "Evelyn, Mr. Wilson is here to see you."

Evelyn nodded. "Send him in."

Gregory Wilson strode in, his usual confident demeanor slightly off. He dropped into the chair opposite her, running a hand through his hair. "We have a problem."

She arched a brow. "What kind of problem?"

"The investors for the Maldives project are getting cold feet. They're worried about the timeline."

Evelyn leaned back, tapping her pen against the desk. "We've accounted for every possible delay. What's really bothering them?"

Gregory hesitated. "Rumors. Someone's been whispering that Martin Group is overextending itself, that Nathaniel might pull funding."

Her grip on the pen tightened. "That's ridiculous."

"Is it?" Gregory met her gaze. "You know how the business world loves to talk. And with Isabella back in town..."

Evelyn's jaw clenched. Isabella Davis—Nathaniel's ex, the woman who had once held his heart. Her sudden return had stirred old ghosts.

"I'll handle it," Evelyn said firmly.

Gregory sighed. "Just be careful. The last thing we need is a scandal."

After he left, Evelyn stared at the blueprints, but her mind was elsewhere. She reached for her phone, thumb hovering over Nathaniel's contact. Then she stopped.

No. She wouldn't let doubt creep in.

Instead, she dialed another number. "Caroline? I need a favor."

Her cousin's cheerful voice came through. "Name it."

"Dig up everything you can on Isabella's recent activities. There's something she's not telling us."

Caroline chuckled. "Already on it. You really think she's up to something?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a determined smile. "I know she is."

As she hung up, the office door burst open again. This time, it was Nathaniel himself, his expression unreadable.

"We need to talk," he said, his voice low.

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "About?"

He stepped closer, his gaze intense. "About why you didn’t tell me Isabella contacted you."

The air between them crackled with tension. Evelyn held his stare, refusing to back down. "Because it wasn’t important."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Everything about her is important right now. She’s not here by coincidence, Evelyn."

A chill ran down her spine. "What do you mean?"

He exhaled sharply. "She’s after something. And until we figure out what, we’re both at risk."

Evelyn’s mind raced. The investors, the rumors, Isabella’s sudden reappearance—it was all connected.

And she was right in the middle of it.

The game had just begun.

"Of course." Nathaniel's voice was soft as he stroked Evelyn's hair. "If it's too painful, don't force yourself to remember. Just breathe. I'm right here with you, always."

Evelyn gave a faint nod, but her shoulders remained tense, her fingers twisting the edge of her sweater.

A long silence stretched between them before she suddenly whispered, "Nathaniel... do you hear that?"

His grip on her tightened. "Hear what?"

"A baby... crying."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. He cupped her face, forcing her to meet his gaze. "Evelyn, look at me. You're awake now. Tell me—who am I?"

Her eyes darted away, unfocused. The shadows beneath them were deep, her skin unnaturally pale.

At that moment, Nathaniel knew—something was very wrong.

He stayed by her side until Rosalind arrived to prepare lunch. Only then did he gently disentangle himself. "I need to check on Beatrice. She'll worry if we don't visit. Will you be alright?"

Evelyn nodded absently.

After updating Beatrice on the upcoming hospital tests, Nathaniel hesitated. "Has anyone... unusual come by to see Evelyn recently?"

Beatrice frowned. "No. Why?"

"She hasn't been sleeping well. Nightmares."

"Then stay close, Nathaniel. She needs you now more than ever."

"I know."

Beatrice patted his hand, reassured by his devotion.

Meanwhile, Evelyn sat motionless on the sofa, the television's glow flickering across her hollow expression. She wasn't watching. Wasn't really seeing anything at all.

Rosalind emerged from the kitchen, concern knitting her brow. "Ms. Mitchell, you look exhausted. Are you feeling unwell?"

Evelyn blinked slowly. "Just... bad dreams."

Rosalind pressed a glass of water into her hands. "You must rest. The baby—"

"I know." Evelyn took a sip, then noticed Rosalind fidgeting. "What is it?"

The cook hesitated. "Ms. Mitchell... I've decided to resign."

"Resign?" Evelyn's grip tightened on the glass. "But you said you liked working here. Is it the pay?"

"No! It's not that." Rosalind twisted her apron. "It's just... How long have you lived here?"

Confused, Evelyn answered.

Rosalind lowered her voice. "I overheard something in the elevator. They said... a pregnant girl killed herself in this apartment. Seven months along. Her family refused to accept the baby, so she... burned charcoal."

Evelyn's blood turned to ice.

###Chapter 293

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort in the Maldives. The design was ambitious, but she thrived on challenges.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Come in," she called without looking up.

Gabrielle, her assistant, stepped inside, holding a steaming cup of coffee. "You've been at this since dawn," she remarked, placing the cup beside Evelyn. "Thought you might need this."

Evelyn smiled gratefully. "You're a lifesaver."

Gabrielle hesitated, then added, "Mr. Wilson called earlier. He wants to discuss the Summit Realty proposal before the meeting this afternoon."

Evelyn sighed, rubbing her temples. Gregory had been relentless about securing the deal, but something about Edward Wilson's sudden interest in their firm didn't sit right with her.

"I'll handle it," she said, taking a sip of coffee. The rich aroma grounded her, sharpening her focus.

Just then, her phone buzzed—a message from Nathaniel.

"Dinner tonight? I have something to tell you."

Her heart skipped a beat. Nathaniel had been unusually distant lately, buried in work and late-night meetings. She typed a quick reply.

"Of course. 8 PM at La Perle?"

His response was immediate. "Perfect. See you then."

Evelyn set the phone down, her mind racing. What could he want to talk about?

Gabrielle cleared her throat. "Oh, and Caroline called. She said it's urgent."

Evelyn frowned. Caroline rarely used the word urgent. "I'll call her back."

As Gabrielle left, Evelyn dialed her cousin's number.

Caroline picked up on the first ring. "Evelyn, you need to see this."

"What is it?"

"I just ran into Isabella at the hospital. She was meeting with Dr. Harrison."

Evelyn's grip tightened on the phone. "Why?"

Caroline lowered her voice. "I don’t know, but she looked... nervous. And she was holding an envelope."

A cold knot formed in Evelyn's stomach. Isabella had been nothing but trouble since she reappeared in Nathaniel's life.

"Thanks for letting me know," Evelyn said quietly.

Hanging up, she stared at the blueprints, but her thoughts were elsewhere.

Something was coming.

And she wasn’t sure she was ready for it.

She hesitated for a long moment before speaking. "Evelyn, none of that is real. I checked this apartment thoroughly before moving in. It's brand new—no one has ever lived here before."

"But those people sounded so certain," Rosalind insisted, her voice trembling. "Mrs. Martin, I'm particularly sensitive to these things. A pregnant woman's energy is already different from others, let alone one who... took her own life..."

She trailed off, too afraid to finish.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Rosalind, these are just rumors. Don't let them get to you. If you really want to leave, at least wait until I find a replacement, alright?"

Reluctantly, Rosalind agreed, promising to stay until then.

After preparing dinner, Rosalind left quickly. Alone, Evelyn curled up on the sofa, her gaze drifting around the empty apartment. Despite her earlier dismissal, Rosalind's words clung to her like a shadow.

The more she thought about it, the heavier the unease in her chest grew. By the time Nathaniel returned, she was nearly convinced.

But why was she the only one having nightmares? Nathaniel slept soundly beside her every night, and Rosalind had never mentioned anything unusual.

Just as her thoughts spiraled, the front door clicked open.

Evelyn jolted, her pulse racing—until Nathaniel stepped inside.

"Did I startle you?" he asked softly, frowning at her tense posture.

She didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she recounted Rosalind’s unsettling claims. "I’ve been having nightmares, Nathaniel. And now this... I’m scared."

His expression darkened. "It’s nothing. Just superstition." He cupped her face gently. "Let’s go for a walk. Fresh air will help."

She agreed. After dinner, they strolled through the neighborhood, but Evelyn couldn’t shake the feeling that passersby were watching her—their gazes filled with something like pity.

Her grip on Nathaniel’s arm tightened. "Do you see how they’re looking at me?"

He followed her line of sight, then shook his head. "No one’s staring, Evelyn. You’re imagining things."

"Am I?" She bit her lip. The whispers in her mind grew louder.

Nathaniel turned her to face him. "Trust me. There’s nothing wrong."

She wanted to believe him. But doubt had already taken root.

That night, Nathaniel called Samuel to investigate. The results were shocking.

"Mr. Martin," Samuel reported over speakerphone, "Rosalind previously worked for the Mitchell family but resigned two years ago due to health issues. The family compensated her generously. She only returned to work six months ago—shortly after meeting Sophia."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. "That can’t be true."

But the pieces were falling into place.

And none of them led anywhere good.



###Chapter 294

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a golden glow over the bedroom. Evelyn stirred, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work, leaving only the faint scent of his cologne lingering in the air.

She stretched, her muscles protesting slightly from last night’s events. The gala had been exhausting, but necessary—another step in securing the Martin Group’s latest venture. Still, the weight of unspoken tensions hung between them, a shadow neither had addressed.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Gregory: "Meeting moved to 10. The investors want revisions before signing."

Evelyn sighed. Another last-minute change. She typed a quick reply before tossing the phone aside.

Downstairs, Alfred had already prepared breakfast—fresh fruit, avocado toast, and a steaming cup of Earl Grey. The quiet of the villa was a stark contrast to the chaos of the city beyond its gates.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin," Alfred greeted, setting down a folded newspaper beside her plate.

"Morning, Alfred," she murmured, flipping through the headlines. Her gaze snagged on a familiar name—Isabella Davis Returns to the Spotlight—accompanied by a glossy photo of Nathaniel’s ex, radiant in a designer gown.

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the paper. Isabella had been absent for months, and now, suddenly, she was everywhere. Coincidence? She doubted it.

Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was Nathaniel.

"Running late. Dinner tonight?"

She hesitated, then replied, "If you’re free."

The response was immediate. "I’ll make time."

Evelyn exhaled, setting the phone down. She had a full day ahead—meetings, deadlines, and now, the gnawing suspicion that Isabella’s return was anything but innocent.

But first, coffee.

She took a long sip, steeling herself. Whatever game was being played, she wouldn’t lose. Not again.

She refused to believe this had any connection to Sophia or the Mitchells. "Even if the Mitchell family hasn't treated me well," Evelyn thought, "they wouldn't go this far... would they?"

Nathaniel's brow furrowed, his expression grave.

Shaking her head, Evelyn murmured to him, "I need... just a moment alone."

Nathaniel gave a curt nod, watching as she rose unsteadily. She meant to retreat to their bedroom, but Angie's venomous words echoed in her mind. Instead, she drifted toward the living room balcony.

Nathaniel's voice was ice when he spoke to Samuel. "Monitor her. I want updates constantly."

"Understood, Mr. Martin."

The call ended abruptly. Nathaniel's jaw clenched, storm clouds gathering in his eyes.

He allowed Evelyn ten minutes—no more. When time was up, he found her curled in the patio chair, small and drained. His hand brushed her hair. "Talk to me," he urged.

"I can't reconcile this with the Mitchells," she whispered. "Am I being naive? Or is there some mistake?"

The Mitchells knew about her pregnancy. Harming her now would alienate not just Evelyn, but the entire Martin dynasty.

Nathaniel's frown deepened. "Samuel's investigation will uncover the truth."

Evelyn nodded weakly. He guided her inside, but as she stood—

Darkness swallowed her whole.

—

Hospital lights stung Evelyn's eyes as consciousness returned. Nathaniel stood silhouetted against the window, phone pressed to his ear. Seeing her stir, he ended the call instantly.

"How do you feel?" His thumb traced her cheekbone.

"What... happened?"

"You collapsed. Doctors say stress and exhaustion." His gaze held hers, unflinching. "But you're stable now."

Evelyn threw back the sheets. "I want to leave."

"Nathaniel caught her wrist. His voice roughened. "Two days' observation. Mandatory."

"Why?"

A beat of silence. Then: "Rosalind laced your food with teratogens and hallucinogens. You've eaten little, so exposure was minimal. But we're running full fetal scans to be certain."

He'd intended to shield her from this truth. But when the ER doctors had whispered their findings, Nathaniel nearly sent Samuel to drag the Mitchells there by their hair. Only decades of discipline had stayed his hand.

Evelyn's breath hitched. "The baby—"

"Will be fine." He cradled her face. "Dr. Harrison's overseeing everything personally."

Two interminable days passed in that sterile room. The Martins enforced total secrecy.

Every second tormented Evelyn. Between fearing for her child and dreading the Mitchells' potential involvement, her mind became a broken record:

What if it's true?

What then?

The Martin Marriage (Evelyn and Nathaniel) novel

###Chapter 295

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the new resort design, a project that had consumed her thoughts for weeks.

A soft knock interrupted her concentration. "Come in," she called, not looking up.

Gabrielle, her assistant, stepped inside with a tray of coffee. "You've been at it since dawn, Evelyn. Thought you could use this."

Evelyn finally glanced up, offering a tired but grateful smile. "Thanks, Gabrielle. I just want to make sure everything’s perfect before the client meeting."

Gabrielle hesitated, then added, "Nathaniel called earlier. He said he’d be late tonight—another board meeting."

Evelyn’s smile faltered slightly. Lately, Nathaniel had been buried under the weight of Martin Group’s expansion, their time together dwindling. "I figured," she murmured, taking a sip of the coffee.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Charlotte. "Girl, we need to talk. Coffee later?"

Evelyn exhaled. A distraction might be exactly what she needed.

Across town, Nathaniel leaned back in his chair, rubbing his temples as the board members argued over the latest acquisition. His father, Richard, sat at the head of the table, his expression unreadable.

"We can’t afford delays," Richard stated coolly. "The investors are getting restless."

Nathaniel clenched his jaw. "Rushing this will only lead to mistakes. We need more time."

His father’s gaze sharpened. "Time is a luxury we don’t have."

A familiar tension settled in Nathaniel’s chest. The weight of expectations, the unspoken comparisons to his grandfather—Edward Martin’s legacy loomed large.

Samuel, his secretary, slipped him a note. "Evelyn called. She’s meeting Charlotte tonight."

Nathaniel frowned. He’d promised to be home early. Again, he’d failed.

At the café, Evelyn stirred her latte absently as Charlotte studied her. "You look exhausted," Charlotte remarked.

Evelyn sighed. "Just... a lot going on."

Charlotte leaned in. "Is it Nathaniel?"

Evelyn hesitated. "He’s just... busy. Always busy."

Charlotte’s expression softened. "You know, my dad always says—when work becomes the priority, relationships suffer."

Evelyn’s grip tightened around her cup. She knew Charlotte was right. But how could she ask Nathaniel to choose between his family’s empire and their marriage?

Her phone buzzed again—a message from Gregory. "Client moved the meeting to tomorrow. Get some rest."

Relief washed over her. Maybe she’d surprise Nathaniel at the office.

Nathaniel stood by the window, staring at the city lights. The board meeting had dragged on, leaving him drained.

The door creaked open. "Still here?"

He turned to find Evelyn leaning against the frame, a small smile playing on her lips.

His heart lifted. "What are you doing here?"

She stepped closer. "Thought you could use a break."

For the first time in weeks, Nathaniel felt the tension ease. He pulled her into his arms, breathing in the familiar scent of her perfume. "I’m sorry," he murmured.

Evelyn rested her head against his chest. "We’ll figure it out."

Outside, the city hummed with life, but in that moment, nothing else mattered.

Before Evelyn could unravel the mystery, Nathaniel arrived.

Samuel approached with his findings, delivering them with professional precision. "Mr. Martin, Mrs. Martin, I've confirmed that Rosalind's connection to Sophia stems from Sophia funding her son's master's degree."

Evelyn's brows furrowed. "So, this has no ties to the Mitchells?"

"Correct. I conducted a separate investigation into the Mitchell family's dealings with Rosalind. Aside from Sophia, there were no interactions."

Relief washed over Evelyn. The thought of her own family being involved had weighed heavily on her heart. She turned to Samuel, frustration lacing her voice. "If this isn't personal, and the Mitchells aren't involved, why would Rosalind target me?"

"Mrs. Martin," Samuel explained, "while the Mitchells aren't connected, Rosalind accepted payment to drug your meal and spread those lies deliberately."

The identity of the benefactor remained elusive. Transactions had been conducted through encrypted messages on WhatsApp, making tracing difficult. The only certainty? Whoever was behind this knew Evelyn and Nathaniel intimately.

Otherwise, they wouldn’t have timed it so precisely—when Nathaniel was away on business.

Evelyn fell silent for a long moment before asking, "Where is Rosalind now?"

"In police custody. All evidence has been submitted."

Nathaniel dismissed Samuel with a gesture, then turned to Evelyn. "Don’t you want her to face consequences?"

Evelyn shook her head. "No. I just... I need to ask her why. As a mother, how could she do this knowing I was pregnant?"

But even as the words left her lips, she realized some people wore kindness as a mask while committing cruelty. She didn’t press further, leaving the matter in Nathaniel’s hands.

Rosalind would answer to the law. Meanwhile, Nathaniel ensured Sophia learned exactly what kind of person she had been supporting.

Two days in the hospital passed under Dr. Harrison’s watchful eye. Thankfully, both Evelyn and the baby were unharmed. Still, Dr. Harrison pulled Nathaniel aside before discharge.

"Schedule regular checkups. Everything looks good now, but we can’t afford complacency. No need to worry Evelyn unnecessarily."

Nathaniel agreed.

He stayed by Evelyn’s side throughout, tending to her with unwavering devotion, determined to restore her peace of mind.

Once home, the storm seemed to pass—yet Evelyn’s heart refused to settle.

She gripped Nathaniel’s hand, resolve hardening in her voice. "I need to know who did this. I have to."

Nathaniel cupped her face, his gaze steady. "I promise you, I won’t stop until we find them. Every lead, every shadow—I’ll chase them all."

A faint smile touched her lips.

To distract her, Nathaniel retrieved a file Samuel had prepared weeks prior and handed it to her. "Take a look. Might interest you."

Evelyn flipped it open. The rules for the upcoming architects’ competition, sponsored by Martin Group, stared back at her.

Nathaniel’s lips curved. "Your expertise. Care to give it a shot?"

Instead of admitting she’d already begun preparations, Evelyn arched a brow playfully. "Do you think I can?"



###Chapter 296

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden streaks across her blueprints. She tapped her pen against the desk, lost in thought. The Pineview Villa project was nearing completion, but something felt off.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Nathaniel.

"Meeting at the estate. Edward wants to discuss the final details."

Evelyn sighed. Edward Martin had been more involved than usual lately, scrutinizing every decision. She grabbed her bag and headed out, nodding at Gabrielle on her way.

The drive to the Martin estate was quiet, the hum of the engine the only sound. When she arrived, Winston greeted her at the door with his usual stoic expression.

"Mr. Martin is waiting in the study," he said.

Evelyn walked down the familiar hallway, her heels clicking softly against the marble. The door to the study was slightly ajar. She pushed it open.

Nathaniel stood by the fireplace, his back to her. Edward sat in his favorite armchair, his sharp gaze fixed on her the moment she entered.

"Ah, Evelyn. Right on time," Edward said, gesturing to the empty seat across from him.

She sat, folding her hands in her lap. "You wanted to discuss the project?"

Edward leaned forward. "I’ve been reviewing the final designs. There’s a change I’d like to make."

Nathaniel turned, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn tensed. "What kind of change?"

Edward smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes. "The east wing. I want it redesigned."

Her stomach dropped. The east wing was nearly finished. "That would set us back weeks—"

"I’m aware," Edward interrupted. "But I believe it’s necessary."

Nathaniel finally spoke, his voice low. "Grandfather, we’ve already approved the plans."

Edward waved a dismissive hand. "Plans can be adjusted. I want something more... grand."

Evelyn clenched her jaw. This wasn’t about design. It was a test.

She met Edward’s gaze. "I’ll need to reassess the structural feasibility."

Edward nodded, satisfied. "Good. I expect revisions by the end of the week."

As Evelyn left the study, Nathaniel followed her out.

"He’s pushing you," he murmured.

She exhaled sharply. "I know."

Nathaniel hesitated, then reached for her hand. "We’ll figure it out."

Evelyn squeezed his fingers, but her mind was already racing. Edward’s sudden demand wasn’t just about the villa.

Something bigger was at play.

"What? Don't tell me you're doubting yourself now?"

"Of course not."

"Then why hesitate to sign up?"

Nathaniel's gaze was expectant, waiting for her agreement.

Evelyn smirked. "Nathaniel, you're late to the party."

"What?"

"I made my decision days ago. Your invitation came after the fact."

She shot him a knowing look. As for the competition rules he'd mentioned? She'd memorized them long before he brought them up.

Nathaniel frowned. "Why didn’t you mention it?"

"Because it’s company business, Nathaniel. I could’ve kept it entirely from you—it’s confidential, isn’t it?" Her lips curved into a teasing smile as she tilted her head.

His eyes darkened. "So you planned to hide it indefinitely?"

"Who knows? Maybe I’d have bragged about it after winning."

"Fine. I’ll wait."

His immediate agreement caught her off guard—as if her victory were already guaranteed.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "You really think I can win?"

"Do you want to?"

"Doesn’t every contestant?"

"But you have an advantage." His fingers brushed her cheek, his voice dropping to a murmur. "Interested in taking a shortcut?"

Evelyn feigned innocence. "What kind of shortcut?"

"Can’t you see it?" His thumb traced her jawline. "It’s right in front of you."

"Are you suggesting I bribe you?"

His arms wrapped around her waist, pulling her flush against him. "Evelyn," he murmured, lips grazing her ear, "the opportunity’s here. All you need to do is persuade me."

She laughed. "Mr. Martin, what could I possibly offer? You already have everything."

"Then get creative."

"Spell it out for me." She arched a brow, amusement dancing in her eyes.

Nathaniel’s smirk deepened. "Flattery might work."

"That’s all it takes to bribe you?"

"Try it and see."

She pretended to consider it before shaking her head. "No deal."

His grip tightened. "Giving up so easily? Didn’t anyone teach you persistence?"

"Oh, they did. But they also warned me that anything too easily gained isn’t worth having. If the title comes that cheap, it’s not a real victory. I’d rather earn it."

Her tone was serious, but the playful glint in her eyes betrayed her. Before she could react, Nathaniel cupped her face and captured her lips in a searing kiss.

That moment marked a shift—Evelyn’s reliance on Nathaniel grew, their bond deepening without either realizing it.

Once fully recovered, Evelyn threw herself into competition preparations. But Nathaniel wasn’t done investigating.

Unbeknownst to her, he’d already scrutinized the Mitchell family. While Evelyn trusted them implicitly, Nathaniel trusted only evidence. The findings? The Mitchells were clean.

Now, new leads had surfaced. Samuel had been tasked with following them, and the results were due any moment.

Just then, the office door swung open.

Samuel entered, uncharacteristically tense, clutching a manila envelope. "Mr. Martin," he said quietly, "the investigator just delivered these—photos and surveillance footage."

He placed the envelope on the desk, sliding it toward Nathaniel.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened as he glanced at it. "What did you find?"



###Chapter 297

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, illuminating the blueprints spread across her desk. Her fingers traced the intricate lines of the latest project—a luxury resort that could redefine Martin Group's portfolio.

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. "Evelyn, you have a visitor," Gabrielle announced, stepping aside to reveal Nathaniel standing in the doorway.

Her breath hitched. Even after all this time, his presence still sent a jolt through her. Dressed in a tailored navy suit, his dark eyes locked onto hers with an intensity that made her pulse quicken.

"I thought we could have lunch," he said, his voice smooth yet laced with something unreadable.

Evelyn hesitated. Their relationship had been a whirlwind of emotions—love, betrayal, reconciliation. But lately, the distance between them had grown, filled with unspoken words and lingering doubts.

"Just lunch?" she asked, arching a brow.

Nathaniel smirked, stepping closer. "Unless you'd prefer something more... private."

Heat crept up her neck, but she forced a composed smile. "Lunch is fine."

As they left the office, Evelyn couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn't just about food. There was a tension in the air, a silent storm brewing beneath Nathaniel's calm exterior.

The restaurant he chose was elegant, secluded—a place where conversations could remain unheard. Over glasses of wine, he finally broached the subject she'd been dreading.

"We need to talk about Isabella."

Evelyn's grip tightened around her glass. Isabella Davis—Nathaniel's ex, the woman who had once threatened to tear them apart.

"What about her?" Evelyn kept her tone neutral, though her heart pounded.

Nathaniel leaned forward, his expression serious. "She's back in town. And she's not here to play nice."

A chill ran down Evelyn's spine. The past was catching up to them, and this time, she wasn't sure if their love could survive the storm.

As the waiter approached with their meals, Nathaniel's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his jaw tightening.

"We have a problem," he muttered.

Evelyn didn't need to ask. The look in his eyes said it all.

Isabella had already made her move.

And the game was far from over.

Nathaniel's gaze darkened as he lowered his head, his voice softening. "You're right. This situation does involve Isabella Davis."

A dangerous glint flickered in Nathaniel's eyes, his handsome features hardening with icy hostility. The silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating.

The office air turned heavy, charged with unspoken tension.

Samuel waited, his pulse quickening, before daring to ask, "Mr. Martin, should we report this to the authorities?"

"No." Nathaniel's response was sharp, his tone leaving no room for argument. He dismissed Samuel with a wave of his hand. "Keep this quiet for now. Recall the team—no further investigation."

Samuel nodded. "Understood, sir."

Once alone, Nathaniel's attention returned to the photograph in his grasp. The longer he stared, the deeper the shadows in his expression grew, masking whatever turmoil churned beneath.

He didn't bother finishing. With a flick of his wrist, he shoved the image back into its envelope and tossed it into the farthest corner of his desk drawer.

A cigarette found its way between his fingers. As smoke curled around him, his sharp features turned colder, more unreadable.

After exhaling a slow drag, he pressed the intercom. "Samuel."

The door opened moments later. "Sir?"

"Rotate surveillance on her every ten days. She can't suspect a thing. Monitor every contact she makes." Nathaniel's voice was steel. "If anything feels off, replace the operative immediately."

"Of course." Samuel hesitated. "Should we... intervene? Send a warning?"

"Not yet. We don't know her endgame. Acting now would tip our hand."

"But—"

Nathaniel's gaze snapped up, silencing him.

Samuel swallowed. "Apologies, sir. I overstepped."

Nathaniel exhaled, his voice dropping to a murmur. "Handle this discreetly. Evelyn cannot find out. Not until we know what Isabella is planning. One misstep, and this spirals."

Samuel dipped his head in acknowledgment before retreating.

Alone again, Nathaniel leaned back in his chair, fingers steepled. A single thought echoed: If Evelyn discovers this, will she ever forgive me?

His eyes darkened further, clouded like a storm with no end.

Just as he reached for his phone to call Evelyn, the door burst open—Samuel, uncharacteristically frantic.

Nathaniel's brow furrowed. "What now?"

No knock. No warning.

Samuel thrust a tablet forward. The headline blared: MITCHELL GROUP IN FREE FALL.

"Sir, urgent news. William Mitchell's company is collapsing. Debt collectors swarmed them. He started mass layoffs, but two employees—they jumped from the rooftop."

The Mitchell Group had been drowning for years, barely staying afloat.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Are they alive?"

"Rescue teams are still working. Initial reports say they hit a solar panel barrier on the way down. Critical, but stable."

A small mercy. Still, the damage was done. The media had already painted the Mitchell name in blood.

Nathaniel was already moving, snapping orders. "Get the car. We're picking up Evelyn."

His phone was at his ear before he crossed the threshold.

Evelyn answered on the second ring, her voice eerily calm. "You're calling an hour early. Getting reckless, Mr. Martin?"



###Chapter 298

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the penthouse, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. Evelyn stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. Nathaniel had already left for work, as usual.

She sighed, rolling onto her back and staring at the intricate ceiling design she had sketched years ago. The memory of their first argument over it flashed in her mind—how stubborn he had been, insisting on a more traditional approach, while she had fought for something modern and bold.

Her phone buzzed, snapping her out of her thoughts. A message from Gregory lit up the screen:

"Meeting at 10. Client wants revisions. Again."

Evelyn groaned. The Kensington project had been dragging on for months, with the client changing their mind every other week. She tossed the phone aside and swung her legs over the edge of the bed.

Downstairs, Alfred was setting breakfast on the terrace. The scent of freshly brewed coffee and buttery croissants filled the air.

"Good morning, Mrs. Martin," he greeted with a slight bow.

"Morning, Alfred," she murmured, rubbing her temples.

"Mr. Martin left early. He mentioned a board meeting."

Evelyn nodded absently, stirring her coffee. She didn’t need to ask—Nathaniel’s schedule was always packed. Between the Martin Group’s expansion and his grandfather’s relentless expectations, he barely had time to breathe.

Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was Isabella.

"We need to talk. It’s urgent."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the phone. Isabella had been a ghost from the past, resurfacing at the worst possible moments. She had no idea what the woman wanted now, but she wasn’t in the mood for games.

Ignoring the message, she scrolled through her emails instead. One from Summit Realty caught her eye—Sebastian Wilson, their CEO, requesting a meeting to discuss a potential collaboration.

Interesting.

She tapped her fingers against the table, considering. A new project might be exactly what she needed to distract herself from the mess at work—and whatever drama Isabella was about to stir up.

But first, she had to deal with Gregory and the never-ending Kensington revisions.

With a deep breath, she finished her coffee and stood. The day was just beginning, and she already felt exhausted.

Little did she know, the real storm was yet to come.

Nathaniel's brow furrowed slightly. "I'm the CEO, and so are you. Can't we call it a day early?"

"Mr. Martin, my firm isn't as large as yours. I can't afford to be as whimsical," Evelyn countered, her tone dry.

"I'm already on my way out. Be downstairs in ten minutes, alright?" Nathaniel didn’t leave room for hesitation.

Evelyn exhaled softly before murmuring, "Fine." Then, hesitating, she added, "Are you worried I’ll stress over the Mitchell family’s situation?"

"Let’s discuss it in person."

"Alright."

Hanging up, Evelyn clutched her phone for a moment, then quietly sighed. She turned back to her desk, packed her laptop, and slung her bag over her shoulder.

Just as she stepped out of her office, she nearly collided with Gregory, who was heading her way. His eyebrows lifted. "Leaving already?"

"Something came up."

"Is it about the Mitchells?"

Evelyn nodded. The scandal had been plastered across every financial outlet—there was no avoiding it.

Gregory’s expression darkened. "What’s your plan? Maybe you should talk to Nathaniel about reinstating the partnership. That could pull the Mitchell Group out of this mess."

Evelyn’s lips thinned. "Gregory, do you really think a single collaboration with the Martins will magically fix everything?"

"Of course. Isn’t that obvious?"

She shook her head, a wry smile touching her lips. "It’s not that simple. If the Mitchell Group collapses just because they lost one partner, then their foundation was never stable to begin with. A corporation should stand on its own—not crumble without external support."

Her voice had risen without her realizing it, frustration bleeding through. Catching herself, she lowered her gaze. "Sorry. I didn’t mean to snap."

Gregory waved it off. "No, you’re right. I was oversimplifying things. I just thought it’d be easier to address the deeper issues after stabilizing their immediate crisis."

"I get it. But the Mitchell Group’s problems aren’t new. They’ve been buried for years. No single deal will erase that."

Before she could continue, her phone buzzed in her bag. She pulled it out, glanced at the screen, and declined the call without hesitation.

"I should go," she said, offering Gregory a tight smile.

"Of course. And Evelyn—if you need anything, just ask. We’re friends. No need to hold back."

"Thanks." With that, she strode past him, unaware of the shadow that crossed his face the moment her back was turned.

The elevator ride down was silent. Outside, Nathaniel’s car idled at the curb. Samuel stepped out promptly, opening the rear door for her.

Sliding in, Nathaniel arched a brow. "You took your time."

"Got held up talking." She didn’t elaborate, rubbing her temple briefly before turning to him. "What do you think really caused the Mitchell Group’s downfall?"



###Chapter 299

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Evelyn's office, casting golden patterns across her drafting table. She tapped her pencil absently against the blueprint, her mind elsewhere. The soft hum of the city outside barely registered as she replayed last night's conversation with Nathaniel for the hundredth time.

A sharp knock startled her. "Evelyn?" Gabrielle poked her head in, holding a steaming mug. "Thought you could use this. You've been staring at that same page for forty minutes."

Evelyn accepted the coffee with a grateful smile. The rich aroma of espresso momentarily cleared her thoughts. "Thanks. Just... working through some design complications."

Gabrielle arched an eyebrow but wisely didn't press. "Gregory wants to see you in Conference Room B. Something about the waterfront project."

Evelyn's stomach tightened. The Martin Group's latest development—Nathaniel's pet project. She'd deliberately avoided working on it since... everything happened. "Tell him I'll be there in five."

As Gabrielle left, Evelyn's phone buzzed. A text from Nathaniel: We need to talk. Dinner tonight?

Her fingers hovered over the screen. Three weeks of polite distance since Isabella's bombshell revelation about the pregnancy. Three weeks of sleepless nights analyzing every interaction, every glance, every unspoken word between them.

She typed Okay, then deleted it. Started again: I have late meetings. Deleted that too. Finally settled on: Where?

His reply came instantly: Our place. 8pm.

Our place. The penthouse they'd bought together last spring, with its panoramic views of the city skyline. Where they'd hosted dinner parties and spent lazy Sunday mornings tangled in silk sheets. Where she'd found Isabella's earring on the guest room pillow that fateful morning.

Evelyn swallowed hard and pocketed her phone. Whatever Nathaniel wanted to discuss, it would change everything. Again.

Down the hall, muffled voices spilled from Conference Room B. Gregory stood at the head of the table, gesturing animatedly at renderings spread across the surface. He broke off when Evelyn entered. "There you are. We've hit a snag with the zoning permits."

Evelyn forced herself to focus as Gregory explained the issue. But her attention snagged on the project name emblazoned across the documents: Martin Harborfront Development. Nathaniel's signature bold font. Her chest constricted.

"...which means we'll need to completely redesign the west wing," Gregory was saying. "Evelyn? Are you listening?"

She blinked. "Sorry. Jet lag." A weak excuse—she hadn't traveled anywhere. "Let me take another look at the schematics."

As she bent over the plans, the conference room door swung open. Evelyn glanced up—and froze.

Nathaniel stood in the doorway, impeccably dressed in a charcoal suit, his storm-gray eyes locking onto hers. "Am I interrupting?"

The air left Evelyn's lungs. He wasn't supposed to be here. Their dinner confrontation wasn't supposed to happen now, in front of colleagues, with her unprepared.

Gregory recovered first. "Mr. Martin! We were just discussing the zoning issues."

Nathaniel stepped inside, his presence filling the room. "I'm aware. That's why I'm here." His gaze never left Evelyn's face. "I thought we could solve this together."

Evelyn's fingers curled around the edge of the table. Together. The word hung between them, loaded with unspoken meaning. Did he still consider them a team? After everything?

The other architects shifted uncomfortably, sensing the tension. Gregory cleared his throat. "Well, uh, Evelyn's our lead on this. If you two want to... collaborate..."

"Perfect." Nathaniel moved to stand beside Evelyn, close enough that she caught his familiar scent—sandalwood and something uniquely him. "Shall we begin?"

Evelyn's pulse hammered in her throat. This wasn't just about zoning permits. This was a test. A reckoning. The first real conversation they'd have since their world imploded.

She inhaled sharply and reached for her pencil. "Let's begin."

Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn as he asked softly, "You truly didn't realize?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Perhaps I misread the situation."

Especially after her tense exchange with Gregory, doubt had crept into her mind.

Nathaniel leaned forward, his voice deceptively gentle. "Evelyn, deep down, you know the truth. The Mitchell Group has been clinging to outdated practices, relying too heavily on external support. Without innovation, collapse was inevitable. Their strategy was never sustainable. So tell me—was your judgment flawed, or was it accurate?"

Evelyn's breath hitched, her lashes fluttering. He had voiced the very thoughts plaguing her.

She fell silent. Nathaniel tilted his head. "Should I escort you to Mitchell Manor?"

"No," she said firmly.

William and Margaret wouldn’t welcome her presence now. She’d only worsen their turmoil.

By dawn, the Mitchell scandal dominated every major financial forum.

Mitchell Manor remained illuminated through the night, its occupants sleepless.

William sat chain-smoking in the parlor, while Margaret alternated between sobbing and pacing. "William, why don’t we beg Edward Martin for help?"

He crushed his cigarette, his voice hollow. "It’s pointless. The debts are insurmountable. The company’s structure is rotten..."

Margaret’s tears fell harder. "You keep saying that! How do you know unless we try? This is Evelyn’s doing! She failed us!"

"Enough!" William snapped, shoving past her. The front door slammed behind him.

Only Margaret and Sophia remained in the hollow silence.

Sophia had tried every avenue—calling Martin Manor, only for Winston to dismiss her, claiming Edward was indisposed.

She’d considered reaching out to Nathaniel directly but knew he’d never entertain her pleas.

Helplessness gnawed at her. Worse, her so-called friends vanished overnight, several blocking her outright.

A bitter realization struck: their loyalty had always been to the Mitchell name and its ties to the Martins.

Sophia stayed by Margaret’s side as the hours crawled by.

At sunrise, fresh chaos erupted.

Before the Mitchell Group’s layoff protests could settle, red paint splattered across the company’s entrance and Mitchell Manor’s gates, accompanied by a vicious slogan:

[Fraudulent Empire! Restore Our Livelihoods!]

The media pounced, dragging the family back into the spotlight.

William, who’d spent the night at his office, emerged haggard and bloodshot. Employees mobbed him, screaming for unpaid wages. Only his secretary, Victor Mills, managed to shield him long enough to reach the parking lot.

Inside the car, Victor delivered the sole shred of good news. "Sir, the two employees who jumped survived. Multiple fractures, but they’ll recover."

William rubbed his temples. "Compensate their families. We need to salvage the company’s reputation."

Victor hesitated. "They’re demanding three million each."

William’s head jerked up. "Six million total?"

The amount was impossible.

"The company’s reserves?" William rasped.

Victor’s voice dropped. "Barely three hundred thousand, sir."
###Chapter 300

The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Pineview Villa, casting golden streaks across the marble floors. Evelyn stood by the window, her fingers tracing the delicate rim of her coffee cup. The warmth seeped into her skin, but it did little to ease the tension coiling in her chest.

Nathaniel had left early—again.

She exhaled sharply, setting the cup down with a quiet clink. The silence of the villa was suffocating, broken only by the distant hum of the city below.

Her phone buzzed on the counter. A message from Gregory.

"Meeting at 10. Client wants revisions on the waterfront project. Think you can make it?"

Evelyn frowned. She had barely slept, her mind replaying last night’s argument with Nathaniel. His cold dismissal, the way he had turned away from her as if she were nothing more than an inconvenience.

She typed back quickly. "I’ll be there."

Before she could set the phone down, another notification flashed—Isabella Davis had posted a new photo.

Evelyn’s thumb hovered over the screen. She shouldn’t look. She knew she shouldn’t.

But she did.

The image was a candid shot of Isabella at some high-end gala, her emerald-green dress clinging to her curves, a champagne flute dangling from her fingers. And in the background, barely in focus but unmistakable—Nathaniel, his dark suit immaculate, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

The caption read: "Old flames and new beginnings. 🥂 #Throwback"

A bitter laugh escaped her. Of course. Just when she thought things couldn’t get worse, life had a way of proving her wrong.

She tossed the phone onto the couch and grabbed her coat. If she stayed here any longer, she’d drown in her own thoughts.

The city streets were alive with movement, the crisp autumn air biting at her cheeks. Evelyn walked without direction, her mind a whirlwind of doubts and fears.

Had she made a mistake marrying Nathaniel?

Was she just a placeholder until Isabella decided she wanted him back?

A hand suddenly gripped her arm, yanking her out of her thoughts.

"Evelyn?"

She turned to find Thomas Ellsworth, Nathaniel’s closest friend, staring at her with concern.

"You okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost."

She forced a smile. "Just lost in thought."

Thomas studied her for a moment before sighing. "Listen, I don’t know what’s going on between you and Nate, but—"

"But what?" Evelyn snapped, then immediately regretted it.

Thomas held up his hands. "But you deserve better than this."

The words struck her like a physical blow.

Because deep down, she knew he was right.

And that was the most terrifying realization of all.

Victor's voice cut through the tense silence. "Mr. William Mitchell, what about the funds the Martin Group transferred earlier?"

William's shoulders slumped as he answered, "That barely covered the interest on our other loans. Just the interest." His voice cracked under the weight of exhaustion. "So tell me, Victor, what now?"

The air grew heavier. William couldn't breathe—it felt like an invisible hand was crushing his chest. The relentless ringing of creditors' calls echoed in his skull, each one a hammer blow to his sanity. His vision blurred at the edges.

Victor glanced back when no reply came. "Mr. Mitchell? Should I take you home?"

Still nothing.

William had collapsed against the seat, unconscious.

The hospital lights were too bright.

Margaret and Sophia arrived in a panic, heels clicking against the sterile floor. "What happened?" Margaret demanded, her voice trembling. "Why is he like this?"

Sophia squeezed her mother's hand. "He'll be okay. We have to believe that."

Margaret bit her lip hard enough to draw blood, nodding mutely.

There was nothing else they could do but wait.

Half an hour later, the doctors wheeled William out. Stable—but no one could say when he'd wake up.

Sophia stayed with Margaret while she left to gather essentials from home. Before leaving, she fired off a text:

[Dad's in the hospital. If you still care about this family, come now.]

Evelyn's fork clattered onto her plate.

She stood so fast her chair nearly toppled. "I need to go."

Nathaniel caught her wrist. "What's wrong?"

"Sophia says Dad's hospitalized. It's bad."

He was already reaching for his keys.

They nearly collided with Beatrice at the door.

Her sharp eyes missed nothing. "The Mitchells are in trouble, and you didn't tell me?" Beatrice didn't own a smartphone, but the morning papers had been damning.

Evelyn kept it brief. "I'll handle it."

No mention of hospitals. No need to worry her grandmother further.

Beatrice simply nodded. "Go. But remember—family first."

Nathaniel went straight to Dr. Harrison's office while Evelyn headed for the ward.

She never made it past the doorway.

Margaret blocked her like a vengeful spirit. "Get out." The words were ice. "How dare you show your face here? This is your doing! If you'd lifted a finger to help, your father wouldn't be—"

A shove.

Nathaniel materialized between them, shielding Evelyn.

Evelyn met her mother's glare without flinching. "Stop me if you want. But Dad needs Dr. Harrison. Let him through."

Margaret knew Harrison's reputation. Knew he was William's best chance.

Rage won anyway.

"We don't want your pity," she spat. "If he dies, Evelyn, his blood is on your hands. You'll carry that guilt forever."

Evelyn's voice dropped to a whisper. "Really? You'd rather let him suffer than swallow your pride?" A beat. "Tell me, Mother—who's the real accomplice here?"

The heart monitor's steady beep was the only reply.
###Chapter 301
Severing Bonds

Evelyn's words ignited Margaret's fury. She jabbed a finger toward her daughter, voice trembling with rage. "You—Evelyn, I'm cutting all ties with you. From this moment, you are no longer my child!"

The declaration plunged the room into stunned silence.

Evelyn didn't flinch. Her expression remained unreadable as she met Margaret's glare. "If that's your choice, I won't stop you. But right now, the priority is letting Dr. Harrison examine Dad. If you refuse my help, I'll have him leave immediately."

Margaret's lips curled in disgust. "Ungrateful wretch. After everything we've done for you, this is how you repay us? I should've smothered you the day you were born."

A bitter smile touched Evelyn's lips. "You should have. But since you didn't, it's too late for regrets now."

"Mark my words, karma will find you," Margaret spat. "You're about to become a mother yourself. I pray your child treats you with the same cruelty. May you never know happiness."

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists, but her voice stayed steady. "If that's your wish, so be it. I didn't choose my family. The only choice I have is who I become."

The words tasted like ash. Beatrice's final warning echoed in her mind, but Evelyn pushed it aside. Nothing would change her purpose here.

Nathaniel's hand closed around hers, his touch warm against her icy skin. His voice cut through the tension like a blade. "You can reject Evelyn's help, but think carefully. What matters more—your pride or William's life?"

Margaret paled. Her grip on the doorframe tightened, knuckles whitening.

Sophia arrived then, arms laden with supplies. She gently pulled Margaret aside. "Mom, please. You trust Dr. Harrison, don't you? Let him help Dad."

The lifeline gave Margaret pause. With a stiff nod, she stepped aside, allowing Nathaniel, Evelyn, and Dr. Harrison to enter.

Dr. Harrison examined William, reviewing the charts with a frown. "No more stress or shocks. Another episode could cause cerebral hemorrhage. Until further notice, only immediate family may visit. He mustn't learn about the Mitchell Group's troubles."

"When will he wake?" Margaret demanded.

"It's a temporary coma. Rest and medication will bring him around."

Sophia nodded eagerly. "Thank you, Doctor. We'll ensure he's cared for."

Dr. Harrison's gaze flicked to Nathaniel. "I'll be staying at the hospital. Page me if needed."

His presence was a favor—one few could secure.

As they exited, Sophia stopped them in the hall. "Nathaniel, thank you for arranging this. I'm grateful."

Nathaniel's response was cool. "No thanks necessary. He's Evelyn's father. That's reason enough."

Sophia's smile faltered. After an awkward beat, she turned to Evelyn. "Can we talk? Alone?"
###Chapter 302
Do Me a Favor

Evelyn had been quiet since stepping into the hospital room. After hearing Sophia's question, she turned to Nathaniel with calm detachment. "Go with Dr. Harrison. I'll meet you in the parking lot."

"Understood." Nathaniel gave a brief nod before following the physician out.

Now alone, Evelyn and Sophia exchanged tense glances before moving toward the corridor's end. The large window overlooked the city, its glass reflecting their strained expressions.

Evelyn broke the silence first. "What is it you want to say?"

Sophia pressed her lips together, her gaze frosty. "Do you blame us?"

"I don’t follow."

"Because Mom and Dad sent you away to live with Grandma, you resent us, don’t you?"

Evelyn studied her sister for a moment before replying, "Does it matter if I do? You heard Mom—she wants nothing to do with me. So why ask?"

"Evelyn, they had their reasons—"

"Is that all? If so, save your breath. You aren’t me, and I’m not them. Don’t waste time trying to justify their choices."

Evelyn cut her off sharply. The silence between them thickened.

Finally, Evelyn exhaled. "We can’t hide Dad’s condition from the Mitchell Group or the press. The company needs stability. You’re the legitimate heir—it’s time you stepped up."

Sophia bristled. "Don’t call me that. You said we don’t choose our parents. Did I?"

"Sophia, you’re missing the point."

"No. You’re bitter because they favored me. That’s why you won’t help Dad or the family now."

A dry laugh escaped Evelyn. "You think this is about jealousy? I’m warning you about what’s coming. Ignore it if you want."

With that, she turned on her heel and left.

The Mitchells had never given her warmth or belonging. Though she’d grown numb to their neglect, facing them still left a hollow ache.

Back at the apartment, Nathaniel was ending a call on the balcony when she entered. He took one look at her expression and frowned.

"What’s wrong?"

Evelyn met his eyes. "Nathaniel, I need a favor."

###Chapter 303

Nathaniel studied Evelyn with surprise. After everything that had happened between them, she had never once asked for his help. Yet here she was, standing before him.

"What do you need?" he asked.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, considering her words carefully.

In Marseille, Nathaniel held immense influence. Both allies and adversaries respected his power. Right now, he was her only option.

She exhaled softly. "Can you speak to the creditors pursuing the Mitchell Group? Ask them to extend the deadline—especially now that my father is hospitalized. The stress could worsen his condition. Dr. Harrison warned another shock might be catastrophic."

Nathaniel's gaze lingered on her for a long moment. "You still care about what happens to them?"

Evelyn shook her head.

"No. I just don’t believe in kicking someone when they’re down. The debts will be repaid—but forcing immediate payment will only make things worse."

In truth, she wondered if agreeing to William’s earlier request—asking Nathaniel to salvage the project—might have prevented this.

But temporary fixes wouldn’t solve the Mitchells’ deeper problems. If they didn’t face reality now, the consequences would be far worse later.

Nathaniel nodded.

"I’ll have Samuel handle it immediately. Don’t worry."

"Thank you," she said.

His lips curved slightly. He hated hearing those words from her.

Samuel swiftly contacted all the Mitchell Group’s creditors. He also arranged round-the-clock security at the hospital, barring anyone but family from entering.

But something didn’t add up.

Samuel returned to the office, frowning. "Mr. Martin, the interest rates on these debts are exorbitant. Every payment has only covered interest—none of the principal. It’s been years."

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed. "You reviewed the contracts?"

"Yes. They’re all signed by Mr. Mitchell. But it doesn’t make sense."

"Why not?" Nathaniel’s tone was flat.

Samuel hesitated. "Why would he agree to such unfair terms? He’s been paying interest for years—far exceeding the original debt. He had to know."

"You think he didn’t?"

Samuel paused. "No. He must have. So why accept it?"

Nathaniel leaned back. "Exactly. Why?"

The realization struck Samuel. "Unless he was deceived from the start."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "Have someone monitor the Mitchell Group discreetly. Employees might exploit the chaos."

"Understood." Samuel left quickly.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. If his suspicions were correct, this wasn’t just a financial crisis—it ran much deeper.

Otherwise, how had William failed to notice until now?

###Chapter 304

The Mitchell family's troubles were multiplying. While William remained hospitalized, new crises erupted at the company.

Originally specializing in merchandise design, The Mitchell Group had maintained partnerships with numerous firms over the years. Their warehouses overflowed with inventory from these collaborations. With William incapacitated, opportunistic employees began looting the stockrooms, selling goods on the black market.

Sophia only discovered the theft when Victor Mills alerted her. As acting head of household, she had no choice but to handle the situation herself.

During the drive to the warehouse, Victor questioned her. "Sophia, shouldn't we inform Mr. Mitchell about this? We're not equipped to handle it alone."

"My father's condition is too fragile," Sophia insisted. "The doctor said no stress. We must keep this from him."

Victor, William's longtime assistant, fell silent at her firm tone.

The warehouse resembled a war zone when they arrived. Crates lay overturned, packaging materials strewn everywhere. Elliot Montgomery, the warehouse supervisor, rushed to greet them with excuses. "Mr. Mills, Ms. Mitchell, I can't explain this mess. We've never had issues before."

Sophia's voice remained measured despite her rising anger. "You're responsible for security here. How could this happen under your watch?"

Elliot's expression darkened. "I implemented all standard protocols! The thieves outnumbered my staff. What was I supposed to do?"

His defensive tone confirmed Sophia's suspicions - he didn't respect her authority. When she remained silent, Elliot escalated. "If you're blaming me, I'll resign immediately. Just pay what you owe me!"

"Elliot," Sophia countered, "after all these years working for my father, is this how you repay his trust? Help us through this crisis, and you'll be rewarded."

Victor intervened, pulling Elliot aside for a private discussion. Though respected within the company, Victor's mediation did little to ease Sophia's frustration. These seasoned employees clearly viewed her as inexperienced and unqualified.

Then Evelyn's advice surfaced in her memory: "Real change starts with operational foundations."

While Victor pacified Elliot, Sophia dialed Evelyn.

After explaining the situation, she pleaded, "We need your expertise. Please help us save the family business."

The request startled Evelyn. Involvement would create complications. As Nathaniel's wife, her interference could spark rumors about Martin Group resources being diverted to prop up the failing Mitchell enterprise. Worse, it might validate Margaret's accusations about ulterior motives.

"I'm sorry," Evelyn replied firmly. "You're William's acknowledged daughter - you have more legitimacy to implement changes than I ever would."
###Chapter 305 

"But I'm completely clueless and helpless. With the warehouse robbed, the manager will just resign to avoid blame. Evelyn, won't you really help us?" Sophia's voice trembled with desperation, fighting back tears as she glanced toward the door where Victor and Elliot lingered. "Evelyn, please... help the Mitchell family."

Silence stretched on the other end of the line.

Seated at her desk, Evelyn exhaled slowly before responding. "A robbery happened under the manager's watch. Resigning won't absolve him—he's accountable. Right now, you need to secure loyalty, not grovel for it."

Sophia hesitated. "Should I confront him directly?"

"Or what? Beg him like a victim?" Evelyn's tone sharpened, then softened. "Remember, you're the employer. They stole from you. Even in crisis, no employee has the right to undermine you. If you let this slide, they'll push further next time."

"You're right. You always know what to do. Why won't you come help me?"

"Testing me now?" Evelyn's voice turned icy.

"No! This is real, and I'm lost," Sophia rushed to clarify.

"Then learn this: trust only yourself and the Mitchells. No one else." The words were a warning, final.

Sophia didn't understand why Evelyn refused to step in, but she clung to the advice like a lifeline. By the time Victor and Elliot reentered, her spine had straightened.

Victor spoke first. "Sophia, Elliot contacted the thieves. They'll return the goods or pay for what's sold. We'll pretend it never happened."

"Is that all?" Sophia's fingers tightened around her phone, Evelyn's words echoing. Don't beg. You're not at fault.

Victor blinked. "What else would you do?"

Her gaze flicked to Elliot, then back. "Mr. Mills, the Mitchell Group may be struggling, but we're not powerless. If we ignore theft, it'll happen again. We're calling the police."

Elliot paled. "Mr. Mills—?"

Victor's frown deepened. "Sophia, this will shatter morale. We need unity now."

"And we'll have it—by setting boundaries." She stood firm. "I'll take full responsibility."

Elliot stammered, "Then I—I quit! This is betrayal!"

Victor's jaw clenched as Sophia picked up the phone, her resolve unshaken.
###Chapter 306 

Sophia crossed her arms. "Elliot, you can walk away, but the theft happened under your watch. Resigning won't absolve you of responsibility."

Elliot's mouth went dry. His gaze flickered to Victor, who remained stone-faced.

This wasn't the spoiled heiress he knew. Sophia spoke with chilling precision, every word calculated.

"It wasn't me!" Elliot blurted. "I had no part in this!"

"I know," Sophia said coolly. "But you're the supervisor. Unless you want police involvement, you'll stay and fix this. Help us through this crisis, and I'll ensure my father recognizes your loyalty. So—are you resigning?"

Victor finally spoke. "This is your last chance, Elliot. Take it."

Defeated, Elliot agreed. The thieves were handed over to authorities.

Sophia left, more convinced than ever—Evelyn knew exactly how to handle this. Only she could orchestrate such flawless damage control.

Victor escorted her to the hospital entrance. "Tell me when your father wakes," he said quietly.

Sophia nodded without looking back.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had no idea she'd become Sophia's lifeline. Hanging up, she dialed Charlotte.

Charlotte's voice held surprise. "To what do I owe this honor?"

"I need a favor."

"Should I be worried?"

Evelyn smirked. "I need two people from Alexander."

"Zero chance," Charlotte deadpanned.

"Wrong answer. If I went directly to him, he'd agree instantly. I'm asking you first out of respect."

A beat of silence. "Who do you want?"

"His PR director—temporarily. And an assistant for Marseille."

Charlotte scoffed. "Since when does Nathaniel need Alexander's help?"

"Not Nathaniel. The Mitchell Group." Evelyn explained the situation. "I need outsiders—people with no ties to Marseille."

"So you want me to negotiate?"

"Yes. Tell Alexander I'll work for Prescott Group for two years. No pay."

Charlotte whistled. "That's some offer."

"Get it done. I need them tomorrow."

"Why not ask him yourself?"

Evelyn's lips thinned. "Because he'll exploit it. That's where you come in."

Charlotte laughed. "I love this side of you. Consider it done."

She found Alexander in his study. To her shock, he agreed the moment Evelyn's terms were mentioned.

"What could she possibly do for you that's worth this?" Charlotte demanded.

Alexander merely smiled.

###Chapter 307

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand hall of the Martin estate, the weight of Nathaniel's absence pressed down on her.

She had expected him to be there.

Instead, she was greeted by the cold, calculating gaze of Edward Martin.

"Where is he?" she demanded, her voice steady despite the storm brewing inside her.

Edward's lips curled into a smirk. "Business, my dear. You know how it is."

She didn’t believe him.

Not for a second.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Samuel Yates.

"Mr. Martin is at the penthouse. He asked not to be disturbed."

Evelyn clenched her fists.

Since when did Nathaniel shut her out?

She turned on her heel and marched toward the exit, ignoring Edward's mocking chuckle.

The drive to the penthouse was a blur.

Her mind raced with possibilities—none of them good.

When she arrived, the elevator ride felt endless.

The doors slid open to reveal an empty living room.

Then she heard it—the faint sound of a woman’s laughter.

Her blood ran cold.

She followed the sound to the master bedroom.

The door was slightly ajar.

Evelyn pushed it open.

And froze.

Nathaniel stood by the window, his back to her.

And beside him—Isabella Davis.

His ex.

His first love.

The woman who had nearly destroyed them before.

Isabella turned, her smile widening when she saw Evelyn.

"Well, well," she purred. "Look who decided to join us."

Nathaniel finally turned.

His expression was unreadable.

Evelyn’s heart shattered.

"Care to explain?" she whispered.

Nathaniel didn’t answer.

Isabella did.

"Oh, darling," she said, stepping closer to Nathaniel. "Didn’t he tell you?"

Evelyn’s vision blurred.

She didn’t wait for an answer.

She turned and ran.

Nathaniel called after her, but she didn’t stop.

Couldn’t stop.

The elevator doors closed just as he reached them.

Alone, Evelyn finally let the tears fall.

What had just happened?

And why did it feel like her world was ending?

###Chapter 307 Suspicion

"Evelyn didn't tell you?" Alexander asked, his gaze sharp as it landed on Charlotte.

Before she could respond, he pressed on. "If you want the truth, answer me. Did you meet him when you were in Marseille?"

Charlotte's expression turned icy. "You've asked this before. If you're so curious, investigate it yourself." She spun on her heel and walked away.

Alexander watched her retreating figure, his jaw tight. He wouldn't waste time questioning her if he could find the answers on his own. But the fact that he couldn’t—that was what frustrated him.

Something was slipping beyond his control, and it unsettled him.

After a tense silence, he called his secretary. "Send the PR director to my office."

Within hours, his people were en route to Marseille. Evelyn had requested them, and though he didn’t ask why, he wasn’t about to refuse. It wasn’t a loss for him.

By morning, they arrived. Evelyn directed them to the Mitchell Group, where Sophia had already arranged for their temporary roles until William returned.

With that handled, Evelyn and Gabrielle headed to the hospital to visit the injured employees.

The ward was crowded, three beds to a room. Evelyn approached a middle-aged woman sitting alone.

"Hello," she said warmly. "We’re colleagues of your son. We heard you weren’t feeling well and wanted to check on you."

The woman—Zachary’s mother—looked surprised. "You work with Zachary?"

Gabrielle nodded quickly. "Yes, we’re close to him."

His mother hesitated. "Are you cooks too?"

Evelyn almost smiled but didn’t answer. Instead, she glanced around. "Why are there so many people here?"

Zachary’s mother lowered her voice. "They jumped from a building. They say they’re fine, but they keep complaining to the doctors, demanding reports."

"Injury reports?" Evelyn clarified.

"Yes. Their families are talking about suing the company for compensation."

Evelyn exchanged a glance with Gabrielle but said nothing. If they were truly fine, why refuse discharge?

It smelled like a setup.

After a polite farewell, they left the ward.

Once in the car, Gabrielle turned to Evelyn. "Ms. Mitchell, do you think they’re trying to extort you?"

"You noticed it too?" Evelyn asked.

Gabrielle nodded. "Zachary’s mother said they seemed fine."

Exactly. Healthy people didn’t cling to hospital beds unless they had an agenda.

Evelyn drove back to the company, her mind racing. She needed to see Nathaniel. There were questions only he could answer.

After dropping Gabrielle off, Evelyn stayed in the car. "Don’t mention the hospital visit to anyone. Gossip spreads, and I don’t want word getting out prematurely."

Gabrielle agreed, and Evelyn pulled away, her grip tight on the wheel.

She had a feeling this was far from over.

###Chapter 308

Evelyn had always been the careful type, meticulously planning for every possible risk and contingency.

Gabrielle nodded in agreement before turning to enter the building. Evelyn drove straight to Martin Group headquarters.

She didn’t call Nathaniel. Instead, she took the elevator up unannounced.

The receptionist recognized Evelyn immediately, greeting her warmly.

When Evelyn reached Nathaniel’s office floor, she nearly collided with Samuel stepping out. "Mr. Yates, is Nathaniel in?"

Samuel nodded politely. "Yes, Mrs. Martin." He held the door open and announced, "Sir, your wife is here."

Nathaniel’s gaze snapped up, locking onto Evelyn.

The door clicked shut behind Samuel, leaving them alone.

Evelyn hesitated under his intense stare. "Am I interrupting?"

A flicker of something unreadable crossed Nathaniel’s face. His voice dropped. "Did you need something?"

She moved to the sofa, sitting gracefully. Nathaniel followed, his steps deliberate.

"I was at the hospital earlier," she admitted.

"Visiting your father?"

"No." She shook her head. "The employees who jumped—I went to see them."

His frown deepened. "Alone? Why didn’t you tell me? Those people are desperate for compensation targets. It wasn’t safe." The rapid-fire questions left her momentarily speechless.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "I kept my identity hidden. Just a friend visiting another friend. They never knew I was there."

Some tension left Nathaniel’s shoulders.

"Learn anything useful?"

"Yes." She relayed the hospital conversations verbatim.

Nathaniel studied her. "So you don’t buy the layoff suicide narrative?"

"Of course not. If it were just termination grief, their families wouldn’t be organizing like this," Evelyn countered.

A faint smirk touched his lips. "You’ve gotten good at reading people."

"Isn’t that basic logic, Mr. Martin?" She arched a brow.

The exchange revealed something new—layers of Evelyn he’d never noticed before.

"I could assign Samuel to assist you temporarily," he offered.

"Would you really?" Her eyes lit up.

Nathaniel chuckled. "Had that thought already, didn’t you?"

"Absolutely not," she lied.

"Sure about that?"

"Fine, maybe I considered it. But I didn’t expect you to volunteer him. No take-backs." The words came out unexpectedly playful, almost commanding.

Nathaniel’s gaze darkened as he watched her. The negotiation ended with Evelyn trading a dinner date for Samuel’s temporary services.

When leaving time came, Nathaniel dismissed Samuel, choosing to drive them home personally.

During the ride, he asked quietly, "Why such personal interest in Mitchell Corp’s mess?"

Evelyn stiffened slightly. "Just... helping where I can."

She turned toward the window. Nathaniel kept his eyes on the road but pressed, "Or is my wife softer-hearted than she admits?"

###Chapter 309 

Evelyn turned her head to look at Nathaniel, but remained silent. Whether it was out of reluctance or hesitation, she didn’t answer.

Nathaniel didn’t press further. His phone rang abruptly, cutting through the tension.

It was Samuel.

"Mr. Martin," Samuel said, his voice crisp. "I’ve just confirmed that the Mitchell Group has hired two new executive managers. Sophia Mitchell personally brought them in. After some digging, I discovered they’re from Dresden."

"I see." Nathaniel ended the call and set his phone aside. His gaze darkened as he studied Evelyn. "Did you arrange for those two to join the Mitchell Group?"

Evelyn tilted her head slightly, a faint smile playing on her lips. "You found out already?"

She didn’t deny it.

"I sent them to keep an eye on things. If anything goes wrong, they’ll handle it immediately."

She paused, then added, "I asked Alexander for them."

Nathaniel’s expression shifted. "He’s not an easy man to persuade. Why would he lend you his people?"

There was skepticism in his tone. Businessmen understood each other—favors like this weren’t given without reason.

Evelyn’s smile deepened. "Charlotte and I are close. Even though they’re not blood-related, they’ve always been like family. It’s not surprising he’d help me."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. His fingers flexed slightly before he spoke again, his voice low. "Evelyn, I don’t care why he helped you. But remember—you’re married. And pregnant. Keep your distance from other men."

Evelyn’s lips pressed into a thin line. She said nothing.

Later that evening, after dinner with Beatrice, they took a quiet walk together.

When Evelyn stepped out of the shower, Nathaniel was reviewing his schedule for the next day. She sat beside him, her damp hair curling at the ends.

"Nathaniel," she began, her voice steady. "Any updates on the investigation?"

He glanced at her. "Which one?"

"The person behind Rosalind."

Since the incident, they’d kept it from the Martins and Beatrice. Evelyn had been too shaken to consider hiring another servant.

But Nathaniel had other plans. He intended to bring in someone from Martin Manor—someone trustworthy. With Evelyn pregnant, he wouldn’t risk an unknown face in their home.

His gaze lingered on her before he answered. "No leads yet. But if there’s anything, you’ll be the first to know."

Evelyn nodded, satisfied for now.

She picked up her phone to call Charlotte, oblivious to the way Nathaniel watched her—his expression unreadable, a storm brewing beneath the surface.

The next afternoon, after countless inquiries and discreet gifts, Samuel finally had something concrete.

He arrived at Evelyn’s office. She gestured for Gabrielle to bring coffee, then shut the door behind them.

Gregory spotted Samuel and turned to Gabrielle. "Isn’t that Mr. Martin’s secretary?"

Gabrielle nodded. "Mr. Yates."

"What’s he doing here?"

"No idea. Ms. Mitchell didn’t say, but they must have something important to discuss."

Gregory’s eyes flicked toward the closed office door, curiosity flickering.

Inside, Evelyn motioned for Samuel to sit.

He did, taking a sip of water before sliding a photo across the desk.

"Mrs. Martin," he said. "This is Victor Mills. He’s been William Mitchell’s secretary for years. The entire Mitchell family trusts him implicitly."

Evelyn studied the photo, her expression unreadable. "Did Victor have any contact with the two who jumped?"

###Chapter 310 

"Absolutely. I was skeptical at first. Victor being Mr. Mitchell's right-hand man, I assumed he'd be treated well after all these years of loyal service. But the evidence doesn't lie." Samuel's words left Evelyn speechless.

If Victor was compromised, the Mitchell Group's crisis wasn't just about operational failures—it was orchestrated.

Samuel studied Evelyn's tense silence before murmuring, "Mrs. Martin, what's your next move?"

Evelyn locked eyes with him. "Does Sophia suspect anything about Victor?"

"Not at all. She'd never hide it if she did." Samuel knew Sophia wore her heart on her sleeve.

Evelyn's gaze sharpened. A full thirty seconds passed before she spoke. "Can you arrange a meeting with Victor? We need to test him. Once he's rattled, he'll slip up. Otherwise, he'll stay buried, and we're powerless."

Samuel froze.

For a split second, he saw Nathaniel in the steel of Evelyn's expression.

She tilted her head. "Mr. Yates? Your thoughts?"

He snapped back. "Brilliant plan, Mrs. Martin. Should we leave now?"

With a curt nod, Evelyn followed him out.

Gregory emerged from the break room, coffee in hand. Spotting Evelyn, he raised a brow. "Heading out?"

"To the hospital."

"Visiting your father? How is he? Mind if I drop by soon?" His eyes flicked to Samuel, cool and dismissive, before settling on Evelyn.

"He's stable, but no visitors yet. Too much stress could trigger another episode. We'll talk once things calm down."

"Understood. Need anything, just shout. I've got your back."

"Wouldn't dream of letting you off the hook." Her smirk drew a chuckle from Gregory, easing the tension.

Downstairs, Samuel drove while Evelyn texted Sophia:
[Meet me at Mitchell Group now. Urgent.]
Sophia replied instantly:
[Right now? What’s wrong?]
[Details later.]

Evelyn pocketed her phone as Samuel's grip tightened on the wheel.

"Mrs. Martin, seatbelt. Now."

Her pulse spiked. "Why?"

"We've got a tail."

Evelyn twisted in her seat. A black sedan trailed them, steady and deliberate.

"You're certain?"

The car accelerated, closing the gap.

Samuel's jaw clenched. "Oh, I'm sure."

###Chapter 311 

"Yes. It's been tailing us since we left." Samuel's grip tightened on the steering wheel. "I deliberately changed routes, but it's persistent. I'm going to accelerate. Please buckle up."

Evelyn secured her seatbelt and glanced at Samuel. "Don't stress. If we can't lose it, it's fine."

"Understood." Samuel met her gaze briefly before pressing the gas pedal. The car surged forward.

Evelyn wasn't overly concerned about being followed. She turned to peer at the vehicle behind them. It matched their speed, confirming her suspicions.

Too coincidental.

Her fingers curled slightly against the seat. An uneasy sensation settled in her chest.

Samuel maneuvered through three intersections before finally shaking off their pursuer.

Once the car steadied, Evelyn broke the silence. "Mr. Yates, were you followed when you came to meet me?"

"Not that I noticed. If they were, they kept their distance."

"Then that car was specifically tracking me." Her voice turned icy.

She didn't elaborate, but the weight of recent events pressed heavily on her.

When they arrived at Mitchell Group, Evelyn didn’t exit immediately. Instead, she sat in contemplative silence before asking, "Who do you think was following us?"

"Mrs. Martin, I can't say for certain. I'll report this to Mr. Martin immediately and have it investigated."

"Good. Speaking of which, Nathaniel mentioned Rosalind’s case still has no leads. Who’s handling it? Why the delay?"

Samuel stiffened. His gaze flickered away.

Evelyn caught the shift. "What’s wrong?"

"Nothing." He kept his eyes lowered. "The investigation is... complicated. Mr. Martin assigned it to me, but I’ve been occupied lately. It’s been temporarily postponed."

"That’s fine. Just keep me updated." She brushed it off, though his reaction nagged at her.

Before she could dwell, Sophia arrived.

The sisters entered Mitchell Group together. Sophia leaned in. "Why the sudden visit? Is something wrong?"

"Where’s Mr. Mills?" Evelyn asked.

"I assigned him to work with the team you sent."

Evelyn said nothing, heading straight for William’s office.

From down the hall, Victor’s raised voice reached them.

"You two are here to assist, not dictate. I’m taking charge now. Your opinions are irrelevant. I know what Mitchell Group needs—no lectures required."

Evelyn exchanged a glance with Sophia. Her expression darkened.

They reached the office door.

Samuel knocked. "Excuse me, Mr. Mitchell is currently hospitalized. He requested the Mitchell heirs check on operations."

Victor turned immediately. "Sophia, you're here." He barely spared Evelyn a glance—she held no standing in the Mitchell family.

Sophia smiled politely. "Mr. Mills, Evelyn and I are here to assess the situation."

Only then did Victor acknowledge Evelyn.

As Nathaniel’s wife, she wasn’t someone he could outright disrespect—but he wouldn’t grovel either. He kept his tone neutral.

"Why are you here now?"

###Chapter 312 Tension

"Victor, you've been with the Martin Group for many years, haven't you?" Evelyn's tone was icy, deliberately avoiding the respectful "Mr. Mills" that Sophia used.

Victor's expression tightened. "Your father and I have been partners for decades. Since you don't live with the Martins, you might not understand. Sophia knows exactly how close I am to this family."

"Victor, I'm simply asking how long you've worked here. Your personal relationship with my father is irrelevant." Evelyn's sharp retort darkened Victor's face.

Sophia tugged at Evelyn's sleeve, silently urging her to stop. But one cold glance from Evelyn made her freeze mid-motion.

Evelyn continued, "Victor, in all your years here, this is the first time a layoff has led to a suicide attempt, correct?"

"Obviously," Victor snapped.

"Since it's unprecedented, we handle it differently." Evelyn strode to the sofa and sat. She turned to Alexander's secretary. "Do we have files on the two employees who jumped?"

"Right here, Ms. Martin."

Evelyn skimmed the documents, then locked eyes with Victor. "Their contracts were expiring this month. If laid off, they'd receive severance. Doesn't their timing seem...convenient?"

"Ms. Martin, you've never worked here. You don't understand operations. Those men were desperate to keep their jobs. Their actions, while extreme, were understandable. But the company comes first." Victor's glare burned with resentment.

Evelyn smirked. "Victor, I can't tell—are you defending the Martin Group or those reckless employees?"

"The Martin Group, of course," Victor growled.

"Good. For a moment, I thought you sympathized with the jumpers." Evelyn's stare didn’t waver.

Victor bristled. "What’s that supposed to mean? Sophia, listen to her! After everything I’ve done for this family, even William never spoke to me like this!"

"Mr. Mills, please—Evelyn’s just concerned about the company," Sophia interjected weakly, shooting Evelyn a pleading look.

Evelyn ignored her. "Victor, go to the hospital. Offer them new positions and full compensation if they agree to settle quietly. If not, we’ll sue. Their contracts are nearly void anyway. The law will side with us."

"And who are you to give such orders?" Victor sneered.

Evelyn’s smile didn’t reach her eyes. "I may not have grown up here, but I’m a Martin. That makes me an heir. Any problem with me delegating this? Though, if you refuse, I’ll find someone else. Secretaries are replaceable."

"You—!" Victor choked on his fury. Finally, he spat, "I demand to see William. He’s the only one who can—"

"Then consider yourself on leave, Victor. You’ve served my father long enough. Take a break." Evelyn’s voice was lethally calm.

###Chapter 313 

Evelyn smiled, but her mind was already made up during the conversation.

She was William's daughter. Though she held no shares in Mitchell Group, her name alone carried weight. Sophia hadn't objected either, silently endorsing her decision.

Victor's position was cleared out. Evelyn handed his responsibilities to the two men she'd requested from Alexander. Victor wanted to protest, but the employment contract left him no choice but to comply.

Everything fell into place once Alexander's people stepped into Mitchell Group.

With that handled, Evelyn left the building. Sophia trailed behind her, confusion knitting her brows. "Evelyn, Victor has been loyal to Dad for years. Removing him like this... it'll upset the senior executives."

"If I didn't, Mitchell Group would've collapsed," Evelyn replied.

Sophia frowned. "What do you mean?"

"Trust no one but yourself. Keep Dad undisturbed until he recovers. Understood?"

After the warehouse incident, Sophia had started relying on Evelyn's judgment. She nodded.

Sophia seemed sharp, but business strategy eluded her.

Evelyn studied her but kept her thoughts to herself. No need to provoke her further.

Once their talk ended, Evelyn headed to the car. Sophia called out, "Aren’t you going to visit Dad at the hospital?"

"No. I doubt they want to see me."

"That’s not—"

"Stop. You don’t even believe what you’re saying." Evelyn cut her off and rolled up the window.

She leaned back, eyes closed. Samuel slid into the driver’s seat.

"Mrs. Martin, the office or home?"

"Home. I'm exhausted."

"Understood." He started the engine.

Back at the apartment, Evelyn showered and collapsed into bed.

Meanwhile, Samuel made his move.

After Evelyn left Mitchell Group, Victor had rushed to the hospital where the injured employees were recovering. Samuel had already stationed someone to tail him.

Next, he dug into Victor’s accounts and his closest contacts.

The findings were damning.

Victor had been scheming for a year. Exploiting William’s trust, he’d sold off Mitchell Group’s assets for personal gain. On the surface, the company appeared stable, but beneath, it was crumbling. The fallout with Martin Group had only exposed the rot.

Worse, Mitchell Group’s massive debt? All Victor’s doing. He’d manipulated William into signing predatory contracts. Every creditor had ties to him—he’d personally handled every deal.

And the Martin Group’s payment? Diverted straight into Victor’s pocket.

The "suicide" incident? A staged distraction to cover his tracks. Victor had planned to siphon the funds while William was overwhelmed, but Evelyn’s interference derailed him.

Samuel presented Evelyn with irrefutable proof—documents, recordings, everything.

"With this, Victor’s guilt is undeniable," he said.

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed. "Thank you, Samuel."

###Chapter 314

"You're welcome. It's my duty." Evelyn accepted the documents but hesitated before acting. She turned to Samuel with uncertainty. "Do you think the Mitchells will believe any of this?"

She had little faith in her own family.

Given how they'd treated her, she was certain they'd side with Victor over her.

Evelyn's mind swirled with doubt.

Samuel paused, unable to give a definitive answer. The Mitchells were unpredictable.

After a moment, he offered a solution. "Mrs. Martin, Sophia Mitchell seems reasonable. Why not send the evidence anonymously? That way, she can decide for herself. If she chooses to trust Victor, you won’t be implicated. What do you think?"

Evelyn stayed silent.

It felt ridiculous—wanting justice but lacking the courage to confront them directly. She still cared, despite everything.

With a quiet exhale, she followed Samuel’s advice and emailed the files to Sophia.

Hours passed with no response.

If this continued, she’d let it go.

Her focus shifted to the design competition. Registration was complete—now she needed three assistants and a winning concept.

The theme? A farm-inspired resort.

The Martin Group had acquired land years ago, untouched until now. Their vision? A luxury farm retreat.

The first round judged the overall framework. The finals would hinge on execution. Only the top three would see their designs realized.

That evening, Evelyn sat slumped before her laptop, drained and uninspired.

Nathaniel brought her fruit. "Trouble?"

"Why a farm?" she muttered.

He smirked. "The land’s unsuitable for skyscrapers."

"It could be a park."

"Evelyn," he said dryly, "I’m a businessman. Parks don’t profit. Farms do."

She scoffed. "Capitalists. Always so straightforward."

"Mocking me?" He gripped her chin, forcing her gaze to his. His voice dropped. "What’s really bothering you?"

Her frustration was palpable.

"Nothing."

"Really?"

"Yes."

"Then why attack my company?" His piercing stare demanded honesty.

She exhaled. "Because I have to design for this competition. Your theme’s a nightmare. Can’t I complain?"

"Too difficult?"

"Obviously."

A lie. She just lacked inspiration.

Nathaniel’s smile turned sly. "If drafting’s such a struggle, why not bribe me for a free pass to the finals?"

His teasing tone made her roll her eyes.

But the tension between them crackled—unspoken, electric.

###Chapter 316

"Dad, the truth is..."

"William, you've seen the stark contrast between Sophia and Evelyn. Once you're fully recovered and discharged, I think it's time to officially bring Sophia into the company. The Mitchell Group will eventually be hers. As for Evelyn, I'm cutting her off. Her cold-heartedness makes her unworthy of anything from this family."

Margaret's resentment toward Evelyn was palpable. She couldn't shake the memory of Evelyn's indifference—how she had refused to help when they needed her most. In Margaret's eyes, everything that had gone wrong was Evelyn's fault.

William's expression darkened. "Enough. Be quiet."

He had been in a foul mood since waking up.

Margaret fell silent.

But Sophia couldn't hold back. "Mom, Dad, you're misunderstanding Evelyn. She has been helping since the crisis at Mitchell Group. She even brought in two crisis management specialists from Dresden to stabilize things. It was Evelyn who exposed Victor's embezzlement. Dad, if it weren't for her, you wouldn't have had such a smooth recovery."

Her words hung heavily in the air. Neither William nor Margaret responded.

Sophia lowered her voice. "Mom, please... stop blaming her."

Margaret stiffened. "She only stepped in to avoid being labeled heartless. Besides, she caused all this mess in the first place."

Sophia opened her mouth to argue, but a nurse entered with William's medication, cutting the conversation short.

With Victor's arrest, many of the Mitchell family's problems had been resolved. The injured employees received their rightful compensation, though their contracts weren't renewed. Their attempt to extort money had failed.

But the Mitchell Group's core issues remained. The debts were still massive, even after accounting for Victor's theft and the unfair contracts.

Following advice from Alexander's secretary, Sophia sold off multiple Mitchell Group properties to settle debts. The company's reputation in the business world continued to decline.

Still, it was better than bankruptcy. At least they still had a company.

As a result, Margaret dismissed most of the staff at Mitchell Manor. The once-lively estate now felt hollow.

William was discharged days later and returned home to recover. Since the accident, he had become withdrawn, often spending hours lost in thought.

Sophia confided in Evelyn. "Dad hasn't been himself lately. I don't know if it's because of the company, but he barely speaks to anyone. He just... shuts himself away. What do you think is wrong?"

"Did he react at all when Victor was arrested?"

"No."

"Not even surprise? Anger?"

"Nothing."

Sophia frowned. "Evelyn, why are you asking this? Is something wrong?"

Evelyn hesitated. "Would it be alright if I came by tonight?"

William was home now. It was only right that she visit.

If they’ll even let me in.

###Chapter 317

Sophia spoke in a rush. "This will always be your home. You're welcome anytime."

Ever since the Mitchell Group faced turmoil, Sophia had witnessed Evelyn's capabilities and her crucial help to the family. A deep, unexpected fondness had taken root in her heart.

When Evelyn mentioned returning, Sophia wasted no time informing Margaret.

Margaret's expression turned icy.

"Is she coming back to mock us?"

"Mom, that's not true. Evelyn cares about Dad. She saved us this time. Without her, things could've been disastrous. If Victor hadn't been exposed, Dad would still trust him blindly. The Mitchells might have lost everything."

Though Sophia didn't fully understand why Evelyn had hesitated at first, she sensed there had to be a reason. Evelyn wasn't cruel—she had refused, yet still stepped in when it mattered.

After persistent persuasion, Margaret finally gave a reluctant nod.

Evelyn arrived at Mitchell Manor alone. The moment the car pulled up, Sophia rushed outside to greet her.

This was the first time Evelyn felt something different about returning home. The shift was unsettling.

Sophia beamed at her. "Evelyn, perfect timing. Mom's almost done with dinner. Let's eat and catch up."

She reached for Evelyn's hand. The sudden familiarity made Evelyn stiffen.

Evelyn didn't move. "Please don’t. Just act like you always have. Otherwise, I might think you want something."

Sophia flushed. "I—I didn’t mean—"

"Stop. I came to check on Dad and ask about Victor. As for apologies, save them. You haven’t done anything that warrants one."

Evelyn was never one for pretense. She spoke plainly, her tone cool but not unkind.

She knew she and Sophia would never share the same bond she had with Charlotte. And she refused to fake warmth.

Sophia's smile faltered, but she recovered quickly. "Let’s go inside."

She dropped Evelyn’s arm, though her gaze lingered on Evelyn’s abdomen. The slight curve was unmistakable now.

"How far along are you?"

"Four months."

"Six more to go. Can I visit when the baby comes?"

Evelyn blinked, taken aback. She studied Sophia’s hopeful expression before nodding. "Sure. But it’s still early."

Sophia grinned. They stepped inside.

The manor felt hollow without staff.

"Mom fired all the servants," Sophia explained. "Said we needed to cut costs and share the load."

"Hiring a cook and cleaner wouldn’t break the bank. Doing everything yourselves is exhausting."

"I agree. I’ll talk to her later."

They entered the living room just as Margaret emerged from the kitchen.

"Mom, Evelyn’s here."

Margaret gave a stiff nod but said nothing.

Evelyn met her eyes briefly. The memory of Margaret’s harsh words at the hospital still stung. She didn’t offer a greeting.

The tension thickened. Sophia intervened. "Mom, can you get Dad for dinner?"

Margaret left without a word.

The four of them sat at the table in silence.

None could remember the last time they’d shared a meal like this.

###Chapter 318 

Evelyn spoke up at that moment. "Dad, I need to ask you something."

William looked up from his plate. "What is it?"

"What do you think about Victor's arrest?"

The mention of Victor made William set down his fork.

"What exactly are you asking? Whether I feel betrayed by a secretary I trusted for years?"

Evelyn pushed her barely touched soup away. She hadn’t come here for dinner anyway.

Her gaze locked onto his. "Is that all you feel? Just betrayal?"

"What are you implying?"

"Victor said something when he was arrested. Didn’t Sophia tell you?"

Sophia quickly interjected, "Evelyn, he said a lot of things. Which part are you referring to?"

"He said the Mitchell family would face retribution. Did you hear that?"

"Yes. What about it?"

"Do you really think he was just cursing because he got caught?"

Evelyn’s eyes flicked to Sophia, who fell silent.

She pulled out her phone and played the video for William and Margaret.

"Dad, are you sure Victor didn’t mean something more by that?"

"Enough!"

William slammed his hands on the table, standing abruptly. His glare was icy.

"Stop asking questions that don’t concern you. He’s been arrested. What’s the point of this? Don’t think sending a few people to help the Mitchell Group makes up for the mess you caused."

Evelyn’s lips curved into a bitter smile. "You still blame me?"

"Don’t I have reason to?"

"If this hadn’t happened, would Victor have been exposed? Do you even know how much he embezzled? Don’t you feel responsible for the company’s crisis?"

"Why should I? I didn’t tell him to steal."

The words struck Evelyn silent.

She regretted coming.

She shouldn’t have bothered.

William coughed violently, his face reddening. Margaret rushed to his side, soothing him before handing him a glass of water. The air in the room turned heavy.

Margaret’s voice was sharp. "If you’re not here sincerely, then don’t stay. We don’t welcome half-hearted gestures."

Evelyn let out a cold laugh.

"Fine. I shouldn’t have come. Good intentions are never appreciated here."

She pushed back her chair and walked out without another word.

Sophia hurried after her, catching up just as Evelyn reached her car.

"Evelyn, don’t take it the wrong way. Mom was just worried about Dad. I know you meant well—"

"I’m done with this. Whatever’s between Victor and the Mitchells, I won’t interfere. And my people will be out of the Mitchell Group by tomorrow. Handle the rest yourselves."

She rolled up the window before Sophia could respond.

The regret burned. She had expected resistance, but not to be outright dismissed.

Was it ridiculous?

Back at the apartment, Nathaniel was waiting. His eyes narrowed when he saw her expression.

"I thought you were having dinner at the Mitchells’. Did it end already?"

###Chapter 319 

Evelyn remained silent. Her gaze flickered to Nathaniel before she spoke. "I thought you were having dinner with Thomas and the others. Why are you back so soon?"

"I'm heading out now. Want to join me?"

"No."

The tension between Evelyn and Thomas over Charlotte still lingered. After such a long time apart, the idea of facing him made her uncomfortable.

Nathaniel smirked, seeing right through her. "Afraid of an awkward reunion?"

"Not at all. I just don't want to be reminded of what happened to Charlotte."

He didn’t push further, recognizing the excuse for what it was.

His eyes locked onto hers, intense and probing. "What happened at the Mitchell estate? Aren’t you going to tell me?"

Evelyn met his stare and finally confessed her unease—the suspicions gnawing at her.

"You think Victor is involved?" Nathaniel frowned. "And your father dismissed it entirely?"

She narrowed her eyes, avoiding a direct answer. "Would it be cruel of me to walk away from the Mitchell family’s problems now?"

Nathaniel studied her face—not conventionally beautiful, but striking in its own way. His voice softened, warm and steady. "You’ve done more than enough. Even if you let go completely, no one could blame you."

Evelyn smiled faintly, letting the topic drop. "It’s late. You should go meet Thomas."

He hesitated, searching her expression one last time before leaving.

The moment the door clicked shut, Evelyn sank into the couch, staring blankly at the ceiling. A thought struck her—Isabella hadn’t reached out to Nathaniel in weeks.

Had they really cut ties?

Curious, she grabbed her phone and pulled up Isabella’s Twitter. The updates were sparse: training in isolation for an upcoming concert.

More surprising was the news that Isabella’s studio had dissolved. She was now signed under an entertainment company owned by the Martin Group.

Meaning Nathaniel controlled her career.

Evelyn scoffed at herself. With everything that had happened lately, she’d almost convinced herself that something between them had shifted. But this was proof—nothing had changed.

She was just another piece in his game.

"Evelyn," she muttered, pressing her fingers to her temples. "What are you even thinking? This is reality. Fantasies don’t come true."

Then why had he been so attentive lately?

Was it really just for the baby?

No answers came. Only frustration.

From then on, she avoided him deliberately. She couldn’t risk falling for his kindness again, losing herself in his orbit. To minimize contact, she made excuses—declining rides to work, leaving before he could offer.

After a few days, Nathaniel noticed the distance. He couldn’t pinpoint what he’d done wrong.

That evening, he showed up unannounced at her office.

Inside, Evelyn and Gregory were reviewing design submissions from candidates vying for her assistant position.

###Chapter 320

Evelyn and Gregory carefully examined more than a dozen blueprints, relying solely on their professional instincts. Without glancing at the names, they selected the top three designs and immediately forwarded them to Seraphina in front of all the participating employees.

In the end, Gabrielle, Liam Carter, and Maxwell Dawson were chosen.

Apart from Gabrielle, the other two were men—both exceptionally talented and innovative in their field.

The selection was fair, and no one raised objections.

Naturally, they became Evelyn’s assistants for the upcoming architectural competition.

Evelyn said, "You’ve all worked hard. Take two days to rest, and then we’ll begin preparations." Gabrielle, Liam, and Maxwell exchanged glances and nodded in agreement.

She continued, her tone firm, "From this moment on, every detail of our entry must remain confidential. Any discarded drafts or documents must be destroyed immediately. If there’s even a hint of plagiarism, we risk disqualification. Do you understand the gravity of this?"

The three of them straightened, their expressions serious. This wasn’t just a competition—it was a matter of integrity.

Once they confirmed their understanding, Evelyn dismissed them.

Gregory leaned in, lowering his voice. "Evelyn, don’t you think you’re being overly cautious? We’ve known these colleagues for years. Nothing will go wrong."

"Design isn’t something we can gamble with," Evelyn replied.

Gregory sighed. "Fine. Do what you think is best."

Evelyn had already made up her mind. She would draft a confidentiality agreement for Gabrielle, Liam, and Maxwell to sign before the competition officially began. It wasn’t about distrust—just precaution.

She walked to her desk and sat down. Gregory noticed the tension in her posture.

"Evelyn," he began carefully, "I haven’t seen Nathaniel dropping you off at work these past few days. Did something happen between you two?"

Evelyn paused, then met his gaze. "No."

Gregory narrowed his eyes slightly. He could sense the distance between them, though he wasn’t sure when it had started.

"Evelyn," he pressed, "are you unhappy with me?"

She frowned. "Gregory, why would you think that?"

"You’ve been distant lately. Outside of work, it’s like we barely interact. It feels deliberate—like you’re pushing me away." His gaze was intense, almost suffocating.

Evelyn looked away, forcing a smile. "Gregory, you’re imagining things. I’m not avoiding you. I just think it’s better to keep my distance from any man right now. I’m married—and pregnant."

"Evelyn," Gregory said, his voice rising, "do you really plan to stay with someone who doesn’t love you? Just because of the baby? Is he forcing you not to divorce? If he is, you can file for it. You can still find happiness after a divorce—"

Before Evelyn could respond, a deep voice cut in.

"And what exactly is her happiness? Being with you?"

###Chapter 321
Get Out

Evelyn and Gregory both froze. Their eyes snapped to the doorway where Nathaniel stood rigid, his expression dark and dangerous.

His voice was ice. "Mr. Wilson, you certainly take great interest in Evelyn's affairs. While friendship is one thing, boundaries exist. She is my wife now." He enunciated each word deliberately. "Are you suggesting you'd cross moral lines to meddle in our marriage?"

The unspoken threat hung heavy—Gregory was nothing. Not family. Not a lover. Just an outsider with no right to interfere.

Gregory didn’t back down. "Mr. Martin, as her friend, I only want what’s best for her. Unlike you, I wouldn’t see her trapped in a loveless marriage." His gaze flicked to Evelyn’s stomach. "Or is the child the only reason you’re keeping her?"

Evelyn’s breath hitched. She shot Nathaniel a wary glance before hissing, "Gregory, stop. Leave. Now."

But Gregory pressed on. "Let him answer, Evelyn. Don’t you deserve to know where you stand?"

Nathaniel’s laugh was razor-sharp. "Since when do I justify myself to you? What’s your real agenda here?" His eyes narrowed. "Or is this some pathetic attempt to play the hero?"

The air thickened with tension.

Gregory smirked. "Accusing me won’t change the truth. She’s miserable, and you know it."

Evelyn slammed her hands on the desk. "Enough! Both of you—get out!"

Their words were knives, each twist deepening her humiliation. Gregory’s "help" only made her feel smaller. And Nathaniel—

His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "You’ve wanted her for years. But she chose me. That won’t change."

Gregory fired back, "I want her happy. Can you say the same?"

Nathaniel stepped closer, his glare venomous. "Happiness? You think ruining her marriage is kindness? A man without principles deserves no respect—in any circle."

Evelyn turned away, fists clenched. She couldn’t bear another second.

But neither man moved.

Nathaniel’s final blow was a sneer. "Face it, Wilson. You’re irrelevant."

Gregory’s retort was cut off as Evelyn snapped, "I said OUT!"

Silence crackled.

Then, with a last searing glance, Nathaniel strode away. Gregory hesitated, regret flashing in his eyes before he followed.

The door clicked shut.

Alone, Evelyn exhaled shakily.

Their battle had left scars—and the war was far from over.

###Chapter 322 

Nathaniel's lips curled into a mocking smile. His tone carried an unmistakable warning, sharp enough to cut through steel.

Gregory's pulse stuttered. He opened his mouth to argue, but Evelyn cut him off with a glare. "Are you done? If so, get out." Her voice was icy, dripping with irritation.

Frustration boiled over. She snatched the folder from her desk and slammed it down with a resounding crack. The office fell deathly silent.

Three pairs of eyes locked in a tense standoff. Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Anything else? No? Then leave. I have work to do."

Gregory hesitated, his gaze flickering between her and Nathaniel. Finally, he turned on his heel.

At the door, he and Nathaniel exchanged a silent battle of wills. Gregory looked away first.

The door clicked shut. Only Evelyn and Nathaniel remained.

She kept her eyes fixed on the blueprint, refusing to acknowledge him. Her fingers tightened around her pen.

Nathaniel strode forward, planting himself in front of her desk. "You've been avoiding me," he accused. "Ever since Gregory confessed his feelings. That's why you're pushing me away, isn't it?"

Evelyn lifted her chin. "If that's what you believe, then nothing I say will change your mind."

His jaw clenched. "Explain."

"You want an answer? Fine. What exactly are you asking me?"

"I want the truth."

Silence stretched between them.

Nathaniel's voice dropped. "Evelyn, what's going on with you?" He searched his memory—no fights, no arguments. Just the Mitchell family drama they'd navigated together.

She swallowed the question burning her tongue—What about Isabella?—and deflected. "Nothing. Just the competition. It's consuming all my focus."

Nathaniel scoffed. "You expect me to believe a design contest turned you into this?"

"Believe what you want." Her tone was glacial.

The air turned suffocating. Neither would back down.

After a long pause, Nathaniel's eyes darkened. "If this competition is affecting you like this, don't participate. Withdraw now."

Evelyn's breath caught. "You're telling me to quit?"

###Chapter 323

Evelyn didn't flinch, her gaze locked onto Nathaniel's with unwavering intensity.

His voice dropped to a low murmur. "If this competition is affecting your emotions, your thoughts, and us, then I don't see why you should continue."

"Is that a threat?" Evelyn's tone was ice.

"A warning," he corrected. "You're pregnant. Stress isn't good for you—or the baby. Take some time to reconsider."

"For the baby?" A bitter smile flickered across her lips. "Or for you?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "You think this is about the baby?"

"Don't you?"

"Evelyn, even if you weren't pregnant, I wouldn't let you compete in this state."

Her laugh was sharp. "This competition is hosted by Martin Group, but every candidate earns their place. You're asking me to quit before I've even started. Is this really for my sake? Or are you just hiding behind some noble excuse because you're afraid of what my participation might do?"

The words cut deeper than she expected.

Despite Nathaniel's recent gentleness since learning of her pregnancy, the reminder of his control stung. A suffocating ache settled in her chest.

The argument escalated, tension thickening the air. Nathaniel was relentless; Evelyn refused to yield. His demands were clear. So was her defiance.

Then, his phone rang.

He strode to the window, answering with a clipped tone. Evelyn didn't bother listening. He'd come to her office under the pretense of picking her up, but this was just another ambush.

She shut down her computer, organizing files with deliberate calm.

When he returned, his expression was steel. "Evelyn, I’ve told you before—stay away from Gregory. He’s not who you think he is."

Her brows furrowed. "Did you come here to monitor my friendships? If so, you’ve said your piece. You can leave."

His eyes darkened. "What do you want from me, Evelyn? Do you expect me to stand by while you—"

"While I what? Make my own choices?" She met his glare. "I won’t be controlled, Nathaniel. Not by you. Not by anyone."

Silence.

They left the office without another word, the drive home just as tense.

Rosalind had dinner ready, but the heavy atmosphere didn’t escape her. Later, she quietly reported it to Victoria.

By midnight, Victoria was on her way to the apartment.

###Chapter 324 

Evelyn poured water and arranged fresh fruit for Nathaniel before returning to the dinner table.

Nathaniel frowned, his gaze fixed on Evelyn. "Have dinner with Evelyn. Stop staring," Victoria chided. He remained silent, but Victoria never spoke without reason. Something important must be brewing—yet unspoken. So he waited.

Nathaniel and Evelyn ate in complete silence, not a single word exchanged between them.

Victoria noticed immediately. They were definitely fighting.

As they finished their meal, Victoria took a brief stroll around the room. Evelyn set down her fork. Nathaniel began clearing the dishes, and Victoria smiled approvingly. "Nathaniel, Evelyn is pregnant now. You must take care of her. Handle all the chores—don’t let her lift a finger. Understood?"

Nathaniel didn’t respond, merely shooting her a glance.

Evelyn broke the tension. "Victoria, should we visit Beatrice now?"

"Of course."

They crossed to the neighboring apartment, gifts for Beatrice in hand.

By the time Nathaniel finished washing up and joined them, the room was already lively. No one paid him any attention.

Victoria was a natural conversationalist, effortlessly charming Beatrice. Both women were refined, their discussion pleasant and engaging.

An hour passed before Victoria made her move.

"Beatrice," she began, "Evelyn is pregnant, and the Martins are at fault here. Nathaniel and Evelyn have been married over a year without a proper wedding. Given her condition, we’ll have to wait until after the baby arrives. But I promise you—we will give Evelyn the wedding she deserves. Let’s start planning now, shall we? That way, we can prepare everything in advance. What do you think?"

Her tone was apologetic yet firm, impossible to dislike.

Beatrice blinked, caught off guard. A wedding discussion? Now? Her eyes darted to Evelyn. The room fell quiet.

Victoria pressed on. "Beatrice, please say something. If you agree, our families can meet for dinner and set a date."

"That depends on Evelyn and Nathaniel."

"Evelyn will follow your lead. As for Nathaniel—his marriage is decided by his father and me. His grandfather has a say too. It’s not his decision to make."

Just like that, Nathaniel—CEO of the Martin Group—was stripped of any authority in his own marriage.

Beatrice chuckled, then turned to Evelyn. "What do you think of Victoria’s suggestion?" She always let Evelyn make her own choices.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, voice calm. "Victoria, I’m pregnant. A wedding isn’t urgent. Even if we decide now, it’s just picking a date. There’s no rush."

"No rush?" Victoria gasped. "There’s everything to consider! The date, the venue, the dress, the catering—" She whirled toward Nathaniel. "Speak up. What’s your opinion?"

"You said my opinion doesn’t matter."

"Don’t be difficult. What do you think?"

Nathaniel’s eyes locked onto Evelyn. "Whatever."

"Meaning?"

"The wedding can happen whenever."

Victoria beamed. "See, Evelyn? Nathaniel is eager to marry you properly."

Evelyn’s expression remained blank. "Victoria, I still think we should wait. Let’s discuss this after the baby is born. Who knows what the future holds?"

Her words hung in the air, heavy with unspoken tension.

###Chapter 325

Evelyn's response struck the room into stunned silence.

The air grew so thick you could hear a pin drop. No one dared to speak. All eyes turned to her, but she remained composed, her expression unreadable.

Nearly thirty seconds passed before Nathaniel finally broke the tension. "She's made her decision. Respect it." His voice was firm.

"Darling—" Victoria began, but Nathaniel cut her off. "Beatrice, would you mind keeping Mother company? I have urgent matters to attend to."

"Of course," Beatrice replied quickly, sensing the friction between her granddaughter and Nathaniel.

Once he left, Victoria lowered her voice. "Evelyn, tell me honestly—has Nathaniel done something to upset you? Whatever it is, I'll set him straight. You mustn't hold back. We're here to support you, always."

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips.

"You're mistaken, Victoria. There's no quarrel between us. Just... differing perspectives."

"Are you certain?"

"Absolutely."

Despite Evelyn's reassurances, Victoria remained unconvinced. The tension between them was palpable.

Failing to extract answers from Evelyn, Victoria excused herself to confront Nathaniel.

The moment they were alone, Beatrice leaned in. "Now, tell me the truth. What's really going on between you two?"

Evelyn exhaled. "Grandmother, it's nothing serious. Just work-related disagreements."

"Truthfully?"

"I wouldn't lie to you."

Beatrice studied her before shifting topics. "Victoria suggested setting a wedding date. Why did you refuse?"

Evelyn's gaze dropped.

After a beat, Beatrice pressed, "Are you still considering leaving him?"

Evelyn lifted her eyes, vulnerability flickering in them. "May I ask you something?"

"Of course."

"If I weren't pregnant... would I still be trapped in this marriage?"

Gregory's words earlier had struck a chord. Evelyn refused to let pregnancy define her future. Staying in a loveless marriage for the baby's sake would only destroy her belief in love—something she'd never compromise on.

###Chapter 326 

Evelyn sat beside Beatrice, quietly reading a book. Meanwhile, Victoria kept pressing Nathaniel about his ongoing tension with Evelyn.

Nathaniel's patience wore thin. "Stay out of our business. As for the wedding, I'll handle it. Now isn't the right time, so drop it."

"Not the right time? When will it be? When Evelyn finally walks away?" Victoria challenged.

Nathaniel's gaze darkened. "That won't happen."

Evelyn carried his child. She could be upset, but leaving? Impossible.

Victoria scoffed. "You don’t control everything, Nathaniel. If Evelyn decides she’s done, you’ll regret it."

Frustrated, she stood abruptly. "Take Evelyn to Martin Manor in two days. Edward misses her. The Mitchells faced trouble, and we did nothing. Think about how that looks."

With that, she stormed out.

Nathaniel remained on the sofa, motionless.

Was Evelyn upset about the Martins' lack of support?

He dismissed the thought. If she needed help, she’d ask. She wasn’t the type to sulk.

But something was bothering her.

He grabbed his phone and dialed Samuel. "Dig into Isabella’s recent activities. Find out if she’s contacted Evelyn."

Samuel responded promptly. "Anything else, Mr. Martin?"

"Has her contract promotion started?"

"Not yet. She’s still in training."

"Good." Nathaniel’s voice turned icy. "Visit her personally. Remind her of the contract terms."

"Understood."

Nathaniel hesitated, then added, "Tell her manager to watch her closely."

The front door clicked open.

Evelyn stood frozen in the doorway, her expression unreadable.

She inhaled sharply, shut the door softly, and walked in without a word.

Nathaniel ended the call and met her gaze.

Silence stretched between them.

"Clear your schedule," he finally said. "We’re visiting Edward in two days."

"Fine." Her tone was flat.

His jaw tightened. "Nothing else to say?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "Do you?"

His temper flared. "Why refuse the wedding? Afraid it’ll ruin your chances with your ex?"

Her lips curved slightly, almost mocking. "Or are you worried Isabella might cry and break your heart?"

###Chapter 327

Their gazes locked in a silent battle of wills, neither willing to yield.

After a tense pause, Nathaniel's lips curled into a chilling smile. "So what you're saying is, you're refusing to have a wedding because you're worried about hurting your ex's feelings? Is that why you're sabotaging our future?"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed slightly, her expression unreadable.

"If that's what you choose to believe," she said quietly, "then yes. It's not like my denial would change your mind anyway."

"Nathaniel, what exactly are you accusing me of?" Her voice remained steady, but her chest tightened. "Have you convinced yourself I'm already packing my bags to run back to him?"

His distrust cut deeper than any blade.

But she refused to justify herself.

If he'd already decided who she was, no words would change that.

Evelyn pressed her lips together and turned away. Before she could retreat, his hand closed around her wrist like a steel cuff.

She yanked back, but he pinned her against the wall in one fluid motion. His breath was hot against her skin as he studied her face—then claimed her mouth without mercy.

The kiss was cold, punishing. She pushed against his chest, but his arms were immovable. The more she struggled, the tighter he held her, until her body went slack from lack of air. Her fingers twisted into his shirt as the world spun.

When he finally released her, Evelyn gasped, her glare burning with fury.

Nathaniel merely smirked. "Tell me, Evelyn—do you provoke me because you think pregnancy makes you untouchable? Is that your new shield?"

Her brows knitted together as she shoved at him. "Get away from me."

"Answer the question." He caught her chin, forcing her to meet his eyes. Instead of backing off, he leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Is. That. It?"

Evelyn's jaw tensed.

"Why do you always twist my silence into guilt?" Her voice was eerily calm. "If you've already tried and convicted me in your head, why ask for my defense? Would you even listen?"

The room fell silent.

A bitter laugh escaped her. "You accuse me of hiding our marriage for my ex's sake? Then what about you, Nathaniel? Has my past ever interfered with us? No. But Isabella still has a key to your life. So tell me—who's really being unreasonable here?"

She wasn't one to dredge up old wounds. But his constant suspicion had worn her down.

Her ex had been nothing more than a passing excuse, yet Nathaniel had turned him into a ghost haunting their marriage. She stared at the floor, her face carefully blank.

Nathaniel watched her, his expression unreadable. When he finally spoke, his voice was softer. "So all this time... it's been about Isabella?"

Evelyn said nothing.

His fingers brushed her cheek. "I haven't seen or spoken to Isabella. Whatever you heard—whatever you think you saw—you could've asked me first. Jumping to conclusions like this..." His thumb traced her lower lip. "Don't you think you're the one crossing the line now?"

###Chapter 328 

"Am I being unreasonable?" Evelyn let out a bitter, hollow laugh. "Nathaniel, you've poured every resource into promoting Isabella without even mentioning it to me. With the Martin Group's vast resources, are you telling me she's the only talented singer out there? Is she truly that irreplaceable?"

To Evelyn, no contact meant exactly that—no calls, no texts, no professional entanglements.

But now that Isabella was signed under the Martin Group, how could that possibly count as no contact?

Nathaniel's expression darkened, his voice dropping to a low murmur. "It's not what you think. Isabella's contract with Martin Group is purely business. As for why she was chosen... I can't explain everything right now. But you need to know—the only person in my heart is you. Understand?"

The only person in his heart was her?

That line used to make her heart flutter.

Not anymore.

She wouldn’t let it.

She refused to be swayed by empty words.

His tenderness might be given freely, but his sincerity had always belonged to Isabella. So she steeled herself, repeating inwardly, "Evelyn, stay sharp. Even if he cares for you now, it’s only because of the baby."

She forced a faint smile. "Nathaniel, I get it. If you don’t want to explain, I won’t push. Whoever holds your heart is none of my concern."

With that, she tried to step past him, putting distance between them.

But he didn’t move. His hand shot out, gripping her wrist, his voice dangerously quiet. "Evelyn, what do you mean, none of your concern?"

"Exactly what it sounds like."

"So you wouldn’t care if there were other women in my heart?" His tone turned icy.

She met his gaze evenly. "What difference would it make? I can’t control your feelings. If I said no, would you actually listen?"

Nathaniel scoffed, his grip tightening. "I underestimated you, Evelyn. Not only are you heartless, but ungrateful too. Do you really not see why I’ve done everything I have lately?"

His eyes narrowed, his face a mask of displeasure.

Evelyn froze.

She stared at him, stunned, her lips parting slightly but no words coming out.

What was he implying? Was there something he wasn’t saying?

But after so many disappointments, after so many answers she didn’t want to hear, she couldn’t bring herself to ask.

She pressed her lips together and stayed silent.

The air between them grew heavy.

Then—his phone rang.

He released her only then, pulling out his phone with a sharp, irritated motion.

"Speak," he snapped into the phone.

There was a brief pause before Samuel’s voice came through. "Mr. Martin, we’ve just received footage related to the Mitchell Group. After Victor Mills was arrested, Mrs. Martin instructed us to monitor his associates. His wife has shown no unusual behavior—until now. A man just picked her up in a car."

"Who?" Nathaniel demanded, his voice cold.

###Chapter 329

"No, he was careful. All we know is it was a man. Our team pursued them, but they lost us after realizing they were being followed."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. His gaze flickered toward Evelyn briefly before he spoke. "If they risked exposure to meet her, she must be important. Why else would they act so recklessly at this crucial time?"

Samuel agreed, prompting him to contact Nathaniel immediately.

"Mr. Martin, should we keep surveillance?"

"Pointless. They won't return now that they've been compromised. Investigate everyone close to Victor's wife. If nothing turns up, drop it. And send me the footage."

"Understood, sir."

The call ended, and Samuel forwarded the video.

Evelyn caught Nathaniel mentioning Victor. Her attention snapped to him. Their eyes met, and he stated calmly, "Victor's wife has been taken."

Her breath hitched. "By whom?"

"Unknown. Samuel sent the recording."

He played the brief clip—less than a minute—before passing his phone to her.

A man in black, wearing a cap with an 'M' emblem, escorted Victor's wife with a suitcase before driving off.

Evelyn replayed it, searching for clues. Nothing stood out, yet the man unsettled her inexplicably.

She handed the phone back, her tone flat. "Let it go. I don’t want any part of this."

The Mitchells didn’t need her involvement. With Victor arrested, the matter was settled. As for her father’s silence, she wouldn’t push further.

The investigation halted—officially.

But Nathaniel still instructed Samuel to monitor developments.

Night fell after their argument.

Evelyn showered and lay in bed, waiting. Nathaniel didn’t come. His words replayed in her mind until sleep claimed her.

When he finally entered, he found her asleep. He resisted waking her, merely brushing his thumb over her cheek.

"Only you could torment me like this," he murmured, smiling faintly before pressing a kiss to her temple.

Morning came.

Evelyn arrived at work, determined to continue her competition entry despite Nathaniel’s suggestion to withdraw.

She refined her designs, intending to consult Gregory—but he hadn’t arrived.

She hesitated to call, wary of provoking Danielle. Instead, she asked his secretary, "Is Mr. Wilson out today?"

"He called last night. Said he had personal matters and wouldn’t be in until afternoon."

Evelyn nodded. Danielle again.

###Chapter 330

Having a sister like Danielle was utterly draining.

Gregory and the Wilsons shared an adoptive bond. Danielle wasn't his biological sister, but her domineering personality made every interaction exhausting. Even Evelyn, an outsider, found her behavior appallingly rude. Yet Gregory always tolerated it.

Since Gregory hadn't arrived at the office yet, Evelyn busied herself with other tasks.

At lunch, she mechanically ate a takeout meal while checking her phone repeatedly. She fought the urge to message Nathaniel, though her fingers itched to type.

Across town, Nathaniel mirrored her restlessness.

During the morning executive meeting, he'd sat icily silent. The management team tiptoed around him, recognizing his stormy mood. Experience taught them silence was safest when Mr. Martin wore that expression.

Back in his office, Nathaniel kept glancing at his phone.

Samuel noticed. "Is everything alright, Mr. Martin?"

Nathaniel's glare could freeze lava. "Do I pay you to psychoanalyze me? Get back to work."

Samuel ducked his head, absorbing the verbal slap. With a dismissive wave, Nathaniel banished him.

Leaning back in his leather chair, Nathaniel's mood remained foul. The afternoon sun did nothing to warm his demeanor.

Meanwhile, Evelyn napped briefly at her desk.

At 2:15pm, she went searching for Gregory.

"Has Mr. Wilson returned?" she asked his secretary.

"He just arrived."

Evelyn grabbed her laptop and knocked on Gregory's door.

"Where were you?" she asked upon entering.

Gregory's response was vague. "Some personal matters."

"Danielle again?"

He nodded, then deflected. "Did you need something?"

"I need your input on the competition drafts. The framework's done but needs refining."

Though Gregory couldn't sketch, his architectural insights were razor-sharp. They spent hours perfecting the designs, carefully avoiding yesterday's explosive topic.

At day's end, they walked to the parking garage together. Passing Gregory's car, he mentioned, "My parents sent Dresden specialties. Meant to give them yesterday, but... circumstances prevented it."

Evelyn understood the unspoken reference to Nathaniel.

"Share them with Danielle," she demurred.

"They're for you." Gregory opened his trunk, revealing boxes of tart Dresden berries he'd sourced specifically to tempt Evelyn's pregnancy-diminished appetite.

As Evelyn thanked him, her gaze snagged on something in the trunk. Her expression frosted over.

Gregory followed her stare. "What is it?"

"Is that your hat?"

The cap bore the distinctive 'M' logo - identical to the one in Samuel's damning video.
###Chapter 331

Gregory's gaze lingered, avoiding the question. "What's wrong?" he countered instead.

Evelyn studied him carefully. "Nothing serious. I was just wondering...where did you get that hat?"

"Danielle bought it," he shrugged. "She insisted I wear it. Didn't want to upset her, so I left it in the car."

"I see."

"Does it bother you?" Gregory asked casually, his eyes never leaving her face.

Evelyn offered a faint smile. "Not at all. It just doesn't seem like your style, that's all."

"Agreed," he echoed.

The conversation lapsed into silence before Gregory changed topics. "Take these groceries home. If Nathaniel asks, just say you ordered them online. Saves you the trouble."

She understood his meaning perfectly. "That's thoughtful of you, but why lie? I appreciate the gesture."

"I don't want to cause problems between you two."

"You won't."

"Alright then. You should head back—it's getting late. I need to take Danielle to her therapy session. She's been resistant, so I told her we're just meeting a friend."

Evelyn nodded. "Thank you."

Gregory watched her drive away before getting into his own car. His gentle expression vanished instantly.

Meanwhile, Evelyn's thoughts churned. That hat in Gregory's trunk haunted her.

Back at the penthouse, she went straight to Samuel. "Can you send me last night's footage again? I need to review it."

The video arrived immediately. Evelyn scrutinized it multiple times but reached the same conclusion. Many people owned similar hats—was she overthinking this?

Guilt gnawed at her. How could she doubt someone who'd been nothing but kind?

The front door opened, interrupting her thoughts. Nathaniel stood there. Their eyes locked.

"Samuel said you wanted the footage," he said. "Find anything?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Just wanted another look."

Nathaniel nodded silently.

Though they weren't fighting anymore, their conversations remained sparse and formal. Even meals passed in near silence, the atmosphere heavy with unspoken words.

Morning came. Evelyn woke to an empty bed. After getting ready, she found no trace of Nathaniel.

"Rosalind, where's Nathaniel?" she asked the cook.

"He left early—probably went to the office."

Evelyn checked the clock. Too early for his usual schedule. Strange, but she didn't call to inquire.

After breakfast, she crossed to her grandmother's residence. "Mrs. Beatrice is still resting," the caregiver informed her. "Come back later."

Evelyn smiled. "Grandmother slept in?"

"Stayed up reading. She's already eaten breakfast and wants to sleep more."

Evelyn headed to work, unaware her grandmother wasn't sleeping at all—she was at the hospital with Nathaniel.

Today was Beatrice's long-delayed physical. Originally scheduled during the Mitchell family crisis, Dr. Harrison had rescheduled it for today. Nathaniel accompanied her through the exhaustive hour-long examination. By the end, Beatrice looked drained.
###Chapter 332 

Dr. Harrison arranged for a nurse to accompany Mrs. Beatrice to his office to rest. Then he and Nathaniel stepped out onto the balcony outside the examination room.

Nathaniel's voice was tight. "How bad is it?"

"Not good. It's a severe cardiac condition. To manage it, she'll need a transplant, but the risks are high. Even if successful, her age complicates recovery." Dr. Harrison's tone left no room for optimism.

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. Silence stretched between them.

"Should we inform Evelyn?" Dr. Harrison suggested. "Her grandmother means everything to her. Keeping this secret might backfire."

"Beatrice specifically asked me to bring her here because she didn’t want Evelyn to know." Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "She’s pregnant. The stress could harm her—and the baby."

But if Evelyn discovered the truth later, her fury would be unmatched.

Nathaniel rubbed his temples. "Does she already know about her condition?"

"She does. Bloodwork shows she's been on painkillers and heart medication. The disease is advanced. If we proceed with surgery, it needs to happen soon—before the meds lose effectiveness."

Nathaniel gave a stiff nod. "Let me speak with her first."

"Understood."

Nathaniel escorted Beatrice out of the office, guiding her to the hospital gardens. The afternoon sun cast long shadows over the manicured hedges.

Noticing his tension, Beatrice smiled gently. "Why so grim, Nathaniel?"

His gaze darkened. "You knew, didn’t you?"

Her secrecy had tipped him off. If it weren’t serious, she wouldn’t have hidden it from Evelyn.

Beatrice patted his arm. "At my age, death isn’t frightening. I only hid this because Evelyn is carrying my great-grandchild. I won’t let my health ruin her joy. Seeing her married and starting a family is enough for me."

Her words carved deeper lines into Nathaniel’s expression.

"You’re everything to her," he said hoarsely. "If you give up, it’ll destroy her. She wants you healthy. We’ll follow Dr. Harrison’s plan—surgery, recovery. You’ll hold that baby in your arms."

Beatrice shook her head, resolute. "No surgery. My heart won’t last, no matter what. Let nature take its course. And Nathaniel—don’t tell Evelyn. Not until after the birth."

His laugh was brittle. "If she finds out I kept this from her, she’ll never forgive me."

Beatrice’s eyes twinkled. "Then you’ll have to be very convincing, won’t you?"

Nathaniel groaned.

###Chapter 333

Beatrice still refused to tell Evelyn the truth. In the end, Nathaniel had no choice but to reluctantly agree.

But it wasn’t just for Evelyn’s pregnancy. Dr. Harrison had warned him—Beatrice’s age made surgery risky. Her health came first.

After their conversation, Nathaniel and Beatrice left the hospital together.

Unseen, a woman stepped out from behind the garden pavilion. Sunglasses hid her eyes, but her smirk was unmistakable.

She had only come to maintain her perfect image. But fate had handed her something far more valuable.

Without a word, she turned and walked away.

Evelyn arrived at the office early and called Gabrielle, Liam, and Maxwell in.

The four of them spent the morning buried in drafts. With three sharp minds, corrections were quick. Evelyn barely needed to double-check.

By noon, they were done.

"Lunch is on me," Evelyn said, ordering from Scarlett’s.

Gabrielle grinned. "Working for you is the best, Ms. Mitchell!"

The others chimed in. "Perks everywhere!"

Evelyn smirked. "Enjoy it. But don’t slack off."

Kindness and discipline—that’s how a boss stayed respected.

The office phone rang.

Evelyn picked up. "Hello?"

"It’s me. Isabella."

Evelyn’s expression cooled. "What do you want?"

"I have something you’ll really want to hear."

"Unlikely."

Isabella’s voice dripped with amusement. "Don’t be so sure. This is life-changing. Ignore it, and you’ll regret it forever."

"Spit it out."

"Was your grandmother home this morning?"

Evelyn’s grip tightened on the phone. She flicked a glance at Gabrielle, who ushered the others out.

"What are you implying?"

Isabella laughed. "Oh, so now you’re curious? Fine. I saw her at the hospital. With Nathaniel. She’s sick—really sick. Refusing surgery. And they’re keeping it from you."

A pause. Then, mock sympathy. "Poor Evelyn. Too busy with your baby to notice your own family crumbling?"

Evelyn’s voice was ice. "If you’re lying—"

"Why would I? But hey, don’t take my word for it. Ask Nathaniel. If he even lets you."

The line went dead.

Evelyn stared at the phone, her pulse roaring in her ears.

She would find out the truth.

No matter what it took.

###Chapter 334 Trust

Isabella's words had barely left her lips when Evelyn ended the call abruptly.

Her vision blurred as she sank into deep thought.

Though Isabella wasn’t entirely reliable, the fact that Nathaniel had left for the company at dawn and Beatrice had gone back to sleep seemed far too coincidental. Evelyn pressed her lips into a tight line and immediately stood from her desk.

She quickly briefed Gabrielle on the afternoon’s tasks before driving straight to Martin Group headquarters.

She needed answers about Beatrice’s condition—otherwise, she wouldn’t be able to focus on anything else.

As for Isabella’s accusation that she was neglecting her grandmother for the sake of her pregnancy, it was absurd.

When Evelyn arrived, Nathaniel was already seated at his desk, having been informed of her visit.

He studied her with a calm gaze. "What brings you here this time?" Their interactions had been sparse lately, so her sudden appearance wasn’t without reason. But Nathaniel’s composure gave nothing away.

Evelyn met his eyes directly. "Nathaniel, I need to ask you something. Have you been keeping things from me?"

His brow furrowed slightly. "Why would you think that? Who told you something?"

"Just answer me. Have you been hiding anything?"

"No." His response was firm, his gaze steady.

A cold smirk twisted Evelyn’s lips. "Really?"

Nathaniel didn’t flinch. "Evelyn, what exactly do you want to know?"

Her chest tightened.

He knew exactly what she was asking—yet he refused to be honest.

"Did you take Grandma to the hospital today?"

His silence was confirmation enough.

Her expression turned icy. "You knew her condition was worsening, but you didn’t tell me. Is it because you’re afraid worrying about her would harm the baby?"

Nathaniel’s face darkened. "Evelyn, do you really think so little of me? Do you believe I can’t prioritize what matters?"

She stared at him, an unfamiliar ache spreading through her chest.

He exhaled sharply. "Yes, I went with Beatrice today. She told me about this when we first arrived in Marseille, but Dr. Harrison’s schedule delayed the appointment. Her condition isn’t good, but she insists on conservative treatment—she’s too old for surgery and doesn’t want you worrying. But Evelyn, I’m not the heartless man you’re making me out to be. I would never force you to choose between our child and your grandmother."

Evelyn’s shoulders slumped, the fight draining from her.

After a long pause, she whispered, "I’m sorry."

Nathaniel’s anger softened at her defeated tone.

He stepped closer, pulling her into his arms. His voice was low, almost pleading. "Just trust me a little, okay?"

Tears glistened in her eyes, but she refused to let them fall.

"I want Grandma to have the surgery. I don’t want to give up."

"Then we won’t." His grip tightened. "As long as you’re sure, I’m with you."

She looked up, their gazes locking.

For the first time in days, she let herself lean into him.
###Chapter 335

Evelyn melted into Nathaniel's embrace, her restless heart finding momentary peace.

"Okay," she murmured softly.

The room fell silent as they held each other, the warmth between them a quiet comfort.

Later, Nathaniel left work early to accompany Evelyn to the hospital. Dr. Harrison laid out the options—conservative treatment with a longer recovery, or surgery with higher risks but better potential outcomes.

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. "We’ll do the surgery."

Hope was all she had left.

Now, they just needed Beatrice’s consent.

That evening, they arrived at Beatrice’s home, their expressions grave.

Beatrice already knew.

"Will agreeing to this ease your mind?" Beatrice asked quietly.

Evelyn nodded. "I want you here with me. Please, let’s take this chance."

Beatrice smiled, wordless.

Though not bound by blood, their bond was unshakable.

Finally, Beatrice agreed.

The next day, she was admitted. Evelyn arranged for her usual caretaker to stay, visiting after work herself. They still needed a donor match—hospitalization was just preparation.

After seeing Beatrice, Evelyn and Nathaniel met with Dr. Harrison again.

No matches yet.

Evelyn’s chest tightened.

Nathaniel squeezed her hand. "We’ll find one."

She forced a nod.

That night, while Nathaniel showered, Evelyn stepped onto the balcony and dialed an overseas number.

"I need your help," she said quietly. "Find a heart for my grandmother."

The voice on the other end responded immediately. "Consider it done."

Evelyn stood there long after the call ended, the night air cool against her skin.

Nathaniel found her there.

He wrapped his arms around her from behind, his warmth seeping into her.

"Talk to me," he murmured against her ear.

Evelyn exhaled. "I’m fine."

He turned her to face him, his gaze searching. "Then why do you look like you’re carrying the world?"

Her voice wavered. "I just... feel guilty."

Guilty for not noticing sooner.

Guilty for failing her.
###Chapter 336 

Nathaniel gently traced Evelyn's cheek with his thumb before leaning in to kiss her. Lately, he couldn't seem to get enough of her lips.

Evelyn froze, her lashes fluttering in surprise.

"The reason Beatrice didn’t tell you," Nathaniel murmured, pulling back slightly, "was because she didn’t want you to blame yourself. If you keep thinking like this, she’ll sense it—and that’s the last thing she needs before surgery. So, let it go, alright?" His words eased the tightness in her chest.

Life had to move forward. Especially now that Beatrice had agreed to the operation.

Feeling lighter, Evelyn decided to visit the hospital after work. Nathaniel promised to pick her up so they could return to the penthouse together.

That evening, as planned, Evelyn finished her shift and headed to the hospital. She had already texted Nathaniel earlier: Dinner at Scarlett tonight? He confirmed, setting their meet-up for six.

But at half past five, Isabella walked into Martin Group headquarters, derailing Nathaniel’s entire evening.

She requested to see him through Samuel, who reluctantly escorted her to the office.

As one of Martin Group’s contracted artists, Isabella’s presence wasn’t unusual. The only difference? She no longer had direct access to Nathaniel. Now, she needed approval—a fact that chafed at her pride, but she swallowed it.

Once inside, she wasted no time. "Nathaniel, we found a heart match for my mother."

His expression remained impassive. "Good. The doctors can proceed with the transplant."

She bit her lip. "Do you… not want to see me anymore?"

"You're imagining things." His tone was flat.

Isabella pressed on. "I know about Beatrice’s condition. I don’t want you to worry, so I have a proposal."

Nathaniel watched her, silent.

"I’m willing to offer my mother’s heart for Beatrice’s match. If it’s compatible, Beatrice can have the surgery first."

His gaze darkened. "You’d give up your mother’s heart for Beatrice?"

She nodded.

A faint, humorless smile touched his lips. "Why, Isabella? Just to ease my worries?"

"Yes. And to thank you for everything you’ve done for me. Of course, I love my mother—but her condition is stable. Beatrice needs it more. So, if the match works, she should go first."

"Is that all?"

"That’s all." She stepped closer. "You might not believe me, but I mean it. I want to help you."

Nathaniel studied her for a long moment before finally agreeing.

Since the heart belonged to Isabella’s mother, her consent was required. With Dr. Harrison overseeing the process, the compatibility results came back almost immediately—positive.

Just as Nathaniel was about to call Evelyn with the news, Isabella spoke again.

"Nathaniel, don’t you see? Fate is giving us a sign. If we weren’t meant to be, this match wouldn’t have worked. But it did. Doesn’t that mean something?"

His voice turned icy. "What are you implying?"

She lifted her chin. "Divorce Evelyn. Marry me instead, and I’ll donate the heart to Beatrice. Do we have a deal?"

###Chapter 337

Isabella's words finally made Nathaniel understand her intention. She had been waiting here for him all along.

Did she think she had leverage? Something to hold over him? Nathaniel's gaze turned icy as he studied her, his voice dripping with cold detachment. "Isabella, do you really believe I would agree to your demands?"

Isabella faltered. She wasn’t sure anymore.

She couldn’t meet his eyes, forcing herself to remain composed as she whispered, "Nathaniel, you wouldn’t want Evelyn to suffer, would you? If you just agree, it’s the best outcome. You promised to marry me first—you broke that promise."

"Broke my promise?" A humorless laugh escaped him. "And what about the contract you signed?"

She hesitated before murmuring, "I admit I signed it. I accept that. But now, if you want Beatrice to have the surgery as soon as possible, you have to agree to my terms."

A scoff. "Do you honestly think I’ll bend to your will?" His stare was sharp, laced with quiet fury.

Isabella didn’t dare answer, her breath shallow.

Nathaniel’s voice dropped lower, dangerous. "Isabella Davis, don’t test me like this. The power has always been mine. I warned you—if you want to burn the last shred of affection between us, just say so. You don’t need these pathetic attempts to force my hand. Once it’s gone, you mean nothing to me. So tell me—are you sure?"

Her eyes widened. She couldn’t speak.

Nathaniel tilted his head, his expression unreadable. "Do you think I need your permission for a heart? Even if the surgery has already started, I can still take it away. Would you like to see me try?"

"Nathaniel, I—I was wrong." Her voice trembled. "It was stupid of me to test you like this. Please, forgive me. I won’t do it again."

She crumbled instantly.

She had no courage left. No defiance.

Nathaniel didn’t spare her another glance. He turned and walked away without another word.

Watching his retreating figure, Isabella’s hands clenched into fists. His cruelty cut deep. She loved him—why couldn’t he even look at her?

It was all Evelyn’s fault.

If not for Evelyn, they would be married by now. Maybe even have a child.

They could have been happy.

Evelyn ruined everything.

She hated her.

Outside the hospital, Nathaniel slid into the car. Samuel already knew the test results. "Mr. Martin, is this heart for Beatrice?"

"Evelyn would never accept it." Even if it was taken for Beatrice, knowing it came from Isabella’s mother would torment her.

Besides, Isabella and her mother weren’t even blood-related. If she was willing to use her own mother’s life as leverage, she had no conscience. And Nathaniel refused to stoop to that level.

Leaning back, he closed his eyes. "Any updates on finding a match?"

"We’re searching everywhere—domestically, internationally. But hearts aren’t easy to come by."

Nathaniel glanced out the window, his expression softening. "Hurry. I don’t want her carrying guilt over this."

"Understood." Samuel knew exactly who he meant.

When they reached the apartment, Evelyn had already showered and was revising her blueprints.
###Chapter 338 

Evelyn was so engrossed in her work that she didn’t notice Nathaniel’s presence until his arms wrapped around her from behind.

She stiffened, then wrinkled her nose. "You went to the hospital?"

Nathaniel paused, surprised by her sharp senses.

"Are you tracking me now?" he teased.

"That’s the smell of antiseptic clinging to you."

He smirked, pinching her cheek. "What are you, a bloodhound?"

She shot him a dry look. "You’re the one who smells like a hospital."

His grin widened. "If I am, then so are you."

"Go shower. You reek."

He chuckled, stepping closer until their breaths mingled. The faint floral scent of her perfume made his grip tighten around her waist.

His voice dropped low. "Already pushing me away? That’s cold."

"Let go."

"Not even a quick hug? You’re ruthless."

"Nathaniel."

"I’m right here." His tone softened at her sharpness.

Evelyn exhaled, baffled.

What had gotten into him? He’d been unusually clingy all evening.

With the architectural competition less than a week away, Evelyn’s schedule was packed. She spent hours meticulously reviewing every blueprint, ensuring no errors slipped through. Her dedication didn’t go unnoticed—even her three assistants worked harder, learning from her precision.

After wrapping up her morning tasks, she headed to the hospital with lunch for Beatrice, carefully selecting light, nutritious dishes from Scarlett.

Stepping off the elevator, she nearly collided with Isabella.

Even behind oversized sunglasses, Evelyn recognized her instantly.

This was their first encounter since Isabella’s call about Beatrice’s condition. Neither spoke, their expressions icy as they sized each other up. Evelyn moved to walk past her.

Isabella blocked her path, lips curling. "Evelyn, your grandmother’s getting treatment now. Shouldn’t you thank me? Without my call, you’d still be clueless."

Evelyn stopped, meeting her gaze evenly.

Half true, half twisted.

Yes, Isabella had informed her—but not out of kindness. It was a calculated move to drive a wedge between her and Nathaniel.

Evelyn’s voice turned frosty. "We both know why you did it. Do you really expect gratitude?"

Isabella’s smirk faltered. "Ungrateful. Who knows what state Beatrice would be in without me?"

"Should we argue here?" Evelyn countered coolly. "Let the whole hospital hear how disgusting you are?"

Isabella stiffened. As a public figure, she couldn’t afford a scene.

After a beat, she leaned in, lowering her voice. "I didn’t come to fight. Beatrice needs a heart transplant. Did you know Nathaniel got tested last night?" Her smile turned predatory. "The matching heart? It’s mine. Do you want it?"

###Chapter 339

Evelyn's eyes widened abruptly, locking onto Isabella with an intense gaze. "What are you implying?"

"Was I not clear? Didn’t Nathaniel tell you last night?" A smirk played on Isabella’s lips as she tilted her head, her tone dripping with deliberate provocation.

She wanted Evelyn to know—there was another secret between her and Nathaniel, one Evelyn wasn’t privy to.

Evelyn’s expression darkened, her voice cool. "Why should I trust you?"

It was true—she had agreed to dinner with Nathaniel last night. But he’d canceled abruptly, claiming urgent business, sending her home after her visit with Beatrice.

Yet he had met Isabella instead.

And then he’d returned to the apartment, suddenly affectionate.

The pieces didn’t fit.

If Nathaniel had arranged the matching test, why keep it from her?

Evelyn’s gaze turned icy as she studied Isabella’s smug face.

Isabella, however, didn’t wait for a response. She pulled out the matching report and thrust it into Evelyn’s hands. "Convinced now?"

Evelyn stared at the results, her fingers tightening around the paper. The numbers blurred before her eyes.

A perfect match.

Her stomach twisted.

Isabella’s voice cut through the silence, smooth and calculated. "Evelyn, if you want Beatrice to get that heart transplant soon, I can give it to you. But I have a condition."

Evelyn didn’t ask about the condition. Instead, her voice was sharp. "This heart matches your mother’s. Are you really willing to sacrifice her?"

Isabella’s smile faltered for a fraction of a second before she recovered. "That’s my business. You just need to decide—do you want to save Beatrice or not? She’s old. Her health is deteriorating. If you refuse me, how long do you think she can wait for another match?"

"Unlike you, Isabella, I don’t trade lives for personal gain. Not even my own grandmother’s."

Isabella laughed, cold and mocking. "You call me selfish? Look at yourself. You’d rather let Beatrice suffer than give up Nathaniel. Do you know how rare a match like this is? Walk away now, and you might never get another chance."

She leaned in, her voice a venomous whisper.

"All you have to do is divorce him. Let me marry him. Then Beatrice gets the heart. Simple, isn’t it?"

Evelyn recoiled.

So that was her game.

She wanted Nathaniel.

Disgust curled in Evelyn’s chest. "Isabella, no matter what you say, I’ll never agree. Your schemes are pathetic. Neither I nor Beatrice want anything from you. Leave. Now."

Isabella’s fists clenched, fury flashing in her eyes. But then, slowly, she smiled again.

"Fine. But before you go… let me tell you a secret."

Her voice dropped to a whisper.

"Do you know why Sebastian wanted to kidnap you?"

###Chapter 340 

Evelyn's face drained of color instantly. Her eyes widened involuntarily as she fixed a frigid stare on Isabella. "How do you know about this? Did you have something to do with it?"

Isabella remained silent, her lips curling into a victorious smirk.

Seeing Evelyn unravel gave her immense satisfaction.

Her eyes crinkled with amusement, her voice laced with barely contained laughter. "Actually, Nathaniel has known about this connection for a long time. But he won’t act on it—because my place in his heart goes far beyond what you can imagine. Do you believe me?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together. Her chest tightened painfully, as if an invisible hand had seized her heart, squeezing until she could barely breathe.

She regarded Isabella with icy detachment, her gaze so devoid of emotion it was chilling. "Is that so? If he cares about you that much, why come to me? Shouldn’t you be running straight to him instead? Or are you telling me all this because Nathaniel won’t give you the time of day?"

Isabella’s smile faltered.

Evelyn tilted her head, a knowing smirk playing on her lips. "Did I hit a nerve?"

Isabella scoffed. "Don’t flatter yourself, Evelyn. You were almost... ruined, weren’t you? Yet here you are, still enduring it. You’ll never measure up to me. In Nathaniel’s heart, I will always matter more."

Evelyn narrowed her eyes but didn’t respond. She studied Isabella carefully, her mind racing.

She hadn’t figured this out yet. She wouldn’t take Isabella’s word for it—she needed to hear the truth from Nathaniel himself.

After having lunch with Beatrice at the hospital, Evelyn didn’t linger. She headed straight to the Martin Group.

Her mood was visibly off, and Beatrice noticed. Assuming it was due to the heart compatibility results, Beatrice tried to reassure her. "What’s troubling you? Even I, the one directly involved, am not stressing over it. Why are you?"

Evelyn forced a smile and shook her head. "You’ve misunderstood. It’s just work—the competition is coming up, and it’s giving me a headache."

"Just do your best. The result isn’t what matters."

"You’re right." Evelyn’s smile deepened, though it didn’t reach her eyes.

The entire ride to the Martin Group was spent in silence, her expression frosty, devoid of warmth.

When she arrived on Nathaniel’s floor, it was Samuel who greeted her. Her tone was clipped. "Where’s Nathaniel?"

Samuel immediately sensed her dark mood. "Mr. Martin is in his office—"

Before he could finish, Evelyn was already striding toward the office.

Samuel watched her retreating figure, silently deciding it might be best to steer clear of the office for the rest of the day.

Inside, Evelyn pushed the door open without knocking.

Nathaniel was reviewing documents, assuming it was Samuel. Without looking up, he said, "Any dinner plans or meetings tonight?"

Silence.

He frowned. "I asked you a question. Are you ignoring me?"

Then he glanced up—and froze.

Evelyn stood there, her cold gaze locked onto him.

He rose immediately, his expression softening. "What are you doing here? Miss me?"

His deep eyes studied her intently as he approached, taking her hand and guiding her to the sofa. His voice was gentle. "Why so quiet? Are you upset? Didn’t you have lunch with Grandmother?"

Evelyn didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she met his gaze squarely.

"Nathaniel, was Sebastian’s kidnapping really just his doing?"

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed slightly. He remained silent for two beats before responding, "What exactly are you asking?"

###Chapter 341 

"You still haven't answered my question!" Her voice was icy, her expression unreadable.

Nathaniel's hesitation was palpable. She could see the war raging behind his dark eyes.

Evelyn tilted her head, lips curling into a bitter smile. "Your silence speaks volumes. So, what does it mean?"

"Nathaniel, I—"

"You knew about your connection to Isabella Davis all along, didn’t you? And yet, you hid it from me." Her accusation hung heavy in the air.

His jaw tightened, the conflict in his gaze deepening. But he said nothing.

That silence shattered something inside her. A cold laugh escaped her lips. "I almost wish you’d lie to me. Tell me I’m imagining things. That none of this is true. I’d believe you if you just said it."

But he didn’t.

That was what hurt the most.

Her chest burned with betrayal. She inhaled sharply, her face drained of color. "If you care for her so much, why not divorce me and marry her? I’m sure she’s waiting with open arms."

"It’s not what you think." His voice was rough, strained. There were things he couldn’t explain—not yet.

Evelyn scoffed. "Then enlighten me. What is the truth?"

Silence.

Another laugh, this one laced with scorn. "You love her but won’t admit it. How pathetic. Playing with my feelings, making a fool of me—again and again. It’s disgusting." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "If it’s the baby keeping you from leaving, just say the word. I’ll get rid of it. No need to torture yourself—or her."

"Evelyn!" His voice cracked like thunder, his expression turning deadly.

"Don’t joke about this."

She met his gaze, unflinching. "Do I look like I’m joking? But jokes can become reality."

His entire body tensed, the air between them turning frigid. "Are you seriously using our child as leverage?"

"Leverage?" She let out a hollow laugh. "If I had any power over you, would you have let my kidnapper walk free? Face it—Isabella matters more to you than our child ever will."

Her voice trembled with resolve. "I can’t do this anymore. I refuse to share my husband—my child’s father—with another woman. So here’s your choice: let me go, or I’ll end this pregnancy myself."

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened, fury rolling off him in waves. "So if I refuse to divorce you, you’ll kill our baby?"

Her smile was razor-thin. "You let a child-endangering monster roam free. What does that say about how much this baby means to you?"

"I told you—it’s not what you think. There are things I can’t explain yet. But one thing’s certain—I will never marry her."

The words did nothing to soothe the storm between them.

###Chapter 342

His face was like ice, eyes burning with barely contained fury. Yet his words were measured, as if fighting to keep his temper in check.

"This is your mess, not mine. All I know is you picked Isabella," Evelyn said coolly.

"Evelyn, are you seriously using a child as leverage against me?"

She didn’t answer. Silence was confirmation enough.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, then abruptly stood and strode to his desk. His voice was frigid. "That child is inside you. I can’t force you to do anything. But Evelyn—your grandmother is under my care now. Think carefully before you act. Or you’ll regret it."

Evelyn stiffened, but her expression didn’t waver. A mocking smile curled her lips. "Go ahead, Nathaniel. Do your worst."

They parted in bitter silence.

The moment Evelyn left, Nathaniel swept everything off his desk in one violent motion. His tie was yanked loose, frustration boiling over.

Outside, Samuel flinched at the crash. The secretaries exchanged nervous glances. "Mr. Yates… should we check on him?"

Samuel hesitated, then knocked and entered.

The office was a disaster. He barely dared to breathe, instantly regretting his decision.

Cautiously, he began gathering scattered papers. "Mr. Martin… what happened with Mrs. Martin?"

Nathaniel’s glare could freeze fire. "Find out. Now. Who she met. Where she went today."

Samuel nodded and rushed to investigate.

The report came swiftly. "Mrs. Martin visited Mrs. Beatrice at the hospital at noon. As for other encounters… we’re still verifying."

"Check if Isabella was there."

"Right away."

Samuel contacted Isabella’s mother. The answer came too quickly.

When he relayed the truth, Nathaniel’s expression darkened like a winter storm.

A cruel smirk twisted his lips. "Isabella’s been too quiet since signing with Martin Group. Let’s give the media something to talk about—her connection to Donovan Sinclair. Otherwise, what’s the point of keeping her?"

Samuel understood instantly. The order was executed before sunset.

News of Isabella’s ties to Donovan exploded across headlines. The scandal was irresistible—Donovan, the infamous playboy, entangled with the "pure-hearted" Isabella, especially after her history with Nathaniel.

The public devoured the narrative: Had she traded love for luxury?

Fans bombarded her social media, demanding denials.

But Isabella stayed silent. Crossing Donovan wasn’t an option.

The story trended for days.

Meanwhile, Evelyn moved into Beatrice’s apartment, the rift between her and Nathaniel widening.

They ignored each other. Evelyn buried herself in work or hospital visits.

Then, fate intervened. Beatrice’s condition suddenly improved.

###Chapter 343

Dr. Harrison's call came unexpectedly. He informed Evelyn they'd located a perfect donor heart for Beatrice's transplant. Since Evelyn had delegated all search efforts to him, she didn't question the source. Pure relief flooded her veins.

They scheduled the procedure immediately. At Beatrice's age, recovery time was crucial. The sooner they operated, the better her chances.

Evelyn rushed back to the hospital room, breathless with joy. "Grandma, it's happening! The perfect match came faster than we hoped." She squeezed Beatrice's frail hand. "This is just the first of many good things coming our way."

Beatrice's eyes crinkled with warmth. "Let the doctors handle the details, darling. You need rest too." Her gaze turned knowing. "Where's Nathaniel these days? I haven't seen him visit."

"Boardroom battles." Evelyn forced a smile. "You could always summon him yourself."

"Never mind." Beatrice patted her cheek. "But do look after that husband of yours."

Evelyn nodded mechanically. She wouldn't burden Beatrice with the truth - how Nathaniel's deception made her feel like Isabella's laughingstock. The memory tightened her throat.

She pushed the thoughts away. Only Beatrice's surgery mattered now.

A nurse entered with medication, beaming. "Ms. Mitchell, congratulations on the donor match!"

"Thank you for everything." Evelyn meant it. The staff adored Beatrice, often remarking how kindness attracted good fortune. Unlike other wealthy families, the Mitchells treated them as equals.

Word spread through the hospital corridors.

It reached Winifred Davis during Isabella's obligatory visit. "That Martin woman got her heart," Winifred mused aloud. "When will we find yours?"

Isabella froze. "Who told you that?"

"Everyone's talking about it. Apparently, good karma exists."

Isabella stormed out without another word, leaving Winifred sighing at Simon. "Will our daughter ever marry into the Martins? We sold our home for this."

Simon rubbed his temples. "Focus on your health first."

Isabella went straight to Nathaniel's office.

"Did you give my mother's heart to Beatrice?" she demanded.

Nathaniel's expression turned glacial. He'd grown colder since her lies to Evelyn. "Is that why you're here? To accuse me?"

Isabella faltered. "Nathaniel, I just—"

###Chapter 344 

"If you've got solid proof, leak it to the press. Otherwise, keep your mouth shut. As for your mother's heart transplant, you've been handling it yourself. The matching team will contact you directly. Do I look like I have time to micromanage this?"

Nathaniel's icy tone made Isabella flinch. Her lips pressed into a thin line, eyes brimming with wounded pride. "Nathaniel, I wasn't accusing you. I'm just worried... Can you at least ensure Dr. Harrison operates on my mother?"

"Schedule it with him yourself. The Martin Group has its hands full right now."

His chair scraped back as he stood, towering over her. "I've kept my end of our deal, Isabella. But you? You've given me nothing but empty words. How is that fair?"

"Nathaniel, I—"

"I'm trying to remember, I swear!" Her voice cracked. "Every therapy session terrifies me. When I close my eyes, all I see are hands around my throat. It's paralyzing." Tears streaked her cheeks, the perfect picture of fragility.

Nathaniel didn't blink. His expression remained carved from stone.

Samuel cleared his throat by the door. "Sir, the board is waiting."

"Right." Nathaniel adjusted his cufflinks, his gaze pinning Isabella like a specimen. "Remember what I told you. My silence doesn't mean ignorance." The unspoken threat lingered as he strode out, leaving her trembling.

With Nathaniel refusing to intervene, Isabella marched into Dr. Harrison's office alone.

Winifred's pre-op tests revealed alarming results. The previous emergency had weakened her condition. "Transplant postponed until further notice," the doctor declared.

Isabella's nails bit into her palms. This confirmed it—Nathaniel had stolen Beatrice's match. He and Dr. Harrison were conspiring against her.

Rage propelled her through hospital corridors until she burst into Beatrice's private suite.

An elderly woman sat chatting with a younger brunette—Rosalind, the new cook. Both startled at the intrusion.

"Can we help you?" Rosalind stepped forward, blocking the bed.

Ignoring her, Isabella zeroed in on Beatrice. "You." Her voice dripped venom. "How dare you take what belongs to my mother? That heart was ours first!"

Beatrice's gentle face clouded with confusion. "Young lady, I think you're mistaken—"

"Save your lies!" Isabella shoved past Rosalind. "You're practically a corpse already! Why cling to life by stealing from others?"

Rosalind grabbed her arm. "You need to leave. Now."

But Isabella wrenched free, wild-eyed. "I won't let you get away with this!"

Beatrice's frail hands clutched the sheets. "What exactly are you accusing me of?"

The monitor's steady beep underscored the silence.

###Chapter 345 

Evelyn's gaze burned with fury as she locked eyes with Beatrice.

"Admit it! Your precious granddaughter is using her husband Nathaniel's influence to control the hospital. Without your interference, my mother would've had her surgery by now. You're a disgrace who'll pay for this!"

"Isabella Thompson! That's enough!" Nathaniel's voice cut through the air as he entered the ward.

His expression was unreadable as he pointed to the door. "Get out before I have security remove you."

"Afraid the truth will come out?" Isabella scoffed. "If Evelyn's so innocent, why can't she face the accusations?"

She wasn't leaving. Not until she'd made her point. This was all Evelyn's fault, and she'd make sure everyone knew it.

Nathaniel's voice turned glacial. "Show proof or leave. I won't warn you again."

Isabella smirked and jabbed a finger at Beatrice. "Using a sick old woman as leverage? How low will you stoop for-"

The sharp crack of Nathaniel's palm meeting her cheek silenced her.

Isabella staggered back, shock flashing across her face. This marked the third time he'd struck her.

The fire in his eyes made her blood run cold.

"Next time I won't be so gentle," Nathaniel warned. "One word to the press about you harassing patients, and your precious career is finished. Test me."

Her cheek throbbed as she clenched her jaw. After a tense moment, she stormed out without another word.

But this wasn't over. She'd make Evelyn regret everything.

Once Isabella left, the room fell silent. Nathaniel took a steadying breath before turning back to Beatrice.

Rosalind discreetly exited.

Nathaniel forced a smile as he approached the bed. "Don't listen to her nonsense. The donor came through my connections, not hers."

Beatrice nodded weakly.

Still uneasy, Nathaniel instructed Rosalind to bar Isabella from entering. He couldn't risk her upsetting Beatrice again.

But vigilance had its limits.

That evening, while Rosalind escorted Beatrice through the gardens, Isabella reappeared.

"You should be ashamed!" she hissed. "Stealing what belongs to my family. How can you live with yourself?"

Rosalind tried to intervene, but the public humiliation cut deep. Beatrice had never been called such things in her long life.

The gathering crowd's whispers burned worse than any insult.

Isabella, disguised behind sunglasses, continued her tirade. Though unrecognizable, her words left Beatrice trembling with shame.

The scandalous rumors began spreading before they'd even left the courtyard.

###Chapter 346

Isabella's constant interference had pushed Beatrice to refuse the surgery. "Let her mother get tested first," the elderly woman insisted stubbornly. "I won't have peace of mind otherwise. At my age, how much longer do I really have? But I won't be the reason for anyone's discomfort."

No amount of pleading could change Beatrice's mind.

Evelyn blamed everything on Isabella. Her voice turned icy as she warned over the phone, "Isabella Davis, you'd better hope nothing happens to my grandmother. If she suffers because of you, I swear I'll make you regret it. I'll destroy you, even if it costs me everything."

Isabella immediately played innocent. "Why is this my fault? I never said anything to your grandmother. There were dozens of people in that room - why are you singling me out?"

"I don't care about your excuses. To me, you're responsible. If anything happens to Beatrice, you'll pay dearly." Evelyn's eyes darkened with barely contained fury.

She knew her threats meant nothing to Isabella - the woman had clearly lost all reason.

So Evelyn took more decisive action. She texted Nathaniel directly, asking him to inform Samuel about Isabella's hospital visit and how she'd upset Beatrice. Isabella might not fear Evelyn, but she certainly cared about Nathaniel's opinion.

Samuel relayed the message faithfully, prompting Nathaniel to immediately call Isabella.

Though Nathaniel had once used Beatrice to threaten Evelyn, he couldn't tolerate Isabella actually harassing the elderly woman. His voice turned cold as he demanded, "Isabella, didn't you hear what I told you before?"

"I don't understand what you mean, Nathaniel."

"I warned you not to bother Evelyn - especially not her grandmother. Are you really this desperate that you'd target an innocent old woman?" His words cut like ice.

Isabella immediately turned defensive. "Did Evelyn say something to you? I haven't done anything wrong! Yes, I had suspicions at first, but Dr. Theodore explained..."
###Chapter 347 

"Isabella, are you threatening me?"

"Yes, I am."

Isabella narrowed her eyes. Her delicate features should have radiated warmth, but now they carried a sharp edge, unsettling to behold.

The voice on the other end remained calm, almost soothing. "I've told you before—our business has nothing to do with Evelyn. Dragging innocent people into this won’t secure your place in Nathaniel’s heart. It’ll only push him further away."

"Enough. I don’t need your lectures. Just tell me when Evelyn and Nathaniel will finally break. If I don’t become Mrs. Martin, do you really think we’ll get what we want?"

"Isabella, we agreed never to discuss the Martin Group over the phone. Do you want everything ruined before it’s even begun?"

His warning was low, deliberate.

She muttered an agreement, though she thought he was being paranoid. Her phone never left her side.

Still, he pressed on. "This isn’t a joke, Isabella. Remember who you’re dealing with—especially Nathaniel. He’s ten steps ahead of you. If you try to outmaneuver him, you’ll lose. So be careful."

"Fine. I understand."

Impatience crept into her tone.

"When are you making your move?"

"Soon."

No specifics. She didn’t push. Hanging up, she turned her attention back to her concert preparations.

Signing with the Martin Group had doubled her workload, but every task was a stepping stone to her future. She had to endure.

Coming back after a year was exhausting. She’d hoped to return as Nathaniel’s wife, but that dream remained just out of reach. She couldn’t rely on that fantasy anymore—she needed another way.

The thought of Evelyn’s smooth-sailing life made her blood boil. She wouldn’t let her win.

Beatrice’s surgery had been postponed again. Evelyn had tried to convince her, but failed. The stress had taken its toll—she’d lost weight, her exhaustion visible.

Returning to her apartment after work, she stepped into the elevator—only to find Nathaniel already inside.

Their eyes met. Neither spoke.

The confined space amplified every breath, every unspoken word between them.

Strangers.

The frustration was unbearable. Because of Isabella, she’d resolved to ignore him. Just the thought of that woman made her fists clench.

The doors opened. She turned left. He went right.

At Beatrice’s door, she fumbled for her keys. Just as she stepped inside, strong arms pulled her back. Warm lips crashed against hers.

Evelyn’s eyes flew open. His face was inches from hers, his brows slightly furrowed—displeased.

She didn’t resist, afraid of hurting the baby. So she waited, letting him kiss her until he finally loosened his grip.

He rested his forehead against hers, unmoving. His gaze burned into her, voice rough. "You’re really going to pretend you didn’t see me?"

His scent surrounded her, stirring something deep inside—anger, longing, confusion.

She lowered her lashes, silent.

His question hung between them, unanswered.
###Chapter 348 

Nathaniel's lips curled into a cold smirk. "So you genuinely don't miss me? You refuse to reconcile?"

Evelyn glared at him, her brows knitting together. "Who forced you to threaten me? You even dragged Beatrice into this. Do you have any idea how much she means to me?"

"And you?" His voice dropped dangerously. "You're using our unborn child as leverage. Does this baby hold no value to you?"

"That's different—"

"I don't care about your reasons. Never threaten me like that again. Understood?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, refusing to answer. Nathaniel tilted her chin up with his fingers, his touch deceptively gentle. "Answer me, sweetheart."

Her voice softened, though her words remained sharp. "So now I'm the villain, and you're blameless?"

Confusion flickered in his eyes.

Hadn’t this been about her actions? How had the tables turned so quickly?

Before he could respond, Evelyn struck again. "Tomorrow, I’m telling Beatrice everything. She trusts you completely, yet you exploited her trust to manipulate me. Nathaniel, who’s truly heartless here—you or me?"

He recognized the trap instantly.

Leaning closer, he murmured, "Fine. I’ll apologize to her myself tomorrow. I’ll confess everything—including your little plan to terminate the pregnancy. Let her decide who’s at fault."

Evelyn’s eyes flashed. "So this isn’t reconciliation. It’s another warning."

Nathaniel chuckled darkly.

Cupping her face, he whispered, "You talk too much. I prefer you silent."

Then his mouth captured hers in a searing kiss.

By the time he pulled away, Evelyn was breathless, her legs unsteady. She clung to him for support.

Seizing the moment, Nathaniel swept her into his arms and carried her toward the bedroom.

Just like that, their feud dissolved into the night.

The next morning, Nathaniel drove Evelyn to the hospital for breakfast with Beatrice. The older woman blinked in surprise at their early arrival.

"Since when do young people wake up this early?" Beatrice teased.

"Maybe I’m not as young as you think," Evelyn quipped.

Nathaniel smiled smoothly. "She insisted we come. And I haven’t visited in days—my apologies. I hope you’ll forgive me."

Beatrice’s eyes twinkled. "Did Evelyn force you to say that?"

Nathaniel stayed silent, letting the implication hang.

Evelyn scowled. "Grandma, don’t believe him. I didn’t force anything."

She shot Nathaniel a glare. "Why stay quiet? Trying to make me look bad?"

Nathaniel merely grinned, pinching her cheek affectionately. The tenderness in his gaze was unmistakable.

Watching their exchange, Beatrice couldn’t suppress a delighted smile.

The trio chatted animatedly, filling the hospital room with warmth.

After breakfast, Nathaniel dropped Evelyn at her office. With the preliminary rounds approaching, her workload had doubled.

But the moment she stepped inside, she froze.

Danielle sat directly in front of the entrance, her chair blocking the way.

Evelyn’s polite mask slipped. "This isn’t a lounge. Move your chair elsewhere."

###Chapter 349

Evelyn stood motionless, her silence deafening.

Danielle's face darkened, her voice sharpening. "Evelyn, are you even listening?"

"Who do you think you are to order me around?" Danielle scoffed, flipping her hair dismissively. She shoved her earbuds in, flashing Evelyn a mocking smirk.

Frustration coiled in Evelyn's chest. She signaled Gabrielle, who rushed over with an exasperated sigh.
"Ms. Mitchell, Ms. Parker barged in demanding to see Mr. Wilson. When we told her he wasn’t here, she started screaming threats—said she’d have us all fired."

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. "Get two security guys," she murmured. "Escort her out."

The men didn’t hesitate. They hoisted Danielle—chair and all—straight through the lobby doors.

Danielle exploded. She swung her purse like a weapon, then jabbed a finger at Evelyn. "This is my brother’s company! You’re the outsider here. Disgusting, clinging to him when you’re married!"

Evelyn’s gaze turned glacial. "For Gregory’s sake, I’m tolerating this. But keep spewing lies, and I’ll call the police. Again."

Danielle flinched. The last encounter still stung—especially how Evelyn had turned the tables.

Her glare burned. "Nathaniel won’t protect you forever. You’re unlovable, Evelyn. A placeholder."

"I’ve done nothing to you. Why this obsession?"

"Because you won’t let Gregory go!"

Danielle was convinced Gregory only entertained Evelyn out of pity.

Gabrielle snapped. "Mr. Wilson has a girlfriend. Remember the café? This isn’t about Ms. Mitchell. And this company? It’s hers too."

Danielle froze. Then her breathing turned ragged.

"Liar!" she shrieked. "He’d never—he can’t—" The image of Gregory smiling at another woman shattered her.

He belonged to her. Only her.

Evelyn shot Gabrielle a warning look. No more fuel for this fire. She dialed Gregory.

No answer.

Her fingers clenched the phone. She assigned a staffer to babysit Danielle—not out of concern, but damage control. For Gregory’s sake.

Back at her desk, Evelyn buried herself in blueprints. The competition loomed. Every second counted.

By lunch, Gregory finally called.

"Sorry," he said, voice strained. "Just saw your missed call."

###Chapter 350

"It's fine. I'm not busy. Just wanted to discuss Danielle with you." Evelyn glanced at her watch. "Where are you? She's probably searching for you at the office right now."

"Handling some errands. I'll be there in thirty." Gregory's voice crackled through the car speakers. Danielle always gave him a migraine. "Did she disturb you? I suggested she visit a friend last night, but she assumed it was a therapist. Now she's upset."

"She didn't bother me. But you need to resolve this. The entire office shouldn't suffer because of her." Evelyn tapped her pen against the desk. "Her obsession with you is unhealthy. It's affecting everyone."

"I know."

"We'll talk more at the office."

Hanging up, Evelyn turned to Gabrielle. "Is she still here?"

"Waiting in Mr. Wilson's office."

"Good. Tell everyone to steer clear of her. No unnecessary interactions." Evelyn massaged her temples.

As she reached for her phone to order lunch, it buzzed.

Victoria's name flashed on the screen. Evelyn hesitated before answering. "Hello?"

"Evelyn, darling. Have you eaten?" Victoria's tone was honeyed.

"Not yet. I was just about to order." Evelyn straightened in her chair. "What about you?"

"Perfect timing. Come downstairs. I'm waiting outside your building." Victoria's laugh tinkled. "Let's have lunch together. It's been too long."

"Of course. I'll be right down."

Evelyn welcomed the distraction. Unlike other society matrons, Victoria treated her like an equal. Their conversations flowed effortlessly.

They chose an upscale bistro nearby. Over seared scallops, Victoria's demeanor shifted.

"Evelyn," she began carefully, "how are things with Nathaniel lately?"

"Fine." Evelyn sipped her sparkling water. "Why?"

"Has he mentioned anything to you?"

Evelyn shook her head, perplexed. "No."

Victoria's smile didn't reach her eyes. "After this, I want to show you something."

A chill crept down Evelyn's spine. Victoria's sudden coldness clearly concerned Nathaniel. The mystery only deepened Evelyn's curiosity.

Their relationship had been improving lately. While Victoria excused herself, Evelyn quickly texted Nathaniel: [Where are you?]

His reply came seconds later: [Client meeting. Miss me already?]

Evelyn rolled her eyes and flipped her phone face down.

"Something amusing?" Victoria reappeared, smoothing her silk blouse.

"Just spam messages."

Lately, Nathaniel had been testing boundaries with his flirtatious texts. Each one made her pulse stutter dangerously. She couldn't afford to fall for him again—not when she knew how badly it would end.

After lunch, Victoria led her through winding alleys to a hidden café.

Evelyn hesitated at the unmarked door. "Where exactly are we going?"

###Chapter 351 

Victoria's face was unreadable, but her tone remained warm. "Let's go out today. You can't just bury yourself in work forever. As a Martin, you'll never lack for money even if you never lift a finger again. I know you love your career, darling, but even the most driven people need breaks."

Evelyn couldn't help but chuckle at that.

She linked arms with Victoria, murmuring, "Sometimes I think Nathaniel was adopted and I'm your real daughter."

"Aren't you?" Victoria countered with a smile.

The tension melted away as they stepped into the chic café. The hostess immediately recognized Victoria. "Mrs. Martin! Your usual booth?"

"Actually, could we take the one near the private room? We'd like some privacy." Victoria gestured discreetly. "Just some fruit, my usual coffee, and sparkling water for Evelyn."

As they settled into the plush velvet seats separated by ornate screens, Evelyn frowned. This seemed like an odd choice for a casual chat.

Then the voices reached them.

A woman's confident tone carried through the divider. "Four years, Nathaniel, and you're still as emotionally constipated as ever. Some things never change."

Nathaniel's measured response followed. "Professional distance serves us both well, Cassandra. You're running Montgomery Group now. Sentiment has no place in business."

"Spoken like a true Martin. Fine, have it your way. But outside these meetings... we were good friends once. Partners, even. Remember our startup days? No one's beaten our record yet."

Evelyn's grip tightened on her water glass as she pieced together their history. Cassandra Montgomery - Nathaniel's college business partner, now CEO of a rival firm. Their last collaboration was during his Salzburg trip. This Marseille meeting was clearly planned.

She turned to Victoria with dawning understanding. "You brought me here for this."

Victoria squeezed her hand. "I'm team Evelyn, always. The Montgomerys have worked with us for decades, but that woman knows you're his wife. She's testing boundaries." Her gaze turned steely. "And you should know when to guard what's yours."

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips despite the warmth flooding her chest. This woman who owed her no blood ties had chosen her over her own son.

"Thank you," Evelyn whispered. Then practicality kicked in. "But we shouldn't be eavesdropping. If this gets out—"

"Relax," Victoria cut in smoothly. "The screens are soundproofed from their side. This booth was designed for private conversations." She arched a brow. "Now listen closely."

The tension in Evelyn's shoulders didn't ease as Cassandra's laugh tinkled through the divider. "Remember that night after finals? When we—"

Nathaniel's chair scraped abruptly. "That was a lifetime ago. I have a wife now."

Evelyn's breath caught. Victoria's knowing smile said everything.

###Chapter 352 

"Absolutely not. Since we're here together, even as business partners, he should have included you. You're his wife—a Martin now," Victoria insisted.

Evelyn felt a warmth spread through her chest at her mother-in-law's words. She smiled, gratitude shining in her eyes.

But she still couldn't bring herself to believe Nathaniel had feelings for Cassandra. His heart belonged to someone else.

The thought weighed on her. She bit her lower lip lightly, murmuring, "Victoria, maybe we're misjudging him. He loves Isabella. He wouldn't just..."

Victoria fell silent.

As a mother, she knew the history between Nathaniel and Isabella. But she refused to accept that her son would chain himself to a woman who no longer had a future.

She squeezed Evelyn's hand firmly. "Listen to me. Nathaniel and Isabella ended things before your marriage. The only reason he still cares for her is out of guilt—because of what happened. But he doesn't love her. I know my son. That kind of love is gone."

Her certainty left Evelyn speechless. She didn’t want to argue, nor did she want Victoria confronting Nathaniel over this.

A brief silence settled between them—until Cassandra’s sharp voice cut through from the screen.

"Nathaniel, I never expected you to actually marry her. A complete stranger, no less. And yet here you are, a year later. Tell me—do you love her?"

Evelyn’s pulse jumped. Victoria instinctively glanced at her.

Meeting her gaze, Evelyn forced a smile. It only made Victoria’s heart ache more.

Before Nathaniel could respond, Victoria stood abruptly. "I thought I recognized that voice. Nathaniel, it really is you."

Both Nathaniel and Cassandra stiffened in surprise.

Recovering first, Nathaniel frowned slightly. "Mother? What are you doing here?"

"Mrs. Martin," Cassandra greeted smoothly, rising with practiced grace. "You used to bake for me during university. I haven’t forgotten."

Victoria’s expression cooled. Manners kept her from outright dismissal, but her tone was distant. "That was a long time ago. No need to dwell on it."

She turned back to Nathaniel, her face carefully blank. "Evelyn and I were out shopping. We happened to be nearby, so I brought her here."

"Is Evelyn here?" Nathaniel asked, his voice softening.

Then he was moving, stepping around the screen until he spotted her at the table. Their eyes locked—hers carefully neutral, his searching.

With Victoria’s presence revealed, the four of them ended up sharing the table.

Evelyn and Nathaniel sat side by side, while Victoria and Cassandra faced them.

Cassandra was striking—effortlessly elegant in minimalist designer wear, her long hair cascading over one shoulder. Unlike Isabella’s delicate fragility, she carried herself with a careless confidence.

When Evelyn met her gaze, Cassandra didn’t look away. She studied her openly, almost challengingly.

Under the table, Nathaniel’s fingers curled around Evelyn’s. "Where did you and Mother go today?" he asked, as if Cassandra weren’t even there.

Evelyn kept her expression composed.

But with both women watching, she answered evenly, "Just wandering. What about you?"

She glanced at him pointedly. She had texted him the same question earlier—during dinner.

###Chapter 353

He claimed it was a business meeting with a client.

Evelyn suppressed a scoff.

Nathaniel caught her displeasure and tightened his grip on her hand subtly. His expression silently promised an explanation later.

Cassandra smiled. "Nathaniel, I never took you for the henpecked type. I'll think twice before inviting you out again."

Nathaniel offered a faint smile but remained silent.

Cassandra continued, "Ms. Mitchell, don’t misunderstand. Nathaniel and I are strictly business partners. The recent architectural competition marked our first collaboration since I took over Montgomery Group, so frequent discussions were necessary. If you’re concerned, we can exchange numbers. I’ll video call you during our meetings to avoid any misunderstandings."

Her tone was diplomatic, devoid of sarcasm, almost painfully sincere.

Yet every word grated on Evelyn’s nerves.

She kept her composure, glancing at Nathaniel before settling her gaze on Cassandra.

"Ms. Montgomery, while I appreciate the offer, I’m not that controlling. It’s Nathaniel who insists on sharing his schedule. I’ve told him it’s unnecessary, but he won’t listen." She tilted her head. "Since you know him well, maybe you could talk some sense into him?"

Cassandra blinked, caught off guard. She looked at Nathaniel, expecting irritation—only to find him amused, his thumb tracing circles on Evelyn’s palm beneath the table. A silent retaliation for Cassandra’s meddling.

Victoria chuckled. "Cassandra, you’d be shocked. This man turns into a lovesick puppy around Evelyn. Shows up at her office unannounced, texts constantly—even I, his own mother, find it hard to believe."

Cassandra’s smile faltered. Nathaniel’s lack of denial made her reassess everything.

The silence stretched. Evelyn had no desire to linger. Cassandra was Montgomery Group’s CEO and Nathaniel’s college friend—burning bridges wasn’t an option.

"We should go," Evelyn said smoothly. "Ms. Montgomery, you’re welcome to join us for dinner at our place while you’re in Marseille."

Cassandra recovered quickly. "That’s very kind of you, Ms. Mitchell."

"Just being hospitable. You’re Nathaniel’s friend and a valued partner."

With that, Evelyn and Victoria left.

At the door, Victoria told the waiter, "Charge it to Nathaniel’s account."

In the car, Victoria studied Evelyn’s profile. "You’re upset."

Evelyn exhaled. "Not about them meeting. They’re colleagues. Friends. It’s fine."

What stung was Nathaniel’s secrecy.

A simple "Having coffee with Cassandra from college" would’ve sufficed. Transparency mattered more than the meeting itself.

Victoria dropped her off at work. Before Evelyn stepped out, Victoria hesitated. "Are you sure you’re okay?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Tell Edward I’ll visit for dinner soon."

###Chapter 354

Evelyn swiftly changed the subject, and Victoria nodded in agreement, ending the discussion.

Taking the elevator back to her office, Evelyn heard the shrill voice of a woman demanding answers.

"Gregory, tell me right now! Who was that woman in your car? What's going on between you two? Are you cheating on me?"

Evelyn stepped closer and saw Gregory gripping Danielle's wrist, trying to pull her away, but Danielle clung stubbornly to the doorframe.

Gregory's expression darkened. "Enough," he said through gritted teeth. "I told you, she's just a friend. If you keep this up, I'm sending you back to Dresden."

Danielle only grew more hysterical.

Her eyes glazed over as she hissed, "You want me gone so you can be with her, is that it? You think I won't find out who she is?" She yanked out her phone and shoved photos in the employees' faces. "Look! Your boss enjoys everything my family has given him while sneaking around with another woman. Tell me—doesn't that make him a hypocrite?"

Gregory's patience snapped.

The usually composed man now radiated fury. When Danielle tried to break free and show the photos to everyone, Gregory released her abruptly. As she stumbled toward the workstations, his hand shot out, gripping her arm before delivering a sharp slap across her cheek.

"Danielle," he growled. "This is an office. Take your tantrum somewhere else before you humiliate yourself further."

Danielle froze.

Gregory had never laid a hand on her before. Even at her worst, he'd only ever raised his voice.

This was the first time.

Her voice trembled. "You hit me?"

Gregory said nothing, his gaze cold.

"You actually hit me," she whispered. "Who do you think you are?"

Then she lunged at him. Gregory caught her wrists effortlessly and dragged her toward the exit.

That was when he noticed Evelyn standing by the door, watching. His expression tightened briefly before he hauled Danielle out.

Their argument echoed through the workspace, drawing stares. Evelyn quickly instructed Gabrielle to ensure no one recorded the scene, then murmured to Gregory as he passed, "Talk it out. Don't do something you'll regret."

She couldn't condone a man striking a woman, no matter how infuriating Danielle was.

Once they were gone, Evelyn retreated to her office.

She had barely settled when Gabrielle rushed in, eyes wide with gossip.

"Ms. Mitchell," she whispered. "I saw the photos Ms. Parker took. You'll never guess who that woman with Mr. Wilson is—"

###Chapter 355

Evelyn wasn't particularly curious. Gregory was a grown man, after all. From her perspective, she genuinely hoped he would find someone who suited him—someone he truly loved.

But Gabrielle's cautious expression, as if she'd stumbled upon some earth-shattering secret, piqued Evelyn's interest. She tilted her head. "Who is it? Who's got you acting like this?"

Gabrielle hesitated, lowering her voice. "The woman Mr. Wilson is seeing… she's the one I met at the café."

"You saw her?"

"Yes. Not her face, though. She looked elegant—well-dressed, great figure. Mr. Wilson has good taste, so she must be stunning."

Evelyn lost interest. Without knowing the woman’s identity, speculation was pointless.

Still, she pressed, "How do you know it’s the same person from Danielle’s photo?"

"Because Danielle only captured her back."

Evelyn frowned but didn’t push further.

If it was just a photo of the woman’s back, Gregory wouldn’t have reacted so strongly.

His anger suggested he didn’t want anyone in the company seeing that picture. He’s protecting her. The realization brought Evelyn an odd sense of relief.

If Gregory had someone to shield, then he’d only ever see Evelyn as a friend.

And Nathaniel wouldn’t misunderstand their relationship anymore.

At the thought of Nathaniel, her expression darkened.

Not long after Evelyn and Victoria left, Nathaniel and Cassandra returned to the office.

Cassandra hesitated before finally speaking. "Nathaniel… did you marry Evelyn because of your grandfather?"

Nathaniel glanced at her. "Yes."

"You two have nothing in common, do you?"

"It doesn’t matter."

His tone was calm, detached.

Cassandra narrowed her eyes. "Honestly, I never expected you to settle for an arranged marriage—let alone have a child with her."

"Evelyn is exceptional. There’s nothing strange about it."

During their marriage, Evelyn had been the perfect wife—gentle, attentive, effortlessly managing everything at home. She knew his habits, his preferences. He’d grown accustomed to that life.

But since she moved out, she’d shed that persona entirely.

She was vibrant now. Alive.

And Nathaniel found himself inexplicably drawn to her.

When he realized how completely she captivated him, it didn’t surprise him. She was extraordinary.

Her beauty alone could drive men to obsession.

A faint smile touched his lips as he answered Cassandra.

She stared at him, stunned.

After a beat, she asked, "Nathaniel… are you really over Isabella? I remember how much you loved her. Even though you were in different worlds, you never let her suffer. A year ago, she nearly died because of you—ended up in a vegetative state. That scandal shook Marseille. Can you truly move on?"

Nathaniel’s expression darkened—whether at the mention of Isabella or Cassandra’s words, it was unclear.

###Chapter 356

His expression was unreadable, eyes giving nothing away.

Nathaniel narrowed his gaze. "Cassandra, do you all believe I'm in love with Isabella?"

Who exactly was included in that "you all"? Only Nathaniel could say for certain.

Cassandra hesitated before answering, "Isn't that obvious?"

A frown creased his brow. "Misconceptions can be dangerous."

"Nathaniel, I don’t understand. Are you saying—?"

"Not everything you witness is the truth."

Silence settled between them.

Normally sharp, Cassandra found herself at a loss.

She couldn’t accept it.

Does he really not love Isabella?

Then why?

From what she knew, Isabella was thriving under Martin Entertainment. Wasn’t Nathaniel supporting her career?

Yet his detached demeanor suggested otherwise.

Pressing her lips together, Cassandra fell deep into thought.

Back at Martin Group headquarters, Nathaniel instructed Samuel to escort Cassandra to the competition site while he called Evelyn.

"What are you doing?" he asked.

"Working."

Her reply was clipped.

His voice softened. "Are you upset with me?"

"Why would I be?"

"Because I wasn’t entirely honest. Does that bother you?"

"You’re imagining things."

Evelyn refused to admit the truth, her tone icy.

After a pause, Nathaniel explained, "I didn’t mean to withhold anything. Cassandra’s trip to Marseille was business-related. That’s why I answered the way I did."

"I see. Anything else? I’m swamped with preparations for the competition."

Nathaniel’s voice dropped lower. "Evelyn, are you truly buried in designs, or are you avoiding me?"

"I’m not."

"Not what?"

"Nathaniel, you’re infuriating."

Her irritation flared.

Why does he keep pushing?

Was he wrong? Not exactly. But his lack of transparency grated on her.

She ended the call abruptly and threw herself into her work.

The afternoon passed in a blur of sketches and discussions with Gabrielle and the team. By the time they wrapped up, evening had fallen.

The competition was only two days away.

It had been years since Evelyn last participated in something of this scale. Nerves prickled beneath her focus.

Gathering her materials, she slung her bag over her shoulder and headed out.

The elevator descended smoothly. As she stepped into the parking lot, her gaze snagged on a sleek black Mercedes idling near the curb.

She hesitated, then approached.

The passenger door swung open as she reached it. Nathaniel waited inside.

Evelyn didn’t move. "Why are you here?"

"To drive you home."

"That’s unnecessary. You already arranged a car for me. I can manage."

The faint scent of tobacco lingered in the air. Nathaniel studied her, his gaze unwavering.

"I insist."

###Chapter 357

Evelyn froze, caught completely off guard.

Nathaniel's intense gaze never wavered as he murmured, "Get in the car. We shouldn't linger here." Evelyn bit her lip. Was he actually worried about that?

Just another excuse.

She finally slid into the passenger seat. Her fingers fumbled with the seatbelt before clicking it shut. The engine purred to life.

Silence stretched between them during the entire drive back to the penthouse.

Neither mentioned Cassandra Montgomery again.

Evelyn mentally shook herself. This was trivial. Not worth ruining their night over. The competition demanded her full attention anyway - she couldn't afford distractions.

The evening before the event, Nathaniel cornered her in the studio. "You're finishing early tonight." It wasn't a request. "You've been buried in sketches for days. Dinner. Now."

She opened her mouth to protest.

"Consider it a date," he cut in, that familiar stubborn set to his jaw.

Scarlett Restaurant glowed under crystal chandeliers when they arrived.

After dessert, he drove them to the waterfront. Their intertwined fingers swung gently as they walked. The night air smelled of salt and possibility.

Nathaniel suddenly steered her toward a row of trendy bars.

"Let's try this place," he suggested, nodding at a speakeasy-style lounge.

Evelyn hesitated. The bass thumping through the walls made her protective hand drift to her stomach. "Maybe we should just-"

"Five minutes," he bargained, eyes glinting. "Don't you want to see your surprise?"

Before she could respond, his palm covered her eyes. "Trust me," his breath warmed her ear.

They moved through the dim interior. When his hand finally dropped, she blinked at the figure lounging across the velvet booth.

"Charlotte?" Evelyn gasped. "What are you doing here?"

Her best friend smirked, swirling a cocktail. "Your husband flew me first-class to be your competition cheerleader." She fake-gagged. "Disgustingly romantic, really. Should I leave you two alone?"
###Chapter 358 

"It's fine."

"Tsk, so you've got it all now? Career and love life thriving?"

"What about you? Are you doing alright?"

"I'm surviving. Just floating through life alone. Don't waste your pity on me. But if you really want to make it up to me, have that baby and hand it over once it's born. Or better yet, make one just for me, huh?" Charlotte sighed dramatically, putting on her best wounded puppy expression, hoping to tug at Evelyn's heartstrings.

But Evelyn just shot her an icy look. "I'm not wasting any pity on you. Just take care of yourself."

Charlotte clutched her chest in mock offense, grabbing her bag as she stood. "Don't try to stop me. I'm catching a cab back to Dresden tonight."

"Sure. Safe trip."

Evelyn didn't even blink.

With an exaggerated huff, Charlotte marched over and pinched Evelyn's neck. "You heartless witch. Now that you've got a husband, this is how you treat me?"

"Let go. There are cameras everywhere. I might let it slide, but Nathaniel won't. If he shows up, you'll be on that flight to Dresden before midnight."

Charlotte released her with a dramatic "Hmph!" before leaning her head on Evelyn's shoulder. "Good luck tomorrow. Don't choke. I'll be cheering for you."

No matter how much they bickered, nothing could ever change what they were to each other—no outside forces, no petty schemes, nothing.

Nathaniel gave them over an hour to talk before finally calling to say he was waiting outside.

Evelyn and Charlotte walked out hand in hand, sliding into the backseat like Nathaniel was nothing more than their chauffeur.

Charlotte smirked. "Mr. Martin, does it bother you playing driver for us?"

Evelyn rested her head against the window, refusing to engage.

Nathaniel caught her reflection in the rearview mirror and smiled. "Not at all. It's an honor serving two stunning women."

Charlotte's grin widened. Maybe she'd start putting in a good word for him with Evelyn from now on.

Back at the apartment, Charlotte stayed with Beatrice. With an early start for the competition tomorrow, Evelyn headed straight home to shower and—

Yet, sleep wouldn't come.

Evelyn lay staring at the ceiling until Nathaniel covered her eyes with his hand. "What are you thinking about?"

"The competition tomorrow."

"Nervous?"

She shook her head. "No. Just running through the checklist in my head."

"You've done everything you can. Now, sleep. Tomorrow's going to be exhausting."

Evelyn murmured an agreement and turned onto her side.

Nathaniel wrapped an arm around her, pressing a kiss to the back of her neck. "Goodnight."

"Goodnight."

She closed her eyes, willing everything to go smoothly.

The next morning, Evelyn arrived at the company with Charlotte in tow. Since Nathaniel was organizing the event, they had to keep their distance.

Inside, Evelyn called Gabrielle and the team for a final review of the blueprints. Just as they were deep in discussion—

Her phone rang.

Unknown number.

Evelyn stepped toward the floor-to-ceiling windows and answered. "Evelyn Mitchell speaking."

"Evelyn," the voice was soft, distorted by a modulator. "For your own good, walk away from this competition now."

###Chapter 359

Evelyn's eyebrows knitted together. The anonymous call was unexpected, but she kept her composure.

Not wanting to alarm Gabrielle and the others, she responded coolly, "Hiding behind a distorted voice? You've got no right to demand anything from me."

"Consider this friendly advice," the muffled voice countered. "Withdraw now or face humiliation. You won't win today's competition. Mark my words."

The line went dead, leaving Evelyn gripping her phone tighter. The caller's smug certainty sent a chill down her spine.

"Who would do this?" she muttered through clenched teeth. Her mind raced through potential suspects.

She took a steadying breath. "Stay sharp," she reminded herself. "This could be someone's sick game to sabotage..."
###Chapter 360 

Evelyn didn't bother hiding her emotions in front of Charlotte. She exhaled sharply. "I just want everything to go smoothly."

Confidence wasn't arrogance—Evelyn knew her skills, trusted them. Charlotte squeezed her hand. "It will. No doubt about it."

A small smile tugged at Evelyn's lips. "Fingers crossed."

Minutes later, they stepped out of the restroom. Charlotte, buzzing with excitement, wanted to explore the venue.

But as they neared the competitors' area, a group approached. Leading them was a woman in a slinky gown, her face obscured by oversized sunglasses. The click of her stilettos echoed like a warning.

No attempt to move aside.

Evelyn yanked Charlotte to the side just in time. As the woman passed, her painted lips curled in a smirk.

Charlotte huffed. "Who does she think she is? Walking like she owns the place?"

Evelyn chuckled. "Ignore her. Let’s focus on the setup."

But her mind raced. Competitor? Entourage like that—must be someone big.

After touring the venue, the host’s mic check echoed through the space. Time to head back.

The resting room was nearly empty. Only Gabrielle sat there.

Evelyn frowned. "Where is everyone?"

"Bathroom break." Gabrielle gestured to the refreshments. "Staff just dropped these off."

Evelyn barely glanced at them. Her attention locked onto her laptop. The screen was dark—but not powered off.

Her stomach dropped.

"I shut it down earlier," Gabrielle said quickly.

Evelyn’s fingers flew across the keyboard. She pulled up the general design file.

Empty.

The encrypted folder—gone.

Every document. Every backup.

Wiped.

Her voice was ice. "Someone tampered with my files. Our competition entry—it’s all deleted."

Evelyn always worked meticulously—sketches on paper, digital edits, repeat. Paper shredded after. No loose ends.

Her laptop? Fort Knox. Custom security, firewalls, everything.

This wasn’t a glitch.

This was sabotage.

Gabrielle paled. "Ms. Mitchell, I swear—I didn’t—"

"Who came in besides the staff?"

"Just them. No one else."

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. "Keep this quiet. Understood?"

"But the competition starts in thirty minutes! How—"

"My problem," Evelyn cut in. "Yours is to act normal."

Gabrielle nodded, shaky.

Evelyn grabbed her phone. Only one person could help now.

Samuel Yates answered on the first ring.

###Chapter 361

Evelyn told Gabrielle not to inform the other two team members. It wasn't about distrust, but operational security - the fewer people involved, the better.

After briefing Nathaniel, he immediately reached out to the competition organizers. Within minutes, they granted Evelyn access to the security footage. The prime suspect? The fruit delivery person. Further investigation revealed this staff member was an impostor.

The culprit wore a hat and deliberately avoided facing cameras. Identification seemed impossible.

Evelyn accepted her bad luck.

The organizers quickly offered a new green room, but Evelyn chose solitude.

Charlotte offered to stay, but Evelyn declined, needing space to think.

With a concerned glance, Charlotte followed Gabrielle and the others to the new room.

When the team learned what happened, the atmosphere turned heavy.

Gabrielle drowned in guilt. "This is all my fault. I should've been more careful."

Though barely knowing Gabrielle, Charlotte believed her innocence - Evelyn had shared her computer password willingly. "This was planned sabotage," Charlotte reassured. "Even if you'd guarded the computer, they'd have found another way."

"But-"

"Evelyn's suffering most right now. Pregnant, pouring her soul into this competition, putting her career on hold. We need to stay strong and support whatever decision she makes next."

Three solemn nods confirmed their agreement.

As competition time approached,

Evelyn's digital work had vanished.

Though the designs lived in her mind, recreating them seemed impossible.

A calm thought struck her: "Could I present without sketches?"

The door burst open suddenly.

Nathaniel stood there, urgency in his eyes.

Evelyn turned, surprised. "Nathaniel? What are you doing here?"

Her voice was soft, face pale with resignation.

Without words, Nathaniel entered, closed the door, and pulled her into a gentle embrace.

The gesture nearly broke Evelyn. She'd been managing her emotions until then.

His warmth melted her composure.

"I've handled everything," Nathaniel murmured. "Samuel's tracking the impostor and bringing in a tech expert to recover your files. No competition delays. Don't worry."

Evelyn nodded weakly. "Is this... convenient for you?"

Nathaniel chuckled. "You're worrying about my convenience now? Clearly you're not stressed enough."

Evelyn sighed. "What's done is done. I just feel terrible for the team - all their hard work possibly wasted. Losing fair and square is one thing, but sabotage before we even compete? That stings."

###Chapter 362 

Nathaniel was taken aback by Evelyn's calm demeanor. The moment he'd heard about the incident, he'd abandoned his meetings and raced over, expecting to find her distressed. Yet here she stood, composed as ever.

His fingers brushed her cheek lightly. "I had Samuel rearrange the performance order. You'll go on later now. Use this time to prepare properly."

Just then, the computer specialist Samuel had summoned arrived.

After thirty intense minutes, the formatted files were miraculously restored - every design intact. Evelyn's face lit up as she grasped Nathaniel's arm. "Thank you," she whispered.

"Is that all I get?" His eyebrow arched playfully.

"I'll cook you dinner after this is over? As proper thanks?"

Nathaniel's voice softened. "No need. Not in your condition." His gaze flickered toward Samuel briefly before adding, "Just be a little sweeter to me. That's thanks enough."

Evelyn's cheeks pinkened. "I'm not a child," she muttered.

His chuckle was warm. "No, you're far more complicated than any child."

"What?" Her eyes narrowed. "That's ridiculous! I'm perfectly reasonable. If I'm ever upset, it's because you've done something to deserve it." She punctuated this with a light swat to his arm, a silent warning.

"Nathaniel Martin, if you dare come home tonight—"

His grin only widened.

A sudden snort from Samuel shattered the moment. Two pairs of eyes snapped toward him.

The secretary paled. "I'll just—" He practically sprinted from the room.

Evelyn pouted. "Now he'll think I'm some temperamental shrew."

"Do you honestly care what he thinks?" Nathaniel's tone carried an unexpected edge.

"Of course! If he gets the wrong impression—"

"You're my wife," Nathaniel cut in firmly. "His opinion means nothing."

Evelyn fell silent, lips pressed together.

Those three words echoed in her mind: You're my wife.

Did he realize the weight of what he'd just said? What it truly implied?
###Chapter 363 

Evelyn fell silent, her head dipping low. Hidden from Nathaniel's sight, the faintest smile curved her lips.

His words cut through the tension like sunlight piercing winter frost, thawing the chill in her chest.

With the competition approaching, Nathaniel checked the time before gently cupping her face. His voice was steady. "You'll do great. No nerves."

"Okay." Evelyn nodded.

They parted ways—Nathaniel followed Samuel to the viewing area while Evelyn headed to the adjacent green room.

She shared the news of their recovered files with the team. After exchanging quick words of encouragement, they moved backstage to prepare.

There, Evelyn froze.

The woman presenting design sketches on stage was unmistakable—the same sunglasses-clad figure she'd seen earlier with Charlotte.

A staff member supplied her name: Vivian Sterling, a designer from Dresden. Her work showcased impressive adaptability, earning nods from judges and murmurs from the audience. But Evelyn barely registered the praise. Her focus locked onto the sketches projected on screen, her expression unreadable.

Charlotte nudged her. "Evelyn. What's wrong?"

Evelyn blinked, then turned to Gabrielle and the others, her voice icy. "Do those look familiar?"

Gabrielle, Charlotte, and the rest followed her gaze. From their angle, they only caught a side view, but the 5D rendering displayed the full design. Gabrielle gasped. "Ms. Mitchell, those are—"

"Ours," Evelyn cut in sharply, mindful of nearby staff.

Silence dropped like a guillotine.

Charlotte understood first.

They retreated to a secluded corner. "Anyone know her?" Charlotte asked.

Blank stares all around.

Liam frowned. "How did this happen? Could she be the one who tampered with our system earlier?"

Gabrielle and Maxwell exchanged uneasy glances.

Evelyn, however, was already three steps ahead. Her tone was flat. "Doesn't matter who did it. Our work's been stolen. Now what?"

Liam, ever pragmatic, folded his arms. "If we proceed with our original designs, we'll be accused of plagiarism. First impression bias."

Evelyn gave a tight nod.

Maxwell ran a hand through his hair. "But without our sketches, we can't compete."

Gabrielle, inexperienced with high-stakes sabotage, looked lost. Charlotte turned to Evelyn. "Any backups?"

"No." Evelyn's jaw tightened. "Not just no backups—all our drafts and discarded sketches were destroyed."

Admitting they'd been stolen would directly implicate Vivian. But Evelyn had burned their rejects precisely to prevent misuse. Now, it had backfired spectacularly.

As Vivian finished her presentation, she descended the stage—and locked eyes with Evelyn. Her smile was a challenge.

Evelyn didn't flinch.

She met Vivian's gaze head-on, her expression coolly detached. A silent thought echoed in her mind: I didn't steal anything. Why should I look away?

###Chapter 364

Evelyn couldn't fathom where Vivian, a shameless plagiarist, found the audacity to challenge her.

Her eyes narrowed to slits. "I've got an idea."

Just then, the emcee announced her name.

The production crew asked for backup sketches to display. Evelyn simply instructed, "Project the competition poster first. Switch to blank white when I signal." The staff exchanged puzzled looks but complied.

Taking the stage, Evelyn gestured toward the massive screen behind her. After greeting the judges, she engaged the audience in a lively discussion about their farm fantasies. Meanwhile, Vivian watched the live feed with amusement.

Her assistant whispered, "Ms. Sterling, what's Evelyn plotting?"

Vivian smirked. "Doesn't matter. She's doing our work for us. This victory is already ours."

She dismissed Evelyn with a wave.

"Brilliant as always, Ms. Sterling," the assistant fawned.

Vivian typed a message: [Drinks tonight to celebrate?] The reply came instantly: [My place. We're getting properly wasted.]

Closing her phone, Vivian reclined on the sofa. "Wake me when it's over." The assistant muted the broadcast and draped a blanket over her.

Onstage, Evelyn created a brand-new design live, drawing thunderous applause. Some audience members looked confused. "Weren't you supposed to present prepared sketches?"

Evelyn answered without hesitation. "I had them. But I realized my vision alone wasn't enough. I needed your collective imagination to perfect this farm."

The judges' reactions were mixed - some impressed, others skeptical.

Perfection was impossible, after all.

Descending the stage, Evelyn found Nathaniel visibly surprised by her improvisation. He sent Samuel to investigate.

Cassandra overheard and remarked, "I didn't expect Evelyn to compete. But changing strategies last minute? Risky, don't you think?"

Nathaniel knew Evelyn never acted without reason. "The rules allow spontaneous designs."

"I'm not questioning her talent. But the judges seem divided. What if this gamble costs her the preliminaries?" Cassandra studied his face carefully.

His expression remained unreadable.

She pressed further. "Nathaniel, if she fails to advance... would you still let her continue?"
###Chapter 365

Nathaniel's gaze flickered toward Cassandra, his brow furrowing slightly in displeasure.

Cassandra quickly interjected, "Nathaniel, don't look at me like that. I'm only concerned about putting you in a difficult position. If Evelyn advances, it might stir discontent among the other designers. That wouldn't be good for her either. Don't you agree?"

His voice was low, edged with irritation. "The results aren't even out yet. Aren't you jumping to conclusions? Even if she doesn't make it, as long as she wants to stay, I'll make sure she does." His meaning was unmistakable.

This was blatant favoritism toward Evelyn.

Cassandra found it baffling.

Nathaniel had always maintained strict professionalism, never letting personal feelings interfere with business. Even in university, he was known for his impartiality. Yet now, he was bending his own rules for Evelyn.

Cassandra couldn't pinpoint why it unsettled her. She believed Nathaniel shouldn't compromise his principles for anyone.

But sensing his growing annoyance, she forced a faint smile and dropped the subject.

Soon, Samuel returned with the details and relayed them honestly.

"Mr. Martin, should we launch a public investigation into this matter?"

Nathaniel shook his head. "Find out who Vivian Sterling really is. Keep it discreet. I don’t want Evelyn dragged into unnecessary scrutiny."

Their relationship already put enough pressure on her. If she advanced now, people would assume it was because of him. He needed to maintain distance to avoid accusations of bias. He made it clear—anyone who leaked information would face consequences.

Cassandra stiffened, her face paling.

She wanted to tell Nathaniel outright that she wasn’t the type to scheme. If she had an issue, she’d confront it directly.

But to avoid conflict, she bit back her words.

The tension between them lingered for the rest of the competition.

An hour later, all the designers finished their presentations. The judges retreated for deliberation, leaving a thirty-minute break before announcing the top twenty.

In the lounge, Evelyn and her team chatted animatedly. Gabrielle and the others clapped enthusiastically. "Ms. Mitchell, you were incredible out there. Officially my new idol!"

"Until the next one comes along?"

Gabrielle laughed sheepishly. "No, seriously. Your improvisation was brilliant."

Charlotte nodded. "Evelyn has even more potential. If you three stick with her, you’ll go far."

Evelyn waved them off. "Enough flattery." She checked the time.

With the results still minutes away, she prepared them. "We did our best, but competitions are unpredictable. If we don’t advance, don’t take it personally. No regrets."

Gabrielle and the others exchanged glances. Liam spoke up. "Ms. Mitchell, we’re with you. The real injustice is how hard you worked, only for someone else to steal credit."

Max agreed. "It doesn’t matter to us. Whatever you decide, we’ll support you."

###Chapter 366

Gabrielle nodded solemnly. "At the end of the day, I'm responsible for what happened today, so—"

"I didn't say that to make you take the blame." Evelyn cut her off sharply. "I just need you to stay focused. Don't let this shake your confidence. There are bigger battles ahead."

She knew Gabrielle had a tendency to overanalyze and self-blame. That wasn't helpful right now.

Gabrielle's shoulders relaxed slightly at Evelyn's words.

Just then, the competition results were announced.

Twenty designers made the cut. Vivian Sterling was among them. So was Evelyn.

Evelyn barely scraped through at nineteenth place.

The team erupted in cheers, but Gabrielle scowled. "How did Vivian qualify? She didn't earn this. She's riding on our work."

Charlotte laughed lightly. "Look at it this way—if she got in, it's because of your designs. Ultimately, it proves Evelyn's brilliance. Your hard work paid off. You're all rising stars!"

Though delivered with humor, the truth in Charlotte's words was undeniable.

A faint blush colored Gabrielle's cheeks.

Meanwhile, tension crackled in another room.

Vivian was shaken awake by her assistant. "We made it through, but..."

"But what?" Vivian mumbled, still groggy.

"It's just... Evelyn Mitchell also qualified..."

"What?" Vivian bolted upright. "Evelyn got in? Are you certain?"

The assistant nodded hastily. "Yes, I watched the live announcement."

Panic flashed across Vivian's face before she schooled her features. "Pack up. I'll wait in the car." She grabbed her sunglasses and stormed out, assistants scrambling after her.

Inside the car, Vivian immediately dialed a number, her voice tight. "Evelyn made it? How? Her sketches were clearly—"

The voice on the other end sounded equally shocked but tried to reassure her. "Stay calm. She has no proof. Just keep your cool."

Vivian chewed her lip, face pale, mind racing.

She didn't notice Samuel Yates observing her every move.

As Evelyn's group left the venue for the parking garage, Charlotte suddenly asked, "You're really letting this go?"

Evelyn's eyes hardened. "Why would I? If someone steals from me, should I just thank them?"

She'd comforted her team to prevent morale from dropping. But she had no intention of letting this slide.

Since Vivian was from Dresden, that's where the investigation would start.

Charlotte smirked. "That's what I thought. I had Alexander look into her. Vivian's an up-and-coming designer from Dresden with ties to Danielle."

Evelyn's breath caught. Before she could respond, her phone buzzed.

###Chapter 367

The caller ID flashed Nathaniel's name.

Evelyn glanced at Charlotte and sighed. "If it's Danielle, I'm not surprised. She's always resented me, convinced I'm after Gregory."

"What's wrong with that Wilson family? Just answer the call already!"

Charlotte had never liked Gregory or his sister.

Evelyn tapped the answer button.

A warm, familiar voice filled her ear. "Have Charlotte take the company car back."

"Hmm?"

She scanned the street and spotted the familiar black sedan parked nearby.

Nathaniel continued, softer now. "Will you ride with me?"

The quiet plea in his tone made her lips curve. She remembered his words in the lounge earlier—how they'd settled deep in her chest.

"Alright," she murmured.

When the call ended, Charlotte smirked. "You’re practically glowing."

"Take them back to the office. Let Gregory wait there," Evelyn instructed.

Charlotte rolled her eyes. "Nathaniel’s so ruthless. When he needed me in Marseille, he called nonstop. Now that he’s back to spoiling his wife, I’m disposable?"

Evelyn knew her friend’s sharp humor. "Thomas is in the car too. Want to join us instead?"

Charlotte waved her off. "No thanks. See you later."

She climbed into the sedan, and Liam sped off without hesitation.

Evelyn watched them leave before turning toward Nathaniel’s car.

Inside, she buckled her seatbelt. "Shouldn’t you be at lunch with the others?"

It was well past noon.

Nathaniel shot her a look. "After today? I’ve lost my appetite."

She understood. The mess with Danielle still simmered under her skin.

Misreading her silence, he frowned. "Why didn’t you tell me about the stolen designs? If you’d spoken up, we could’ve paused the competition."

She’d considered it—but it felt unfair. "We made it through. That’s luck on our side."

"Optimistic," he noted.

"Better than drowning in negativity. Would you rather I sulk?"

He had no rebuttal.

Lately, he’d developed a habit of pinching her cheeks. Ever since she’d filled out slightly, her softness seemed to fascinate him.

At a red light, his hand covered hers. His voice dropped. "I had Samuel look into it. That designer—Vivian Sterling—is connected to Danielle. He’ll send you the details later. Might be useful."

Evelyn already knew about Vivian and Danielle. But Nathaniel’s swift action impressed her. Whatever Samuel dug up would be valuable.

"You investigated her immediately?" she whispered.

###Chapter 368

"Or should I just stand by and watch her walk all over you?"

"Nathaniel, you're too good to me," Evelyn murmured with a soft smile.

He scoffed, his grip tightening slightly on the steering wheel. "Only now you realize that?"

Her smile didn't fade, but she didn't answer his question either. Instead, she turned serious. "Thank you."

Nathaniel didn't respond. Gratitude wasn't what he wanted from her.

"You handled yourself well today," he said after a beat. "Your advancement had nothing to do with me. That was all you. I didn't pull any strings with the judges. Your win was clean."

Evelyn went quiet.

He'd read her mind. She had been worried—had prepared herself for the possibility that her success might be tied to his influence.

After a long pause, she finally nodded. "I know."

Nathaniel glanced at her just as the light turned green. He released her hand to grip the wheel properly, his expression unreadable.

He dropped her off at the office but didn’t go in. She had business to handle, and he wasn’t about to interfere.

The moment Evelyn stepped into the office, the tension was palpable. Gabrielle and the others had already briefed Gregory about Vivian Sterling stealing her design during the livestream.

Evelyn didn’t waste time. She headed straight for Gregory’s office and shut the door behind her.

Before she could even speak, Gregory was already apologizing. "Evelyn, I had no idea Danielle would do something like this. I’ve already called her. She’s on her way to fix this."

So he knew about Vivian too.

Evelyn exhaled. "Gregory, if this puts you in an awkward position, I can handle Danielle myself."

"No." His voice was firm. "I won’t enable her this time. She’s an adult. She needs to take responsibility for her actions. And this—this isn’t just some petty issue. This is your hard work. I know what it means to you."

Evelyn nodded. If he understood, then there was nothing more to say.

Ten minutes later, Danielle stormed into the office.

She marched straight into Gregory’s office, only to freeze when she saw Evelyn sitting there. Her face twisted in displeasure.

She turned to Gregory, eyes flashing. "Why is she here? I thought you wanted to talk to me. Tell her to leave. I don’t want her here."

"Enough, Danielle." Gregory’s voice was ice. "Stop acting like a child."

Ever since he’d last lost his temper with her, Danielle had developed a wariness around him. There were things between them—private, unspoken things—that made her hesitate to push him too far.

"Gregory..."

"Did you steal Evelyn’s design and give it to Vivian?"

Danielle stiffened. Then her eyes narrowed. "Is that why you called me here? Because of her? Did she put you up to this?"

She jabbed a finger in Evelyn’s direction, her expression venomous. "Evelyn, what’s your game? Trying to turn my brother against me? Where’s your proof? If you don’t have any, then shut your mouth."

"Vivian’s your friend, isn’t she? That design was mine. So unless you’re suggesting someone else stole it for her, who else could it be?" Evelyn’s voice was calm, but her gaze was sharp.

Danielle laughed, high and mocking. "Oh, so now you’re the victim? Just because she’s my friend, that means I’m guilty? Where’s your evidence? Or are you just jealous?"

Evelyn almost rolled her eyes. "I don’t even know her. Why would I be jealous?"

###Chapter 369

"Who can say? Someone like you is capable of anything, no matter how disgraceful."

Danielle refused to back down, while Evelyn studied her with sharp intensity.

Gregory's voice turned icy. "Danielle, it's just the three of us here. Confess now, and you might salvage this. Or would you rather have the whole world know?"

"Gregory, so you don’t trust me? I already told you—I didn’t do it. I have better things to do than obsess over her. If you won’t believe me, fine. Show me proof if you have any!"

Danielle was certain they had nothing. If they had evidence, they wouldn’t be interrogating me like this. They’d just shove it in my face and force a confession.

Did it matter if she was involved?

Not really.

The only thing that mattered was seeing Evelyn squirm. That alone was worth it.

Danielle smirked, tilting her chin up in challenge. Go ahead. Prove it.

Evelyn’s lips curved slightly. "So, Danielle, if I can prove it was you, you’ll admit it?"

A flicker of hesitation.

But Danielle wasn’t worried. She straightened, meeting Evelyn’s gaze head-on. "Sure. If you have proof, I’ll own up to it. But what if you can’t?"

Evelyn’s smile deepened. "Deal. Your brother is our witness. If I fail, I’ll apologize. Fair?"

Danielle scoffed. "An apology? Worthless. If you can’t prove it, you owe me one favor—no questions asked."

Every word was being recorded.

Evelyn played it back.

Danielle stiffened. "What the hell is this?"

"Insurance," Evelyn said lightly. "So you can’t backtrack later. Smart, don’t you think?"

Danielle’s confidence wavered—but only for a second. She’s bluffing. There’s no way she has anything.

Evelyn turned to Gregory, sending him the screenshots.

His expression darkened as he scrolled. "Danielle. Did you really conspire with Vivian to do this?"

He shoved the phone in her face.

Her own messages stared back at her—plans to sabotage Evelyn, arrangements to steal her work and hand it to Vivian.

Her stomach dropped.

How?

Gregory’s voice was lethal. "Do you realize how petty and illegal this is?"

Silence.

His jaw clenched. "I’ve warned you—repeatedly—to leave her alone. If you have a problem, you cto me. Are my words just noise to you?"

Danielle’s defiance crumbled.

But it was too late.

Evelyn had already won.

###Chapter 370

Danielle pressed her lips into a thin line, her fists clenched so tight her knuckles turned white. There wasn't an ounce of regret in her voice—only defiance. "So what if I did it? I can't stand her. She doesn't deserve an easy life. The more you defend her, the more it makes me sick. I hate her."

"Danielle, you—"

Gregory's expression darkened, his jaw tightening.

She cut him off before he could finish. "What, you want to hit me again? But you know damn well—"

"Enough!" Gregory snapped, his patience gone. He turned to Evelyn, voice strained. "Evelyn, what do you think—"

Evelyn's tone was ice. "So you'd break the law just because you dislike me? Danielle, let me be clear—it's not worth it. If I were you, I'd go to Vivian right now. Convince her to withdraw from the competition and issue a public apology. Do that, and I won't press charges." She still had her own reputation to protect in this competition. Escalating things further would only backfire.

Danielle scoffed. "Your screenshots prove nothing. I could say you faked them!"

Evelyn smiled, slow and knowing. "So you're denying it?"

"I didn't do it. Why would I admit to something I didn't do?"

"You said you'd admit it if the evidence was clear."

"Your evidence is worthless."

Evelyn nodded, almost amused. "Fine. I hope you keep that same energy when the truth comes out. If you fold then, I'll lose what little respect I still have for you."

With that, she stood and walked out.

Gregory hurried after her. "Evelyn, I swear I'll handle this. I—"

She stopped him with a raised hand. "Gregory, stay out of it. Your involvement only complicates things. I don't owe her any consideration." Her words left no room for argument.

Back in her office, Charlotte was waiting. "Well?"

"Nothing," Evelyn said.

Charlotte frowned. "So what's the plan?"

Evelyn smirked. "I have an idea."

She opened her laptop and sent out the edited chat logs.

Evelyn wasn't about to sit back and let them destroy her. Not when the real thief was still out there.

Once the email was sent, Charlotte asked, "What about Vivian and Danielle?"

Evelyn glanced at the clock. "You'll see in an hour."

"Keeping me in suspense?" Charlotte teased.

"Gotta keep you on your toes," Evelyn shot back with a grin.

Charlotte laughed. "Oh, I never doubted you."

As long as Evelyn wasn't being walked over, Charlotte could relax.

Despite making it through the day unscathed, the tension lingered.

Meanwhile, in a luxury hotel suite, Vivian's phone rang. The caller ID made her blood run cold.

She answered, her face paling with every word. She didn't dare argue.

The call lasted less than thirty seconds before ending abruptly. Vivian immediately dialed another number—but no one picked up.

She closed her eyes, her expression hardening. Finally, she gave in.

"Call the competition organizers," she told her assistant. "We're withdrawing."

"Withdrawing? But why?" Her assistant was baffled.

Vivian didn't answer. She just stared out the window, her grip tightening on her phone.

###Chapter 371

"Stop questioning me. Just follow my orders." Vivian's voice was sharp, her expression unyielding.

She quickly accessed her Instagram account and posted a brief confession.

[I deeply regret to inform you all that I'm withdrawing from the competition. The design I submitted was not my original work. I plagiarized someone else's creation. The guilt has become unbearable, and I must come clean. I sincerely apologize and ask for your forgiveness. This will never happen again.]

With her massive following and active engagement, the post instantly ignited outrage. While a few sympathized, most fans felt betrayed. Speculations swirled about whose work had been stolen—Evelyn's name surfaced but remained unconfirmed.

The competition's official page swiftly responded, reposting Vivian's statement and urging her to reflect on her actions. Their acknowledgment solidified the plagiarism scandal.

Vivian slipped on oversized sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat, concealing her identity completely. "To the airport," she instructed her assistant. "We're returning to Dresden."

The assistant nodded, signaling the driver.

In a hushed whisper, the assistant ventured, "Ms. Sterling, this could damage your reputation in the industry. Maybe we should confront Evelyn directly?"

Vivian exhaled sharply. "This isn't my decision to make."

Danielle had dragged her into this mess. And with Danielle's ties to the Wilson family in Dresden, resistance was futile.

Danielle's father had personally called Vivian, demanding her withdrawal and a public apology. The ultimatum was clear: comply or be blacklisted from the industry.

Vivian had no choice but to obey.

Yet, she deliberately omitted Evelyn's name in her apology. Even she wasn't entirely sure why.

Charlotte was equally confused. "Shouldn't she have exposed Evelyn?"

"I don’t want a target on my back," Evelyn replied calmly. "With two more rounds left, if it gets out that I was the victim, people might assume I'm playing the sympathy card. The competition's integrity would be questioned, and the Martin Group would face unnecessary scrutiny. This outcome is clean."

Whether her name was mentioned didn’t matter. The message to Vivian and Danielle was clear—Evelyn wasn’t someone they could push around.

Vivian left for Dresden. Danielle, meanwhile, faced her father's wrath and was ordered to return immediately. Her privileges hung by a thread—defy him, and she'd be cut off from the Wilson family entirely.

Bitter but compliant, Danielle swore to make Evelyn pay in the next round.

Gregory called to apologize on Danielle's behalf, but Evelyn cut him off. "This isn’t your fault. Don’t apologize for her."

"Evelyn, are you angry with me?" Gregory pressed.

"Why would I be?"

He kept apologizing until Charlotte finally interrupted. "How did you get Danielle’s father to bend to your will so easily?"

Evelyn smirked. "Guess."

Charlotte rolled her eyes. Is she turning into Nathaniel?

With the plagiarism scandal settled, the second round loomed in twenty days. Evelyn refocused—designs to perfect, Martin Group projects to oversee.

###Chapter 372

Evelyn was now four months pregnant. To the untrained eye, her condition wasn't obvious, but those who knew could see the subtle changes in her posture and energy levels.

Charlotte had taken charge of reviewing Evelyn's architectural drafts while mentoring Gabrielle and the junior designers. This freed Evelyn to concentrate on the Martin Corporation projects.

Her morning had been spent at the construction site delivering exterior designs to Daniel Carter and inspecting materials. By afternoon, she found herself heading to Martin Corporation headquarters with finalized blueprints for Nathaniel's approval.

Samuel Yates looked surprised when Evelyn arrived unannounced. "Mrs. Martin," he greeted smoothly, "Mr. Martin is in his office. Shall I announce you?"

"No need," Evelyn waved him off, striding toward the double doors with her portfolio.

She expected to find Nathaniel alone. "Mr. Martin," she began playfully as she entered, "are you too busy for—" The words died in her throat.

Cassandra Montgomery sat in Nathaniel's chair while he leaned over his desk, their heads close together in conversation. Both wore matching smiles that faltered when the door opened.

Nathaniel straightened immediately. "Evelyn." He crossed the room in three strides while Evelyn remained frozen in the doorway.

"I apologize for interrupting," she said coolly, her grip tightening on her portfolio. "I brought the finalized designs. If this isn't a good time—"

"Any time you come is a good time." Nathaniel studied her face intently, searching for any reaction.

Evelyn maintained perfect composure as he guided her to the sitting area.

Cassandra rose gracefully. "Evelyn, congratulations on advancing past the preliminary judging. Your on-site presentation was impressive."

"Thank you, though there's still room for improvement," Evelyn replied with practiced politeness.

Their gazes locked for a charged moment before Cassandra turned to Nathaniel. "I'll let you two discuss business. I could use some coffee."

"Ask Samuel to have someone show you to the lounge," Nathaniel suggested.

"Will do." Cassandra flashed Evelyn a parting smile. "Until next time."

The moment the door clicked shut, Evelyn's polite mask slipped. She turned to Nathaniel, all business. "Do you have any revisions for these designs? Otherwise, I'll leave them with Mr. Carter."

Nathaniel's eyes darkened. "Is that really why you came?"

He moved closer, his intense gaze never leaving her face.

"What other reason would there be?" Evelyn countered lightly. "I came straight from the construction site. Feel free to verify with Daniel."

"So clinical," Nathaniel murmured, stepping into her space. "No room for interpretation? Just cold facts laid bare?"

"I thought you preferred honesty," Evelyn quipped.

Nathaniel's expression shifted. Before she could react, he closed the distance between them.

His lips crashed against hers with sudden urgency, cutting off her next words. Evelyn found herself pressed into the sofa cushions with no chance of retreat.

Every movement flowed with practiced ease—as if he'd rehearsed this moment countless times in his mind.

###Chapter 373

The kiss went on forever, starting soft and ending deep. Only when Evelyn was gasping for air did Nathaniel finally pull away.

His breathing was ragged, voice rough with desire. "Ever since Charlotte arrived, you've been freezing me out. Tell her to go back to Dresden tonight. I'm done sharing you."

Evelyn arched a brow. "So you use her and toss her aside?"

"She won't stop clinging to you," Nathaniel muttered, sounding almost petulant.

"We're close friends."

"Do friends need to be attached at the hip?"

Evelyn crossed her arms. "What about you? You've been practically living at the office with Cassandra these days. I haven't said a word."

Nathaniel's lips curved. "Jealous?"

"Not even slightly."

He tilted her chin up, searching her face. "Really? Or just too proud to admit it?"

Evelyn met his gaze head-on. "Would you like me to be jealous?"

"Could I make you jealous if I tried?"

She scoffed. "Nathaniel, a man who needs to provoke jealousy isn't impressive. A truly remarkable man wouldn't make a woman fight for his attention."

His thumb brushed her lower lip. "So if I want to make you jealous, I'm not remarkable?"

"I didn't say that."

His grin turned wolfish. "Then if you don't want to feel jealous, keep me on a tighter leash."

Evelyn stayed silent, puzzled by his meaning.

She never answered that question. The thought of controlling Nathaniel had never crossed her mind—their relationship had always tilted in his favor. Even when she'd later insisted on divorce, retaliation wasn't in her nature.

With the project deadline looming, Evelyn spent every day at the construction site. Between drafting blueprints and inspecting materials with Daniel, there was no room for error.

Each evening, she brought the plans to Martin Group for Nathaniel's approval.

For three straight days, Cassandra was there—perched on his desk chair, lounging on his sofa, their conversations flowing effortlessly. All business, yet their chemistry was undeniable.

At five o'clock sharp, Evelyn arrived again, this time to drag Nathaniel to the hospital. Beatrice had specifically requested his company, worried about tension between them after his recent absence.

Outside his office, Samuel stood abruptly. "Mrs. Martin."

"Is he busy?"

"Mr. Martin and Ms. Montgomery are finalizing project details."

"I'll wait."

Samuel gestured to the lounge, but Evelyn declined, choosing to stand.

Thirty minutes later, the door swung open. Nathaniel and Cassandra emerged, the latter mid-laugh. "Tonight's going to be unforgettable—you promised—"

"Evelyn." Nathaniel's voice softened as he approached. "How long have you been out here? You should've come in." He shot Samuel a glare. "Why didn't you bring her inside?"

Evelyn cut in. "I chose to wait. Don't blame Samuel."

Nathaniel fell silent.

Cassandra smiled brightly. "Evelyn! We were just planning dinner. You should join us."

###Chapter 374 

Evelyn's brows knitted together as her gaze instinctively flicked to Nathaniel. "No thanks," she said coolly. "Since you two already have plans, you should go ahead without me."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "You're not joining us for dinner?"

"No need. I just happened to be passing by, wondering if you were free to leave together. But since you're busy with Ms. Montgomery, I'll head back alone." Evelyn forced a polite smile, nodding at Cassandra before turning away sharply.

The moment her back was turned, the smile vanished.

Nathaniel caught up in an instant, his fingers curling around her wrist. "Let's go downstairs together," he murmured, voice low.

Evelyn didn't resist, letting him guide her silently. The three of them stepped into the elevator, tension thick in the confined space.

At the lobby, Nathaniel walked her to the car, holding the door open. "Should I ask Charlotte to join you for dinner? What would you like? I'll arrange it."

"Don’t bother. Ms. Montgomery is waiting—you shouldn’t keep her." Evelyn waved dismissively, signaling the driver to leave.

As the car pulled away, she exhaled sharply. "Take me to the hospital first."

She stopped at a bakery along the way, picking up Beatrice’s favorite pastries. At the hospital, she chatted lightly with her grandmother, carefully mentioning Nathaniel’s absence—blaming his hectic schedule. Beatrice, ever understanding, simply patted her hand and urged her to go home.

Dinner was a quiet affair. Charlotte had made spaghetti, but the silence between them was heavy.

Charlotte studied her for a long moment before finally breaking it. "You’re not going to tell me what’s wrong?"

Evelyn pushed her plate aside. "Nathaniel has this... college friend. They're working together now. Every time I go to the Martin Group, she’s there. And I just—" She hesitated. "We barely talk about anything beyond the baby, or Beatrice, or family obligations. It’s like we’re strangers."

Charlotte nodded slowly. "If there’s no common ground, make some. But if she’s as smart as she seems, she should know better than to hover around a married man. Unless she wants something."

"That’s her problem, not mine." Evelyn shrugged. It wasn’t Cassandra she was worried about—it was the growing distance between her and Nathaniel. The way work consumed him, leaving little room for anything else.

A confident woman didn’t waste time on jealousy.

That had always been Evelyn’s mantra. But with Cassandra monopolizing Nathaniel’s time, she’d started avoiding the Martin Group altogether. Out of sight, out of mind.

Two days passed uneventfully—until the call came from Martin Manor. Edward wanted them for dinner.

Evelyn hesitated, then dialed Nathaniel. "Your grandfather wants us there tonight. Should I go first, or wait for you?"

###Chapter 375

"Absolutely. Should I meet you at the company or have my driver take you to Martin Group headquarters?" Nathaniel's deep voice resonated through the phone. "Or perhaps I'll come straight to the estate after work?"

Evelyn tapped her fingers against her phone case. "I'll come find you." This would save them both time.

Just as she finished speaking, Cassandra's voice interrupted. "Nathaniel, are you taking Evelyn to Martin Estate? Mind if I join?"

Evelyn's grip tightened on her phone.

Cassandra continued smoothly, "My father sent some gifts and requested I pay my respects to Mr. Martin. It would be less awkward if I accompanied you both. Unless that's inconvenient?" Nathaniel remained silent, considering.

Evelyn said nothing, though the call was still connected.

Cassandra quickly added, "If it's troublesome, I can visit another time. I merely thought since you're both going and my schedule is clear, it wouldn't affect work. But really, it's fine—"

"We'll go together," Nathaniel finally answered.

Cassandra's voice remained perfectly composed. "I wouldn't want to intrude on family time."

"You won't be."

With that settled, Evelyn ended the call without another word. She texted Nathaniel: [Since Ms. Montgomery is joining you, I'll head to the estate first to inform them. No need to pick me up.]

Truthfully, she'd rather not be part of this little excursion anyway.

Tucking her phone away, Evelyn didn't check for any reply. The driver took her straight to Martin Estate. Knowing the estate was fully stocked, she only brought some fresh fruits.

Victoria greeted Evelyn with her usual warmth, though it had been days since their last meeting. Richard remained his gentle, caring self, while Edward still doted on Evelyn shamelessly.

After catching up, Evelyn mentioned, "Victoria, please prepare extra dishes. Cassandra Montgomery will be joining Nathaniel to visit Edward."

Victoria's smile faltered slightly. Studying Evelyn's expression carefully, she asked, "Cassandra is coming? With Nathaniel?"

Richard recognized the name. "The Madison heiress from Salzburg? Nathaniel's university classmate?"

Edward frowned. "Who is this Cassandra?"

Evelyn explained, "From the Montgomery family in Salzburg. She and Nathaniel studied together."

Edward gave a dismissive nod. "At my age, I prefer fewer visitors. Our ties with the Montgomerys are ancient history. We've all done well maintaining distance these years." Evelyn couldn't help smiling at his protective tone.

The conversation shifted to Evelyn's pregnancy. Victoria said, "Over four months now! We'll meet this little one soon. Don't worry about preparations—I've handled everything for you and the baby. Have you and Nathaniel discussed names?"

Evelyn rested a hand on her stomach. "Why don't Edward and Richard decide?"

Both men chuckled. "We'll brainstorm some options for you to choose from."

Victoria then asked, "Shall we arrange a gender reveal scan soon?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Let's keep it a surprise. Edward?"

The patriarch smiled. "Boy or girl, this will be my first grandchild—our family's greatest treasure."

###Chapter 376 

Nathaniel's confidence was unmistakable.

Evelyn, however, had no hidden agenda. She merely considered that knowing the baby's gender could simplify shopping, but it wasn't essential. They'd prepare for both possibilities. Finances weren't a concern.

Their discussion was interrupted by Alfred's announcement. "Mr. Martin has returned."

Nathaniel and Cassandra entered together.

Cassandra carried an elegant gift box. She greeted Edward, Richard, and Evelyn politely. "Mr. Martin, Richard, Evelyn, good evening. I apologize for dropping by unannounced."

She expressed regret for disrupting their family dinner.

Edward responded evenly, "No need for formalities. We hope you'll join us for this modest meal."

Given Cassandra's gracious manner, everyone responded with equal courtesy.

Cassandra then discussed the Madison Group's collaboration with Martin Enterprises with Richard and Edward. Despite her feminine appearance, she possessed a sharp business mind. As the Madison family's sole heir, she was destined to lead the corporation.

Cassandra joked lightly. "My father constantly worries I'll never find a husband capable of managing bothand the company. For now, the burden falls entirely on my shoulders."

Edward remarked, "Modern society values equality. Partnerships require balance. If both spouses devote themselves entirely to business, the marriage loses its meaning. Consider Nathaniel's parents, and Nathaniel and Evelyn's relationship."

Cassandra paused, then smiled. "You're absolutely right. My father shares that philosophy. If I found a man who could handle bothand the Madison Group, I'd happily embrace the role of devoted wife and mother."

Edward simply nodded without further comment.

Evelyn inquired, "How is Beatrice doing?"

"Her condition remains stable. Once she's stronger, the surgery can proceed."

"That's good. Please keep us updated. You should rest more during your pregnancy. Let Nathaniel handle things. I can also send over nourishing meals."

"Thank you, I appreciate that."

The bond between Evelyn and Victoria resembled that of mother and daughter. Cassandra observed wistfully, "Evelyn, you're so kind to Victoria. I lost my mother young. I can only hope my future mother-in-law will be like you."

Victoria smiled gently. "I'm certain she will be."

Everyone knew of Cassandra's early bereavement. As both a mother and woman, Victoria couldn't help feeling sympathetic.

Over dinner, Cassandra reminisced about school days when Victoria would cook for her. "Victoria, I'll always be grateful for your kindness back then."

"Those were simple times. I'm touched you still remember, Ms. Montgomery."

"Please, callCassandra. 'Ms. Montgomery' feels too formal between us."

Victoria smiled noncommittally, neither agreeing nor disagreeing.

Since Cassandra and Nathaniel's arrival, Evelyn had spoken little, only responding to Victoria or Edward. She deliberately avoided looking at Nathaniel, maintaining her distance.

As evening deepened and with Cassandra present, Victoria didn't prolong their visit, allowing them to depart after dinner.

The three left Martin Manor together. Evelyn spoke first. "I need to visit Beatrice at the hospital, so I'll take separate transportation."

Her driver had brought her earlier and would return her now.

Before Evelyn could finish, Nathaniel immediately turned to her. "We'll go together. I'll take Cassandra to her hotel first, then accompany you to see Beatrice, alright?"

###Chapter 377 

"No need for complications. You can escort Ms. Montgomery back to the hotel while I visit Beatrice at the hospital alone." Evelyn's refusal was firm, her sharp gaze locking onto Nathaniel.

His brow furrowed. "Evelyn, it's late. I don't like the idea of you going by yourself."

"I have a driver. What's there to fear? Besides, I managed just fine earlier, didn't I?"

A knowing smile played on Evelyn's lips.

Cassandra sensed the tension and interjected. "Evelyn, are you upset because of Nathaniel and me? I only visited Sir Edward at my father's request, not to cause trouble. If I've offended you, I apologize. You're pregnant—stress isn't good for the baby."

"Thank you for your concern, Ms. Montgomery. The baby is mine, and I know what's best. Since you've never been pregnant or a mother, I believe I have more experience in this matter. Your worry is unnecessary."

Evelyn's tone was cool, her expression unreadable. But Nathaniel knew better—this wasn't her usual demeanor when content.

He reached for her hand. "Let me come with you. Dr. Harrison called earlier about Beatrice's surgery. I need to discuss it with him. We'll go together, alright?"

Only Beatrice's name could soften Evelyn's resolve.

Nathaniel took the wheel, Evelyn beside him, Cassandra in the backseat.

Cassandra leaned forward. "Evelyn, between your pregnancy, the upcoming competition, Martin Group projects, and caring for Beatrice, isn't it too much?"

"I can handle it. The timing isn't overlapping."

Cassandra nodded. "You don’t have to push yourself so hard. With Nathaniel, you could have an easier life."

"Appreciate the thought, Ms. Montgomery. But everyone has their own path, don’t they?"

No matter how accomplished Nathaniel was or how stable their relationship, Evelyn believed in maintaining her career and independence.

After dropping Cassandra off, silence settled between them on the way to the hospital.

At Dr. Harrison's office, they learned Beatrice was stable enough for surgery and needed psychological preparation.

By the time they left Beatrice's ward, night had fallen.

Hand in hand, stepping into the cool evening air, Nathaniel finally broke the silence. "Are you angry with me?"

"Should I be?"

"Is this about Cassandra?"

"Why would it be about her? Nathaniel, what makes you think that?"

"Because I agreed to go to the manor with her? Or because we've been working closely lately?"

He wasn’t entirely sure, but these were the only recent events that might have caused tension.

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Nathaniel, if our roles were reversed—if Cassandra were a man—how would you feel?"

Nathaniel went quiet.

Gazing at the city lights, Evelyn continued calmly, "Isn’t marriage about mutual understanding?"

She wouldn’t demand he distance himself from Cassandra. Instead, she flipped the scenario, letting him reflect—and hopefully, choose to change on his own.

###Chapter 378

Nathaniel had always recognized Evelyn's sharp intellect. A single hint from her would suffice, yet she preferred letting others reach conclusions independently. He shook his head with an amused smile.

What he didn't realize was Evelyn's strategy - maintaining her dignity by never appearing submissive.

Cassandra had been shadowing Nathaniel in Marseille for nearly two weeks now. Their professional collaboration was common knowledge, something Isabella had accidentally uncovered.

She remembered Cassandra all too well. The icy treatment she'd given the woman years ago resurfaced in her memory. Seeing Cassandra hovering around Nathaniel again ignited her fury.

Isabella stormed into the hospital room without warning. "How can you be so passive?" she spat at Evelyn. "Nathaniel's practically attached to Cassandra's hip and you're just watching? Don't you see she's after him?" Evelyn merely chuckled.

The audacity astonished her.

"By what authority?" Evelyn's voice turned glacial. "Why does this concern you so much, Isabella?"

"You... You don't deserve to be his wife. Your position as Mrs. Martin won't last long. Mark my words!" Isabella hissed before storming out.

Evelyn dismissed the empty threats. Her days were too precious to waste on petty drama.

Humiliated, Isabella went straight to confront Cassandra.

Their explosive argument left Isabella speechless and defeated. Outmaneuvered at every turn, she retreated in disgrace. Later that day, Cassandra surprised Evelyn with a call. "Free for afternoon tea?"

They met at an upscale jazz lounge near Evelyn's office.

Their drinks arrived as Cassandra broke the silence. "I hope this isn't disrupting your schedule."

Evelyn shook her head. "Not at all. What's on your mind?"

"Honestly? Isabella approached me earlier with some... unpleasant remarks."

"You think I sent her?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

Cassandra's denial came swiftly. "Not at all. I wanted complete transparency. I've admired Nathaniel for years, though I've never acted on it. First Isabella, now you... perhaps friendship is our only path forward."

Evelyn studied her carefully. "I must admit, Ms. Montgomery, confessing this to the wife is... unexpected."

"Because it's the truth." Cassandra held her gaze steadily. "But know this - I respect marriage boundaries. My feelings are mine alone. If I've overstepped recently, I apologize."

Evelyn recognized the fundamental difference between Cassandra and Isabella.

"Your candor surprises me," Evelyn admitted. "But you're right about maintaining distance. Public perception matters, regardless of intentions."

"I appreciate your honesty. Perhaps we could become friends someday."

Evelyn raised her glass. "I'd like that."

Their glasses clinked, sealing an unspoken truce.

As Evelyn slid into her car afterward, Nathaniel's call came through immediately. His voice carried unusual tension. "Evelyn. Where are you?"


###Chapter 379 

Evelyn sent her location and asked, "What is it?"

"Did you meet with Cassandra?"

Nathaniel's tone was calm, but it carried an undercurrent of something sharper—like an accusation wrapped in velvet.

Evelyn's eyes narrowed slightly. "Yes, I just saw her."

Nathaniel softened his voice. "Evelyn, if there's anything you want to know, ask me. Cassandra and I are just old friends and colleagues. If it bothers you, I can reassign the project. Okay?"

Evelyn frowned. "Are you explaining yourself to me?"

"What else would you call it?"

"Do you think I met her because I'm upset? Are you worried my mood will affect the baby?"

"Evelyn." His voice dropped, edged with warning. "Then why did you meet her?"

"Just to talk. What else would we do?"

Her tone was light, giving nothing away.

Nathaniel exhaled. "You're really not upset?"

"Do I strike you as the type to go looking for drama?"

"That's not what I meant. I just don’t want misunderstandings. If you have questions, ask me. I’ll tell you everything."

"Always?"

"Always."

The sincerity in his voice made her smile.

But Evelyn didn’t press further. It was a promise from Nathaniel—one she might need later.

The call left her in better spirits. Then Dr. Harrison called with good news.

"Winifred’s recovery is progressing well. We’ll begin prepping for the transplant soon. Once she’s stable, we can proceed. Talk to Beatrice first, then let me know."

"Understood. Thank you, Dr. Harrison."

After hanging up, Evelyn went straight to the hospital.

Outside Beatrice’s room, she overheard two nurses whispering.

"Did you hear? Isabella’s mother is scheduled for surgery, but Isabella hasn’t visited in days. Her own mother, and she can’t even show up? What kind of daughter does that?"

"Who knows? Maybe she’s busy. She is a celebrity."

"Still. It’s cruel."

Evelyn knocked and entered, pushing the conversation aside.

When Beatrice heard about Winifred’s surgery, she finally agreed to cooperate.

A nurse arrived for routine bloodwork, so Evelyn wheeled Beatrice out.

Beatrice fussed. "I can walk. You shouldn’t be pushing me around in your condition."

Evelyn laughed. "If you don’t mention it, no one will even notice. Maybe they’ll think I’m unmarried."

"Always joking."

"Only because you indulge me. Who else would I tease?"

Beatrice waved her off. "Go bother someone else, then."

"Liar. You’d miss me."

Beatrice scoffed, but her lips curved into a smile.

###Chapter 380

Their conversation continued as they approached the blood collection center.

Evelyn knocked before pushing Beatrice inside. The room was partitioned with curtains, other patients already present. A nurse helped Beatrice onto the examination table for the blood draw. Unexpectedly, a nurse's voice inquired, "Why didn't your daughter accompany you today?"

"She's busy rehearsing for her symphony performance," came the familiar reply.

Evelyn instantly recognized Winifred's voice.

Her brows furrowed slightly. So Isabella hadn't bothered to come with her mother to the hospital.

Evelyn dismissed the thought, merely overhearing the exchange as she passed by.

After Beatrice's procedure, Evelyn wheeled her grandmother ahead while Simon assisted Winifred behind them. At Beatrice's insistence, Evelyn wore a mask, remaining unrecognized. Just as she considered increasing their distance, Simon's irritated voice carried from behind. "Isabella hasn't visited in weeks. Does she no longer care?"

"Lower your voice!" Winifred hissed. "What if someone hears? Isabella may not share our blood, but she's already done more than enough. Push too hard and she might sever ties completely." Simon seemed to accept this logic, falling silent.

The revelation struck Evelyn like lightning.

Isabella wasn't their biological child.

The shock left Evelyn reeling. Her first thought was whether Nathaniel knew.

After settling Beatrice back in her room, Evelyn went straight to Martin Group headquarters.

Cassandra Montgomery happened to be there. Since their recent heart-to-heart, the tension between them had eased. They exchanged polite nods before Cassandra discreetly excused herself, leaving Evelyn alone with Nathaniel. "I accompanied Beatrice for her tests today," Evelyn began. "Guess what I discovered?"

Her unreadable expression piqued Nathaniel's curiosity.

"Playing mysterious? What did you hear?" Nathaniel asked with an amused smile.

Evelyn's tone turned serious. "Did Isabella ever tell you she's not biologically related to her parents?"

"No," Nathaniel answered calmly, showing no surprise.

Evelyn frowned. "Nathaniel, doesn't that seem strange to you?"

"I've known for some time," he admitted.

"Did she confess it herself?"

"Samuel uncovered it." Nathaniel revealed this without hesitation.

Yet Evelyn pressed, "And that doesn't bother you?"

"Why should it?" Nathaniel's genuine confusion only deepened Evelyn's bewilderment.

Now Evelyn was the perplexed one.

She studied Nathaniel intently, suddenly at a loss for words. "She lied to you," Evelyn pointed out. "That doesn't upset you?"

"It's her personal matter, not mine," Nathaniel replied, his expression serene, his tone indifferent. To him, it clearly held no significance.

But his response carried different implications for Evelyn.

She suddenly regretted coming to share Winifred's revelation. Initially shocked, she'd wondered if Isabella had ever told Nathaniel the truth.

If not, it constituted deception.

She'd sought clarity.

Now Nathaniel's response made her feel petty.

Even if Isabella's secrecy was questionable, Evelyn's actions amounted to gossip.

A self-deprecating smile touched her lips as she silently chastised herself.

When you loved someone, you accepted their flaws unconditionally.

With a quiet sigh, Evelyn offered, "My apologies. I overstepped. Of course you wouldn't care - you love her too much to let such things matter."

###Chapter 381 

Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn, his lips curling into a cool smirk as he murmured, "Who told you I loved Isabella? Do you really believe my indifference means I care for her?" Evelyn froze, her breath catching as his words sent an uneasy tremor through her.

"Isn't it obvious?" she countered, refusing to look away.

"Absolutely not." Nathaniel's grip tightened around her wrist, his voice dropping to a velvet whisper. "Evelyn, I've never once said I loved Isabella. Where did you get such a ridiculous idea?"

"Your actions speak louder than words," Evelyn shot back.

Her nails dug into her palm, the pain grounding her. She wanted to scream at him - how dare he make her spell out his affection for another woman!

Unaware of her inner turmoil, Nathaniel only saw the defiance flashing in her eyes.

"You claim my every move proves my love for Isabella," he challenged, stepping closer. "Then tell me, what do all my actions toward you signify?"

Evelyn's world tilted.

Her lips parted soundlessly, eyes widening in shock. Time seemed to freeze as she stood motionless.

Nathaniel's intense stare never wavered. The irritation melted into something darker, more predatory. "Evelyn," he purred, tracing her jawline, "why so silent? After everything I've done for you...what do you think it means?"

Her lashes fluttered downward, heart hammering against her ribs.

The air between them grew thick, charged with unspoken tension. She could hear his steady breathing, smell his intoxicating cologne wrapping around her like a second skin.

When she remained mute, Nathaniel tilted her chin up forcibly.

Those obsidian eyes burned into hers. "Answer me, Evelyn."

"I...I don't know," she whispered.

The truth was, she'd agonized over this very question.

From trivial daily inconveniences to life-altering crises, Nathaniel had intervened without hesitation. Why?

"Because I'm his wife?" she wondered. "Or just the vessel carrying his heir?"

No other explanations made sense.

Certainly not love.

Nathaniel's low chuckle sent shivers down her spine. His thumb brushed her lower lip as he murmured, "You truly don't understand?"

Evelyn bit her tongue, refusing to rise to the bait.

His expression darkened, brows drawing together. "Tell me, Evelyn - do you honestly believe I'd go to such lengths merely out of marital obligation?"

Her skeptical silence answered for her.

The smile vanished from his face. "If duty were my only motivation, I'd have delegated these matters. Why would I personally involve myself?"

The air between them crackled as Nathaniel closed the remaining distance. His voice dropped to a rough whisper, "I don't love Isabella. Never have. The woman I care for is the mother of my child. Do you finally comprehend?"

His child's mother was...

Realization struck like lightning.

Evelyn's mind shattered.

###Chapter 382

At first, Evelyn didn't comprehend the weight of his words. Only after a delayed pause did the meaning sink in, leaving her speechless.

His fingers brushed against her cheek as he murmured, "Evelyn, tell me what's on your mind."

Her expression darkened. "I don't know."

"Don't know what?"

"How to respond to you."

Nathaniel's lips curved into a faint smile. His thumb traced the delicate curve of her cheekbone. "Is it really that complicated? Can't you even identify your own feelings about what I just said?"

"I can't put it into words right now."

He chuckled darkly, his piercing gaze demanding answers. "Evelyn, are you truly unable to describe your emotions, or do you simply refuse to believe me?"

She flinched.

His accusation hit its mark.

He was right. She didn't trust his sudden declaration because it defied all logic. After a year of failing to win his affection, this abrupt change seemed impossible.

Evelyn suspected it was only because of the baby. Had his feelings for her truly shifted?

Nathaniel watched the emotions flicker across her face with growing amusement. "It's fine if you don't believe me yet. You will in time. But first, I need to know what you're really thinking."

Her expression shifted subtly. She met his gaze, genuinely at a loss.

Throughout their marriage, his love had been her deepest longing. Had this happened before the divorce talks, she would have been overjoyed. Now, those desires felt like relics of the past.

Words failed her.

The silence stretched between them. Evelyn remained quiet for too long.

Nathaniel's face darkened visibly. The tension became unbearable.

Then his phone rang.

He pulled it out, glancing at the screen. Evelyn clearly saw Isabella's name flash across the display before their eyes met. "You should answer that," she said evenly.

She turned her attention to the window. Nathaniel studied her for a long moment before accepting the call.

"What do you want?" His voice held no warmth.

Isabella's fragile tone carried through. "Nathaniel, can you come now? I've remembered more details about the accident - I can describe the driver who hit us."

His expression turned icy. Without responding, he ended the call and turned back to Evelyn.

"I need to leave. Do you want to wait here or go home?"

Just one call from Isabella, and he was ready to drop everything.

Evelyn asked quietly, "You're going to see Isabella?"

"Yes. There are things I need to clarify."

"Is it really necessary?" Her voice was barely above a whisper.
###Chapter 383 

Nathaniel's gaze locked onto Evelyn with grave intensity. His stormy eyes conveyed what words couldn't - he had no choice but to leave.

Evelyn's lips curved into a tight, practiced smile. "Go then," she murmured.

A soft hum of acknowledgment escaped Nathaniel before he stood abruptly. His movements were precise as he retrieved his coat and strode toward the exit without hesitation. The door clicked shut with finality, the sound reverberating through Evelyn's chest like a physical blow.

He claimed not to love Isabella. Yet one call from her and he came running. That wasn't obligation. That was love.

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. She remained motionless in the empty office for what felt like hours before finally gathering herself to leave.

Samuel spotted her immediately. "Mrs. Martin, shall I arrange your car?" His tone was carefully neutral, following Nathaniel's explicit instructions.

Evelyn shook her head. "My driver's waiting." Her voice held none of its usual warmth.

Samuel escorted her to the elevator in silence, only returning to his desk after the doors slid shut.

Cassandra approached moments later, blueprints in hand. "Are they still in conference?"

"Both left separately," Samuel replied, accepting the documents.

Cassandra's brow furrowed. "Did Nathaniel say where he was going?"

"No idea." Samuel's clipped response ended the conversation.

Isabella had been immersed in concert preparations for weeks. Today's commercial shoot at the elite Meadowbrook Equestrian Club was just another commitment in her packed schedule.

Since signing with Martin Entertainment, her career had skyrocketed under Vanessa's expert management. The only shadow? Nathaniel's conspicuous absence. Even at corporate meetings, their paths never crossed - as if orchestrated.

When Nathaniel's car pulled up, Isabella was mid-shoot. Vanessa intercepted him immediately. "Mr. Martin! What a surprise. Should I interrupt-"

"Don't." Nathaniel's gaze remained fixed on Isabella in the distance. "Has her schedule been demanding?"

"Light actually. This was booked last week. Nothing until post-concert rehearsals."

Nathaniel merely nodded, his expression unreadable.

The shoot wrapped ten minutes later. Isabella spotted Nathaniel immediately, her face lighting up as she urged her horse forward. "Nathaniel!" Her exuberant call turned heads, though decorum kept onlookers from commenting.

In her excitement, Isabella accidentally spurred the horse. It reared violently, throwing her to the ground. The trainer barely restrained the panicked animal before its hooves could strike.

Gasps rippled through the crew. Isabella clutched her ankle, tears welling as she struggled to stand even with Vanessa's support. Each attempt sent fresh waves of pain across her features.

Her watery eyes found Nathaniel's. "Please," she whispered, extending trembling hands. "Help me up?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. His expression revealed nothing.
###Chapter 384 

The commercial shoot had drawn a massive crowd. Lingering would only attract more unwanted attention. Nathaniel had come to question Isabella about that incident from last year - he wasn't about to waste more time. After a brief hesitation, he strode toward her.

Isabella's eyes lit up with quiet triumph. She raised her arms expectantly, allowing him to sweep her up in a bridal carry. Her hands naturally looped around his neck.

The sudden proximity made Nathaniel's expression turn glacial, his gaze distant and unreadable.

A silent exchange passed between Isabella and Vanessa. The agent immediately understood, pulling out her phone.

Nathaniel carried her straight from the equestrian grounds to his car, with Vanessa and Emily trailing behind.

Inside the vehicle, Isabella gave Nathaniel an apologetic look. "Nathaniel, I'm so sorry for making you come all this way. And now you have to take me to the hospital..."

His face remained impassive. "Describe the person you remember." His tone brooked no argument.

"Now? Shouldn't we wait until after the examination?" Isabella suggested delicately.

Nathaniel fell silent.

Thirty minutes later at the hospital, Vanessa accompanied Isabella for her checkup while Nathaniel waited outside the examination room, lighting a cigarette.

Unbeknownst to him, paparazzi had captured his entire journey from carrying Isabella off the racecourse to arriving at the hospital. The photos exploded across social media.

The scandal trended instantly.

Everyone knew about Nathaniel and Isabella's past relationship. But Nathaniel was married to Evelyn now - a fact publicly confirmed by Martin Group's official accounts.

The tangled web between these three became instant tabloid fodder.

"Did Nathaniel and Evelyn divorce already?"

"Did the Martins cut ties with the Mitchells after their downfall?"

"Someone give us a statement!"

"Where's Isabella's PR team? Why the radio silence?"

"Is this a reconciliation after a secret divorce?"

"Bless your heart!"

Speculations ran wild with zero response from any involved parties.

The Martin family tried reaching Nathaniel after seeing the news but failed. They eventually contacted Samuel Yates to handle the crisis immediately.

Evelyn had seen the headlines too. So Nathaniel had rushed off for Isabella's sake.

That explained his urgency.

She scoffed bitterly. If he cared so much about Isabella, why bother with those misleading words to her? Just then, Beatrice called.

She demanded Evelyn contain the situation immediately.

Evelyn guessed it concerned the scandal but didn't hesitate, heading straight to the hospital.

Upon meeting, Beatrice fired questions:

"What's happening between Nathaniel and that girl? Everyone's saying you're divorcing! Is he going back to her? Tell me honestly Evelyn - is this because of me?"

"Grandmother, don't believe those rumors. They're just gossip with no truth to them. Nathaniel and I aren't divorcing, and this has nothing to do with you."

"Then why was he carrying her like that?"

Evelyn faltered, unsure how to explain.

Beatrice looked visibly distressed. Confined to the hospital in her old age, she hated being a burden - especially to Evelyn. The doubts gnawed at her.

Out of options, Evelyn finally reached for her phone. "I'll call him. You can ask him directly, alright?"

Beatrice nodded.

Evelyn dialed Nathaniel's number. The call connected but rang endlessly before disconnecting. She tried twice more with identical results.

Clutching her phone, Evelyn struggled to maintain composure before Beatrice. Finally, she admitted defeat. "He must be occupied. We'll try again later." She forced a reassuring smile.
###Chapter 385 

Beatrice sighed, her voice heavy with guilt. "Evelyn, this is all my fault. If I hadn't been such a burden, none of this would've happened. It must be because of me. I'm old. I don't need surgery. I've lived long enough."

"Grandma, this has nothing to do with you. Please, don't think like that."

But Beatrice couldn't shake the guilt, convinced she was the root of everything. Overwhelmed, her breathing grew uneven, forcing her to call for a nurse. After taking her medication, she stabilized—thankfully, nothing serious. Still, Evelyn felt a cold dread settle in her chest.

She leaned closer, voice soft but firm. "Don't say things like that again. No matter what, I won’t leave you. If you really don’t want to trouble me, then follow the doctor’s orders. I’m pregnant now. It would break my heart if you gave up." She kept talking, unsure if Beatrice was listening, but eventually, the protests stopped.

Evelyn stayed until Beatrice fell asleep, then quietly left.

Back in her car, her expression was ice. She told the driver to take her straight to the office.

Just hours ago, Nathaniel had whispered that he loved the mother of his child. Now, rumors about him and Isabella were everywhere.

It was almost funny.

She was glad she hadn’t answered him.

If she had let herself believe him, even for a second, she’d be humiliated beyond repair.

At the office, Charlotte was reviewing drafts with Gabrielle. Seeing Evelyn’s stormy expression, Charlotte dismissed the others to fix the issues she’d pointed out, then turned to her. "What’s wrong?"

Charlotte had been too buried in work to check the news.

Evelyn unlocked her phone, pulled up the trending headlines, and handed it over.

Charlotte’s eyes darkened. "What the hell is Nathaniel doing?"

"Do you think he loves Isabella?" Evelyn asked, tone flat.

Charlotte hesitated. "Why does that matter? Even if he does, you’re just going to let them walk all over you?"

"Why not? Some things aren’t meant to be mine."

"Evelyn, are you insane? Pregnancy hormones messing with your head?"

A bitter smile touched Evelyn’s lips, her gaze distant. Was she really okay with this?

She scoffed.

At the hospital, Isabella’s examination was done. Just a sprained ankle—nothing serious. A few days of rest would fix it.

Nathaniel had arranged a private room. With Vanessa and Emily handling the paperwork and gathering her things, they were left alone.

He studied Isabella on the bed. "Did you remember something?"

She hesitated, a flicker of something sly in her eyes before she masked it.

Biting her lip, she whispered, "The man who attacked us in the car... I remember his face now. He had a scar. Left cheek. Mid-forties..."

"Are you sure?"

"Positive. My therapist said the trauma blocked it. Maybe focusing on it helped me remember."

Nathaniel gave a slight nod, expression unreadable.

His fingers tightened around his phone, which showed missed calls from Evelyn. He frowned but dialed Samuel first.

"Find this man," he ordered. "Scar on the left cheek. Forties."

With a clear lead, the search would be easier.

###Chapter 386

Nathaniel gave a curt nod before adding, "Mr. Martin, you and Ms. Davis are currently trending online. The situation is escalating rapidly. Mr. Richard Martin requested I contact you immediately to handle this matter. What would you like our official response to be?"

Instead of answering, Nathaniel's gaze remained fixed on Isabella lying in the hospital bed. He raised his phone, continuing the call with Samuel while scrolling through the viral posts about him and Isabella.

The engagement metrics were staggering - over ten thousand shares and comments, with numbers climbing by the minute.

His eyes turned glacial, features hardening as he issued a terse command. "Get it taken down. Now."

"Understood, Mr. Martin," Samuel responded promptly. The PR team had already prepared multiple response drafts, but Nathaniel's ambiguous relationship with Isabella made approval difficult - sometimes distant, yet occasionally indulgent.

Phone still in hand, Nathaniel's dark eyes held a flicker of warmth as he addressed Isabella. "I need to return to the office. Rest well."

"Nathaniel, you're leaving already?" Isabella's voice carried a brittle cheerfulness that barely masked her disappointment.

His expression remained impassive, the chill in his demeanor almost imperceptible unless one studied the depths of his gaze. "The Martin Group is launching a new project with tight deadlines. Your injury isn't serious - Vanessa can stay with you."

Isabella lowered her head, voice barely above a whisper. "If I hadn't remembered that information, would you have even come to see me?"

Nathaniel maintained his stony silence.

Isabella's breathing hitched. "I know you and Evelyn are serious now. You've chosen her, especially since she's carrying your heir. What am I compared to that? If we have any connection left, it's only because of my involvement in last year's incident."

"Isabella." Nathaniel's voice cut like ice. "You prioritized your career over us. Are you having second thoughts now?"

"But you must realize," he continued, tone sharpening, "even with our contractual agreements, do you honestly believe I view you merely as a business associate? If any partner attempted to betray me, do you imagine they'd remain in my circle?"

The warning in his words was unmistakable. Isabella understood perfectly - he was cautioning her to quash today's scandalous rumors and never repeat such reckless actions. Her eyes narrowed into slits as she fell silent.

Nathaniel observed her dispassionately, the ghost of a smirk touching his lips. "Get some rest. I'm leaving."

"Fine." She nodded stiffly, watching him exit the hospital room with barely concealed venom in her gaze.

Their entanglement had lasted too long. Isabella refused to let go. She wanted Nathaniel permanently - not just Evelyn standing in her way, but all the insurmountable barriers keeping them apart.

If she couldn't have him, no one would. He was perfection incarnate, and only by destroying him could she ensure they'd fall together.

The darker her thoughts grew, the more sinister the glint in her eyes became.

Pursing her lips, she finally reached for her phone and dialed a familiar number.

When the line connected, her voice dripped with icy precision. "I delivered your message. But are you certain he'll believe it?"

###Chapter 387

The voice on the phone dripped with arrogant certainty. "He'll buy it. Desperation makes men predictable. Nathaniel's scrambling to uncover who's targeting him, who dares strike at the Martins. If this were an open war, he wouldn't flinch. But shadows terrify him more than bullets."

Isabella's knuckles whitened around her phone. Her gaze could freeze hell itself. "Handle the details. Just ensure he cuts all ties with Evelyn. The thought of them together makes me physically ill. That woman doesn't deserve his love."

"Control yourself, Isabella."

"Control?" A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "I've waited years while that architect slithered into my place. If words won't separate them, maybe losing their unborn child will."

The man's voice turned lethal. "Enough. First we manipulate Nathaniel into our trap. After that... do as you please."

Silence.

Isabella's mind raced with forbidden fantasies. The man forbade harming Evelyn, but rules never constrained her. Nathaniel belonged to her. Always had. Sometimes she imagined forgiving everything if he'd just kneel and beg. Fate owed her this happiness.

Nathaniel's car peeled away from the hospital. His thumb hovered over Evelyn's contact. Three rings. Five. No answer.

Just like when she'd called earlier.

His jaw clenched. The phone connected to the car speakers as he dialed her driver.

"Her location."

"At the office, sir."

The tires screeched.

Parking beneath her office building, Nathaniel scrolled through news feeds. The trending scandal about him and Isabella had vanished—scrubbed clean. But Evelyn had already seen it. She always saw everything.

The elevator doors slid open to her floor.

Evelyn hadn't ignored Nathaniel's call. Her phone lay buried under design sketches while she debriefed Charlotte.

Then Gregory appeared, holding a contract that made her blood run cold. "The Mitchell Group reached out again. Sophia personally requested you for their waterfront project."

Evelyn's pen snapped.

Gregory tread carefully. "We can decline if—"

"Is it profitable?" She interrupted.

"Very."

"Assign someone else." Evelyn stacked papers with military precision. "Between the competition and the Queens project, I'm stretched thin."

Gregory hesitated. "This isn't about... personal matters?"

A humorless smile. "Business stays business. My family drama won't bankrupt the firm."

The Mitchell Group's offer was a life raft—their only major project untouched by recent scandals. Because Evelyn had stalled approval, it remained pristine. Unbroken.

Unlike everything else.

###Chapter 388

The project required a partnership where the Mitchell Group's client had secured a newly constructed villa complex. The Mitchell Group would handle the interior design and landscaping, transforming bare structures into luxurious furnished villas that could sell for twice the price. Evelyn's firm, though primarily an architectural design company, had an exceptional reputation for high-end interior work.

It was the Mitchell Group's best option right now.

Gregory wasted no time contacting Sophia and negotiating a deal where the Mitchell Group would receive a three percent commission from the resale profits.

Once the agreement was finalized, Gregory turned to Evelyn. "I'll oversee this project. You don’t need to get involved unless absolutely necessary. But I’ll need your final approval on the designs—otherwise, I won’t feel confident." Evelyn gave a small smile. "Of course."

"Consider it my tuition fee."

"That might cost you quite a bit."

Gregory’s gaze intensified as he studied her. "I don’t care how much it costs, as long as you’re willing to teach me." Evelyn blinked, caught off guard, then looked away without responding.

Their eyes locked—Evelyn’s lips pressed together, her brows slightly furrowed. She and Gregory had been carefully maintaining distance, but lately, that only seemed to make things more complicated.

Especially when he looked at her like that—too direct, too knowing. It unsettled her.

A moment later, he spoke softly. "Evelyn, did you two have a fight?"

"No," she said, avoiding his eyes. "Why would you think that?"

His voice dropped lower, his stare unwavering. "If it wasn’t a fight, then why is he being so publicly affectionate with another woman? He’s married to you. Even if he doesn’t love you, he should at least keep up appearances. And now, with you carrying his child—isn’t he crossing the line?"

Crossing the line?

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh.

She didn’t know if it was excessive or not, but she did know one thing—if Isabella needed him, Nathaniel would drop everything for her. His mind would be so consumed by her that he wouldn’t even answer his phone.

The thought made her chest tighten.

She lowered her head, missing the calculating glint in Gregory’s eyes as she replied calmly, "Gregory, I appreciate you speaking up for me, but let’s not discuss this further. It could lead to misunderstandings."

"Misunderstandings?" His voice sharpened. "Evelyn, I don’t care if people misunderstand me. I just can’t stand seeing you treated this way."

She offered a faint smile. "I’m not upset. Really."

"Are you sure?"

"Positive. I just prefer not to talk about my personal life. Besides, the media tends to exaggerate things."

Even as she said it, no one knew what she truly felt.

Just as the tension between them thickened, a deep, icy voice cut through the air.

"Evelyn."

Both turned to see Nathaniel standing at the office door. He made no move to enter, just watched her with an unreadable expression. "Are you done? I came to pick you up. We’re visiting your grandmother today."

"Not yet. You can go ahead. I already saw her."

Her tone was distant, almost dismissive.

His expression darkened instantly, irritation flashing in his eyes.

Nathaniel’s voice turned dangerously quiet. "Is this how you want to talk to me—from across the room?"

###Chapter 389

Evelyn pressed her lips together, her voice steady as steel. "I'm in the middle of work. My firm might not rival the Martin Group, but I still have obligations. If you're in a hurry, you can leave without me."

Nathaniel's piercing gaze never wavered. A mocking smirk played on his lips. "You said it yourself—your company is nothing compared to mine. So you're coming with me."

The unspoken threat hung thick in the air.

Gregory caught the tension immediately. He stepped in, voice firm. "Mr. Martin, while we may not be on your level, everyone deserves respect for their work. Evelyn and I have a project to finalize. Dragging her away now would be highly unprofessional."

"Or what?" Nathaniel's eyes turned glacial. His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Do you honestly think you'd still be standing here if not for Evelyn?"

The implication was clear—without her, Gregory would have been forced out of Marseille long ago.

His words, though quiet, carried across the open office space. Every head turned. The air grew thick with tension.

Gregory's jaw clenched. He struggled to contain the fury rising in his chest.

Finally, he managed a weak response. "Intimidation isn't consent, Mr. Martin. Evelyn is your equal, not some subordinate you can order around."

Nathaniel barked out a laugh. "Spare me the noble act. At least I'm honest about my intentions. If you lack the spine to admit yours, then bury those pathetic fantasies for good. And don't waste your breath lecturing me about consent."

He dissected every word with surgical precision, leaving Gregory speechless.

The two men locked in a silent battle of wills. The power imbalance was painfully obvious.

After a tense standoff, Evelyn stood abruptly. If she didn't intervene, Nathaniel would only escalate. She refused to let others suffer because of her.

Without a word, she marched out of the office. Nathaniel followed close behind.

The car ride was suffocatingly silent.

Evelyn finally turned to him, eyes like ice. "Are you proud of yourself?"

"Stay away from him." Nathaniel's voice was rough, his grip tightening on the steering wheel. "I won't warn you again."

She let out a bitter laugh. "We were in a public office, surrounded by people. What exactly do you think could happen? Or have you forgotten I'm carrying your child?"

"Evelyn!"

"No need to shout. I hear you perfectly fine."

Her cold demeanor only fueled his anger. His expression darkened. "So you're ignoring me completely? Should I start making decisions for your company to get your attention?"

Her breath caught. "You wouldn't dare."

His smirk was chilling. "Try me. If I see you near him again, I'll make good on that promise."
###Chapter 390

"Fine, do whatever you want. I can't stop you anyway. If you can run to her the second she gets hurt, hold her close, and rush her to the hospital, then what can't you do?"

Nathaniel's brows drew together, his expression darkening as he replied in a low voice, "I didn't go because she was injured. I had questions for her. She fell after I arrived, and I never intended for it to become a scandal." He was trying to explain.

Evelyn's eyes narrowed slightly, her tone icy. "Nathaniel, you don’t owe me an explanation."

"If I don’t explain, will you believe me?"

"Whether I believe you or not doesn’t matter anymore. You know the truth better than I do. You always demand I stay away from Gregory. What about you?"

"You’re married too. Why can’t you keep your distance from Isabella? Sure, you can claim it was business, but that’s just an excuse. If you care so much about her reputation, why not just make it official?"

"Evelyn, I have no reason to lie to you. Haven’t you listened to anything I’ve said before?"

She stayed silent.

She was torn.

On one hand, Nathaniel swore he felt nothing for Isabella. On the other, every headline screamed otherwise.

Evelyn didn’t know whether to trust his words or the evidence flashing across every screen.

His patience wore thin. His voice dropped, rough and heavy. "Like you said—I could’ve given her a title. Then I wouldn’t need to explain myself to you. But Evelyn, I didn’t. Do you understand what that means?"

She lowered her gaze, her face unreadable.

She didn’t answer.

She didn’t know when she’d become like this—retreating into silence when upset, unaware of how much it hurt him.

Nathaniel tilted her chin up gently. "Evelyn. Answer me. Have you thought about what I said?"

Her lashes flickered. "I don’t want to think right now. My grandmother’s surgery is all that matters."

The mention of it silenced him.

His expression cooled instantly.

She didn’t want to talk. She didn’t want to give him an answer.

What was she hesitating over?

Because of Isabella?

Nathaniel’s gaze darkened, unreadable.

The conversation died there. He drove her back to the apartment in silence.

He’d thought about asking her to move back to Pineview Manor. But knowing her stubbornness, he didn’t push. As long as she was nearby, he could wait.

Rosalind had dinner ready when they arrived.

Lately, Charlotte had been joining them, but tonight it was just Evelyn and Nathaniel.

They ate without speaking, the only sounds the clink of silverware and quiet breaths.

Afterward, he asked softly, "Want to take a walk?"

"No. I’m tired."

"Then a movie?"

Her brows pinched slightly. "Don’t you have work?"

"Let me take one night off. Just to be with you."

His voice was deep, the last word rough with something unspoken.

She looked away.

He chose an old classic. They sat on the sofa, a careful space between them. He didn’t move closer—if she got upset, she’d leave. And when Evelyn shut down, she was capable of anything.
###Chapter 391 

The thought made Nathaniel's lips twitch with amusement as he studied Evelyn. Who would've guessed his usually composed wife could be so feisty? Just as the movie reached its most intense scene, Evelyn's phone buzzed loudly.

It was Caroline calling from the hospital.

Evelyn answered quickly while Nathaniel grabbed the remote to mute the film.

"Don't forget your prenatal appointment tomorrow," Caroline reminded. "I know how busy you've been, so I've been tracking your schedule."

"Got it, thanks."

"Bring Nathaniel if he's free. The Down syndrome screening might be uncomfortable."

"Will do."

Caroline advised fasting beforehand and packing snacks for afterward. Evelyn agreed and hung up.

She'd sat just far enough that Nathaniel couldn't hear the conversation.

When she set her phone down, he finally asked, "Everything alright?"

Evelyn hesitated. "Just routine stuff."

Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto her, but she met it steadily. Their silent standoff lasted several seconds before both looked away.

Though usually perceptive, Nathaniel couldn't tell if she was hiding something or if there truly was nothing to share. After the movie ended, Evelyn retreated to shower first.

By the time Nathaniel entered their bedroom, she was already in bed. They slept as usual, with him holding her close.

Morning came without incident, their bodies waking naturally. Evelyn rose first to shower, deliberately leaving her phone behind.

Nathaniel, not one to invade her privacy, called out but got no response. He reached for her phone just as another reminder notification lit up the screen.

His brow furrowed at the medical alert.

He answered the incoming call silently. "Are you on your way?" Caroline's voice came through. "Your appointment's in an hour. I've scheduled the Down syndrome screening first - it might be uncomfortable. Shouldn't Nathaniel come with you?"

"Is my wife having a prenatal exam today?" Nathaniel's deep voice startled Caroline into silence.

After a beat, she murmured confirmation.

Nathaniel set the phone down slowly, his expression unreadable. He remained seated on the bed, eyes glinting coldly until the bathroom door opened.

Evelyn froze under his icy stare. "What's wrong?" she asked after a tense moment.

"Where are you going?" His tone was dangerously calm.

Evelyn's sharp mind connected the dots instantly.

She chose honesty. "The hospital. For a prenatal checkup."

"Was that last night's call about this?" When she didn't deny it, Nathaniel's voice turned razor-sharp. "You're hiding medical appointments now? This child is mine too, Evelyn. Don't I have the right to know?"

"I wasn't hiding it," she countered. "I planned to tell you on the way."

Truthfully, she hadn't thought much of it. Between Nathaniel's packed schedule and the routine nature of the visit, handling it alone seemed logical.

###Chapter 392

Nathaniel didn't share her perspective. His eyes narrowed as he studied Evelyn, his voice dripping with icy displeasure. "So if I'm trapped in an obligation, that just happens to suit your plans perfectly, doesn't it?"

Evelyn met his gaze evenly. "If that's how you choose to interpret it, I can't change your mind."

Her casual response only deepened the frost between them.

The tension stretched as they stared each other down. Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line before she finally broke the silence. "If you're coming with me, then get ready now." She still had a construction site to visit after the appointment.

Nathaniel remained motionless.

Evelyn waited a beat, then turned toward the dressing room without another word.

When she emerged, he was waiting.

Since Evelyn wasn't eating breakfast, Nathaniel dismissed the idea as well. He waved off Rosalind, who was setting the table. "Cancel breakfast."

Rosalind nodded and retreated.

Evelyn glanced at him. "You don't have to skip it just because I am."

"Not hungry," Nathaniel clipped.

His anger was palpable, but Evelyn chose not to engage further.

At the hospital, Evelyn took charge. "Let's go straight to the doctor."

Everything had been prearranged—no lines, no waiting.

Nathaniel stayed by her side as they rode the elevator up.

The hospital buzzed with activity, people rushing in every direction. The moment the elevator doors opened, a man in scrubs barreled into Evelyn's shoulder.

"Watch where you're going!" he snapped.

Evelyn stumbled, nearly losing her balance.

Nathaniel's arm shot out, steadying her before she could fall. His glare was lethal. "You're the one who needs to watch where you're going."

His voice was sharp enough to freeze the air.

The man paled, immediately recognizing his mistake. "I—I'm sorry."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Apologize to her."

The man turned to Evelyn, stammering. "Miss, I didn't mean—"

"If apologies fixed everything, would you like me to shove you next?" Nathaniel's tone was dangerously calm.

Evelyn caught his arm. "It's fine. Let's just go. The doctor's waiting."

Nathaniel hesitated, but Evelyn's insistence won out. He kept her close, his grip firm as they walked to the examination room.

The check-up lasted nearly an hour.

Evelyn endured it with gritted teeth, nausea hitting her hard multiple times. Nathaniel watched, his jaw tight, emotions churning in his eyes.

When it was finally over, his voice was rough. "No more after this. One is enough."

He pressed a kiss to her temple, then pulled her into his arms, holding her like she was the only thing keeping him grounded.

###Chapter 393

Evelyn's head still felt foggy, struggling to process his words.

But the familiar warmth of Nathaniel's embrace and his distinct cedar scent grounded her. Slowly, comprehension dawned.

She remained silent, melting into his arms.

The doctor's report came back positive. The baby was perfectly healthy, eliminating all their earlier concerns.

While Nathaniel took a phone call outside, Dr. Harrison smiled knowingly at Evelyn. "Mr. Martin clearly adores you. He'll make an exceptional father and devoted husband."

As Caroline's mentor, the physician spoke with familial warmth.

Evelyn's cheeks flushed at his words.

Nathaniel's care was undeniable, yet it still felt like a dream.

She stepped out just as he finished his call. "Everything's fine," she assured him before he could ask.

"Good." His voice was velvet soft.

He pocketed his phone and took the report from her, their fingers brushing. Then his hand enveloped hers completely.

That simple contact sent warmth flooding through Evelyn's chest.

They reached the garage when Nathaniel finally spoke again. "Mother knows we came for the checkup. She wants to take you shopping. Interested?"

"Is Victoria here already?"

"On her way. So?"

Evelyn nodded. "We should go. It's been ages since we shopped together, and I'd never refuse her kindness."

His voice dropped an octave. "Just the two of you?"

"Wasn't that her invitation?" Evelyn blinked. "Does he want to come? But he has work..."

Victoria arrived swiftly, commandeering Evelyn for the backseat before they departed.

Nathaniel raised an eyebrow. "Making me the chauffeur now?"

"You should feel privileged, driving your wife, your mother, and your future child," Victoria countered effortlessly.

His lips quirked. "Indeed, my greatest honor."

Evelyn smiled, genuinely relaxed in Victoria's vibrant company.

The women's conversation flowed effortlessly from medical reports to nursery plans, completely engrossed in their world.

Thirty minutes later, they arrived at an upscale boutique.

Victoria squeezed Evelyn's hand. "I commissioned some maternity wear and baby clothes. They called last night - everything's ready for your approval."

"You shouldn't have gone through the trouble. The baby's so small still-"

"Nonsense. You're carrying Nathaniel's heir. I want you to be the most radiant expectant mother in the city."

The manager presented the custom designs immediately. Under Victoria's insistence, Evelyn tried on the elegant pieces - flowing fabrics that accentuated her curves while disguising her bump.

From behind, no one would guess she was pregnant.

With her natural glow and delicate features, Evelyn looked simply breathtaking.

###Chapter 394

Evelyn's face lit up with pure delight. "Absolutely stunning, darling," Victoria cooed, her eyes sparkling with admiration.

Nathaniel's mother kept showering her with compliments until Evelyn had to lower her gaze, cheeks warming under the praise.

Victoria suddenly turned to her son. "Nathaniel, don't you think Evelyn looks breathtaking today?"

Evelyn froze. Her eyes darted toward Nathaniel involuntarily.

He was already watching her with that intense gaze of his. When their eyes met, she quickly looked away, but not before hearing his deep voice rumble, "Exquisite."

"See? Even my son agrees," Victoria said triumphantly. "I wasn't exaggerating, was I?"

Evelyn's face burned hotter. She peeked at Nathaniel through her lashes, pressing her lips together to suppress a smile.

After collecting their purchases, Victoria whisked Evelyn off to more boutiques, with Nathaniel trailing behind like a dutiful pack mule, arms laden with shopping bags.

The morning passed in a whirlwind of retail therapy, followed by an elegant lunch at a bistro.

Evelyn noticed Nathaniel's subtle exhaustion. As they finished their meal, she gently suggested, "Victoria, I'm feeling rather tired. Perhaps I should head home to rest."

"Oh dear, I've worn you out!" Victoria exclaimed, immediately concerned. "Are you unwell?"

"Just a bit footsore. Some rest will do me good."

Victoria turned to Nathaniel. "Take Evelyn home, darling. I'll have the car fetch me."

"Wouldn't you prefer to come with us?" Evelyn offered.

"No need, dear. I'm meeting the ladies for bridge this afternoon. The driver can drop me directly."

Knowing Victoria's passion for card games, Evelyn didn't press further. They waited together for the car, then parted ways.

During the drive home, Evelyn broke the comfortable silence. "Is shopping more exhausting than board meetings?"

Nathaniel kept his eyes on the road, but his lips quirked. "Not particularly."

"Really?"

"Mm-hmm."

"But most men hate shopping, don't they?" Evelyn pressed, genuinely curious.

Nathaniel's grip tightened slightly on the wheel. "Other men?" His voice dropped an octave. "Who else have you gone shopping with?"

Evelyn's breath hitched. "No one," she said quickly. "Charlotte mentioned most men dislike shopping as much as women dislike fishing."

"Is that so?" Nathaniel's tone held quiet amusement.

His knowing look made her squirm. When he didn't press further, Evelyn gratefully changed the subject.

Back at the penthouse, Nathaniel helped carry her numerous purchases upstairs before preparing to leave for Martin Group headquarters.

Before he left, Evelyn mentioned, "Let's take Charlotte to dinner tonight. She's been so helpful with my project."

"Scarlett, then. You enjoy their cuisine," Nathaniel stated matter-of-factly.

Evelyn laughed. "We're treating Charlotte, not me."

"She's not my concern," Nathaniel replied smoothly, brushing his thumb along Evelyn's cheekbone. His voice softened. "If I'm delayed, go ahead without me."

"Drive safely," she murmured, watching him leave before closing the door, her skin still tingling where he'd touched her.

The moment Nathaniel stepped into the elevator, his phone buzzed with Samuel's call.

"Mr. Martin," Samuel reported, "the subject you asked about flew from Marseille to Dresden last week. Our team in Dresden is already investigating."

"I see." Nathaniel's voice gave nothing away.

Samuel hesitated. "There's... something else."

Nathaniel's tone remained even. "Continue."
###Chapter 395

"Mr. Martin, this feels off. Tracking someone like Isabella shouldn't be this straightforward, yet we've pinpointed a lead almost instantly."

Nathaniel slid into the driver's seat, his grip tight on the wheel while his other hand held his phone. His expression was unreadable, his voice detached. "Find her first. Everything else will fall into place."

"Understood." Samuel nodded.

Before hanging up, Nathaniel added abruptly, "Check with Isabella's therapist. Confirm if she's actually been attending her sessions."

He should've asked yesterday, but Evelyn's disappearance took priority. Now, he needed to know if Isabella had lied.

Samuel's earlier words had planted doubt in Nathaniel's mind.

Ending the call, Nathaniel accelerated toward Martin Group headquarters.

The Martin Group, in collaboration with Montgomery Enterprises, had secured a prime plot in Marseille's west district. The area had been dormant for years, but insider intel hinted at imminent development—government incentives included.

Their plan? A luxury mall flanked by corporate towers.

Everything was prepped, awaiting the results of the architectural competition before breaking ground.

Lately, Nathaniel had been locked in strategy sessions with Cassandra, ensuring maximum ROI.

When he strode into his office, Cassandra's glare greeted him.

She knew he'd taken Evelyn for her prenatal checkup. What she hadn't expected was for it to consume the entire morning.

"Nathaniel," she drawled, "once that baby arrives, will you start scheduling board meetings with a diaper bag? Maybe morph into one of those CEO dads who Zoom-calls with a newborn in a sling?"

A wry smile flickered across her lips, bitterness flashing and vanishing just as fast.

Like she'd told Evelyn, she'd made peace with her feelings. No disruptions. Just dignity.

Nathaniel considered her words, then smirked. "Absolutely."

Cassandra's eyes widened, but she said nothing, merely turning back to her work with a quiet exhale.

That evening, Evelyn and Charlotte arrived first at Scarlett, the upscale restaurant where Nathaniel had reserved a private room.

The maître d' led them inside. "Mrs. Martin, shall we serve now or wait?"

"Later," Evelyn said. "He isn't here yet."

With a nod, the maître d' left.

Charlotte flopped onto the plush sofa, eyeing Evelyn. "A formal dinner invite? Feels like I'm being buttered up for something."

"Consider it a thank-you for covering my workload."

"Will this gratitude come in cash or wire transfer?" Charlotte teased, reaching for her phone.

Evelyn tossed a velvet cushion at her.

"After this favor," Evelyn added, "next time I'll need you might be when I'm in labor."

Charlotte grinned. "Hand over the company keys when you go on leave. I'll make sure to loot everything."

"Looking forward to it," Evelyn deadpanned.

The door swung open. Nathaniel walked in, his presence immediately filling the room.

"Apologies for the delay."

"We just got here," Evelyn said.

"Shall we eat?" Nathaniel glanced at Charlotte, who shrugged.

"Sure."

As they settled at the table, servers began bringing out dishes.

Dresden cuisine was bold, all heavy spices and rich flavors. Marseille's was subtler, refined. Evelyn, raised in Dresden, shared Charlotte's preference for intensity—but pregnancy demanded restraint.

Nathaniel had ordered both: fiery curries for Charlotte, delicate seafood for Evelyn.

###Chapter 396

The lavish spread on the table made Charlotte Bennett raise an amused brow. "Mr. Martin, such hospitality is almost suspicious. Should I be worried you're buttering me up for something?"

Nathaniel Martin set down his coffee cup with practiced elegance, his gaze cool and assessing as it lingered on her.

Charlotte glanced at Evelyn beside her, half-expecting an explanation. "Aren’t you going to ask what he’s plotting?"

Evelyn merely smiled. "He’s talking to you, not me."

Frowning, Charlotte turned back to Nathaniel. "Out with it, then. But I won’t agree to anything shady."

A faint smirk curved his lips before he got to the point. "The Martin Group has a new venture launching after the competition. I want the Prescott Group as our partner."

"Prescott?" Charlotte blinked. "We’ve only just dipped into real estate—mostly hotels."

"Exactly. I need your marketing expertise to elevate this project. In return, Prescott gains a foothold in Martin’s established real estate empire. Mutual benefit."

His tone left no room for jokes. Evelyn caught the shift, turning to him. "You want Charlotte to convince Alexander?"

"Not just convince." Nathaniel’s eyes gleamed. "If Prescott agrees, your design studio could contribute. A chance to expand your reputation."

Charlotte hesitated, her gaze flicking to Evelyn again.

Nathaniel noticed but dismissed it as her seeking Evelyn’s opinion.

After a beat, Charlotte sighed. "I’ll mention it to Alexander. But that’s all."

"I’m sure your word carries weight," Nathaniel said, his knowing look making her tense.

Evelyn smoothly redirected. "If this moves forward, can I join?"

"You want in?"

"Obviously. With Prescott involved, this will be huge. My firm could use the exposure."

Nathaniel chuckled. "You’re in. But I’ll have to negotiate with Gregory. Fair?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes just as the door swung open.

"Nathaniel, ditching me for lunch? Rude."

Thomas Ellsworth’s voice filled the room—until he froze at the sight of the trio. His fiancée, Penelope Fairchild, clung to his arm, her smile sharpening as she took in the scene.

Five pairs of eyes met. The air thickened with unspoken tension.

Thomas cleared his throat. "Didn’t realize you had company. We’ll go."

But Penelope tightened her grip. "Why leave? It’s been ages since you and Nathaniel caught up."

Her sugary tone dripped with challenge. Evelyn’s glare could’ve iced the room, but Penelope didn’t flinch.

The standoff crackled, unresolved.

###Chapter 397

Nathaniel's voice remained steady as he asked, "Thomas, will you be joining us for dinner?"

"Not necessary. Her invitation means nothing." Thomas narrowed his eyes, shooting Penelope an icy glare. "Do you actually believe you're welcome here?"

He had no intention of doing Penelope any favors.

Penelope's face froze into an uncomfortable mask before she dropped her gaze in silence.

Turning back to Nathaniel, Thomas announced, "I'll take my leave now."

"Very well," Nathaniel murmured in response.

Thomas strode out first, with Penelope scrambling after him like an obedient shadow.

An oppressive silence settled over the dining room. Evelyn found her gaze drawn to Charlotte beside her. The woman was eating with apparent nonchalance, only to flash a bright smile when she noticed Evelyn watching. "Why the staring? Eat your food. I'm perfectly fine."

Evelyn's expression darkened with concern despite Charlotte's cheerful facade.

Nathaniel offered quietly, "I didn't invite him."

"Does it matter? Should I start avoiding Marseille just because he exists?" Charlotte's tone was light, but Evelyn knew better. The more her friend pretended indifference, the deeper the hurt ran.

What had begun as a pleasant evening had soured the moment Thomas and Penelope made their unwelcome appearance.

During the drive home, Charlotte kept up a steady stream of chatter, practically wearing a neon sign that screamed "I'M FINE" for Evelyn's benefit.

When they reached Beatrice's apartment where Charlotte was staying, Evelyn hesitated. "Let me stay with you tonight."

Charlotte saw right through her. "Con, seriously, I'm okay. I'm not some fragile doll. That's all ancient history now. We've got to move forward, right? Just tired tonight - big day at work tomorrow for your project, remember?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, worry lines creasing her forehead. "Call me. For anything."

"Got it."

With a quick nod, Charlotte disappeared through the door under Evelyn's watchful gaze.

The moment the door clicked shut, Charlotte's cheerful mask crumbled. Her carefully maintained smile vanished, replaced by an expression of cold emptiness.

She'd fooled herself into believing she'd erased him completely. But tonight proved that absence only meant no one spoke his name - not that he'd truly left her heart or mind.

Back at their apartment, Evelyn's concern lingered. "Do you think Charlotte's really alright?"

"Would you like to go check on her?" Nathaniel asked softly.

Evelyn shook her head. Some wounds needed space to heal.

Still, curiosity gnawed at her. "How did Thomas know we'd be at Scarlett tonight? Has he been having Charlotte followed?"

"Unlikely. Probably overheard from staff. Thought it polite to say hello since it was just the two of us."

"Bringing Penelope along was polite?" Evelyn's protective instincts flared, her dislike for Penelope evident.

Nathaniel simply pulled her close, murmuring against her hair, "Shall I remind him to leave his fiancée at home next time?"

Evelyn didn't respond, but her silence spoke volumes.

Best friends stuck together, after all.

That night, sleep eluded Charlotte. Tossing restlessly, she finally abandoned the pretense and poured herself drink after drink by the floor-to-ceiling windows.

She'd hoped alcohol would bring oblivion, but it only sharpened her awareness, leaving her painfully sober in her misery.

By 3 AM, an ambulance rushed Charlotte to the hospital for alcohol poisoning.

Through the long night of tests and treatments, as dawn's first light crept through the hospital windows, Evelyn and Nathaniel waited in exhausted silence on the stiff waiting room couch.

Nathaniel gently pulled Evelyn against him. "Rest your eyes. I'll wake you when she's conscious."

Evelyn shook her head stubbornly. "I'm not tired."
