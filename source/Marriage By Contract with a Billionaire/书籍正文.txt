###Chapter 1

Alexander Kane. New York City's youngest billionaire and one of its most coveted bachelors, sat in the back of his bespoke Rolls-Royce Phantom.his hand impatiently tapping against the plush armrest. His eyes flicked at the watch on his wrist, the gleaming face reflecting the orange glow of the evening sky as the vehicle inched forward in the gridlocked traffic.


It was already 7 p.m., and he had just left the office-his mind on a far more pressing matter than the workday's end. Today was his birthday.but the thought of celebrating felt as foreign to him as a life of mediocrity.What truly weighed on him was his destination: the old family estate,where his late grandfather, Lord Benjamin Kane, WILL,would be about to be read.


Alexander's relationship with the man was complicated-part mentor,part tyrant-but respect was non-negotiable. Though his grandfather's empire had never been the driving force behind Alexander's success. the old man's teachings had shaped him into the cold,calculating business titan he had become. He owed his rise to his abilities, but even now, at 30. Alexander could feel the weight of his grandfather's expectations pressing on him from beyond the grave. As the Rolls-Royce finally navigated the congested streets and made its way up to the mansion, Alexander's mind wandered back to memories of his grandfather-the stern lessons, the ruthless power plays,and the unyielding grip the old man had over the family and business. The Kane name, once synonymous with absolute power, still loomed large, despite his passing five months ago. When the car came to a halt, his assistant, James Parker, hurried to open the door. "Quite the turnout," Alexander remarked, his voice laced with curiosity as he took in the sight of several expensive vehicles lining the driveway. His gaze narrowed.

"Is there a party I wasn't informed about?"

James hesitated, his expression uneasy. "Young master... it's a birthday celebration. Your grandmother organized it for you."


Alexander's brow furrowed. “A birthday party?" The words were spoken with an air of disbelief, his gaze turning colder.

James swallowed hard. "Yes, sir. She insisted."

"And you knew about this... and didn't tell me?"


James shifted uncomfortably, caught between loyalty to his boss and the pressure of his grandmother's wishes. "Forgive me, sir. I was instructed not to say anything."

A moment of silence passed before Alexander's voice, calm yet edged with menace, cut through the tension. "No bonuses for the next six months."


James winced, his thoughts racing. The wrath of Alexander Kane was not something easily escaped.


Inside the mansion, the sounds of cheerful greetings hit him like a tidal wave.“Happy Birthday!" rang out from all directions. Alexander's expression soured further as he spotted his grandmother, who embraced him with a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. "I didn't ask for this,Grandma." She laughed softly, though there was a touch of sadness in it.′′Iknow,darling. But it's your 30th. You've never celebrated before." His gaze swept over the room, and he couldn't miss the obvious-his grandmother had invited every eligible woman in New York's high society.hoping to find him a match. His lips twisted into a wry smile. He wasn't naive; this was part of her endless campaign to secure his future-according to her,anyway.

"Where's the lawyer?" he demanded, not even bothering to acknowledge the women fluttering around him like moths to a flame.


Grandma Helen raised an eyebrow but gestured toward the stairs. "Let's have a drink first. The lawyer will meet us upstairs."

"I'll head up now." Alexander said, his tone dismissive.

As he turned to climb the stairs, a woman barreled toward him, her outfit garish,her perfume overbearing. She tried to get close, but the security guards swiftly blocked her path.

"Mr. Kane, just a moment-let me introduce myself. I'm sure you'll-"


"Escort her out," Alexander ordered, his voice cold. “And make sure she doesn't return."

The woman's protests were drowned out by the sounds of the guards'firm response. Alexander didn't even glance back as he ascended to the second floor.

Two hours later, the party had dwindled to nothing more than a distant memory. The last of the guests had gone, leaving only Grandma Helen,who marched upstairs, fury barely contained beneath her graceful exterior.

"Alexander," she began, her voice sharp, "you've made your point. Can we at least get this over with?" Alexander sat at a long table, the family lawyer, Mr. Edwards, beside him.His grandmother, her lips tight with frustration, took her seat. The rest of the household staff lingered quietly in the room, their presence a silent reminder of their loyalty to the family name. The lawyer adjusted his glasses and cleared his throat. "According to the will,"' he began, his eyes scanning the paper in front of him, "Alexander receives 50% of the estate, 20% from his absent sister, 20% from Grandma Helen, and the remaining 10% from the staff. This includes Kane Enterprises and various other properties."

A pause. Everyone in the room waited for the next part, sensing there was more.


"But." Mr. Edwards hesitated, glancing at Alexander, who had not flinched since he entered the room. "There is a condition."


Alexander leaned forward, his gaze icy. "A condition?"

"Yes," the lawyer replied, his voice dropping. "To inherit the full estate,including Kane Enterprises, Alexander must marry... and have a child within one year and six months. If he fails to do so, the entire inheritance will be donated to orphanages in New York City."

The room fell silent. Grandma Helen's face drained of color. She had known her grandson's stance on marriage and had tried countless times to get him to relent, but this... this was beyond anything she had expected.

Alexander's expression remained unreadable, his voice even as he addressed the lawyer. "So, you're telling me... if I don't marry and have a child within 18 months,everything goes to the orphans?"


The lawyer nodded, his eyes glinting with uncertainty.


Alexander's gaze shifted to his grandmother, who was now fighting to hold back tears. He wasn't surprised; the old man had always pushed for this, but now, it seemed his death would be the final nail in Alexander's coffin.


His voice broke the silence, sharp and commanding. "Get out," he ordered the others. The butler and staff exited immediately.leaving only the lawyer and Grandma Helen in the room.

Once the door was shut behind them. Alexander turned to the lawyer wvith a cold smile. "And if I don't comply, what happens to the Kane legacy?"

Mr. Edwards shifted uncomfortably, unsure how to respond.

“I guess we'll see," Alexander murmured, his eyes narrowing with a dangerous gleam. “But I wonder... will I be the one to choose my fate,or will my grandfather have the final word?"

The lawyer could only stare at him, his face paling as the weight of Alexander's words hung heavy in the air.
###Chapter 2

The room seemed to hold its breath.

"Yes, Mr. Kane," Mr. Edward confirmed, his tone grave."That is exactly what the will stipulates."

The words hung heavy in the air, each syllable amplifying the silence that followed. Grandma Helen's sobs broke through the stillness, her frail hands trembling as she clutched the table for support. "Alexander, please.You must do this. Your grandfather's legacy... it cannot just vanish like that.”


Alexander's jaw tightened, his teeth grinding together. The suffocating weight of duty pressed down on his chest, but his frustration burned hotter."I understand, Grandma. But marriage? A child? In that timeframe?”


"Think about what your grandfather built, Alexander." Grandma Helen's voice cracked, but her gaze held firm. "This isn't just about money-it was his life's work, his dream. It's our family's foundation. You owe it to him... to all of us."

Alexander turned away, running a hand through his dark hair. The enormity of the situation bore down on him, but he refused to crumble beneath it. After a long pause, he muttered, "I need time to think." Mr. Edwards cleared his throat, his voice measured. “You don't have much time, Mr. Kane. The clock is already ticking." Alexander exhaled sharply. "Then let it tick. Let the inheritance go.Donate it to the orphans. As if I care." Grandma Helen gasped, her face pale with shock. "Alexander! You cannot be  serious. This is your grandfather's legacy. His life." "I know. Grandma," he replied coolly, his tone sharper now.“But I won't be coerced into a life I don't want. Not for money,not for legacy... not for anything."

Her sobs deepened, but Alexander didIn't falter. He turned away, his voice lowering. "I'll think about it. But on my terms-not his, not yours."

Grandma Helen's tears streaked down her cheeks as she whispered, “Just don't let it all go to waste, Alexander. Don't let his spirit disappear like that.Please."

Alexander's resolve flickered briefly as he caught the desperation in her voice. But the fire of past betrayals burned within him, hardening his heart.
"I'll figure it out," he said flatly, then strode out of the room without another word.



**********


That evening, Alexander sat alone in his sprawling study, a glass of whiskey in his hand. The fire in the hearth flickered, casting long shadows that seemed to mirror the chaos in his mind.

He stared at the amber liquid, his thoughts returning to the ghosts of his past-the people who had shaped him, for better or worse. Chief among them was Ariana.


Ariana. The name tasted bitter on his tongue. She had been his first great love,a fiery whirlwind who had swept into his life during his college years. She was brilliant, ambitious, and charming-a woman who seemed to match his every move. With Ariana, he had dared to dream of a future,one filled with love, a home, and even the possibility of children. But just as he had begun planning their life together, everything fell apart.On the night of their anniversary, Alexander had gone out of his way to surprise her. He had left a multi-million-dollar deal hanging in the balance to show up at her office with flowers and take her to the city's most exclusive rooftop restaurant. It had been raining that night, and he'd arrived soaked but beaming, excited to see her face when he revealed his plans.

Instead, he found her in another man's arms.


The memory was vivid-the way the rain blurred the edges of the scene,but not the betrayal etched on her face. Ariana hadn't even tried to deny it.Her explanation had been cold, cutting: “I needed more, Alex. You're good for power and status, but love? That's not you."

The words had destroyed him. But worse still was what came later-when he learned she had leaked their company's business strategies, which almost led to the company's bankruptcy.


It was then that Alexander vowed never to let himself be vulnerable again.Love was a weakness, and he refused to be played the fool a second time.

Yet,despite his resolve, life had a cruel way of repeating itself. Years later.he had given love another trial, hoping that perhaps someone could mend what Ariana had broken. But history repeated itself, and the betrayal cut even deeper.

This time, it had been Elena, a poised and refined woman who seemed different from Ariana. She had been everything he thought he needed:supportive, understanding, and seemingly genuine. For a time, Alexander believed he could build something real with her. He had let his guard down and allowed himself to hope. Then, one day, Elena revealed she was pregnant. But just as his heart dared to feeI joy, the truth came crashing down-the child wasn't his. Elena had been seeing another man the entire time, using Alexander as a convenient shield for her affair. The pain of that betrayal had solidified Alexander's belief: love was a cruel illusion.


Now, as he sat in his study, the idea of marriage and a child felt like a sick joke. Could he truly trust anyone again? Was it even possible to find someone who wouldn't see him as a mere stepping stone?

The door creaked open, interrupting his thoughts. James,his ever-loyal assistant, entered cautiously, his face a mix of hesitation and determination.

"Sir, if I may... I have an idea," James began, his voice steady but unsure of Alexander's mood.


Alexander looked up, the flicker of the fire reflecting in his cold eyes.“Speak."


James took a breath.“What if... instead of pursuing a traditional marriage,you arranged a marriage of convenience? Someone who understands the terms-no emotions, no illusions. Just a contract to fulfill your grandfather's will.”


Alexander's brow arched, the idea intriguing him. “You're suggesting I buy a wife? A name partner only?”


“Exactly,"James replied, emboldened by Alexander's interest.“It doesn't have to be romantic. It's just an agreement. That way, you can meet the terms of the will without risking... personal entanglements." Alexander leaned back in his chair, a cold smile tugging at his lips.“A marriage of convenience," he murmured, the idea taking root in his mind.It was clean, pragmatic, and-most importantly-safe. He stood abruptly, towering over James as his shadow loomed across the room.“Fine. You have 48 hours to find a suitable candidate. Someone who understands the deal. If you fail..." He let the threat hang in the air,his gaze cutting into James.
James swallowed hard but nodded. "Understood, sir."

As James left the room. Alexander turned back to the fire, the flames reflecting the sharp edge of his resolve.


A marriage of convenience.

It was a calculated move, devoid of emotion.

And yet, as the firelight flickered across his face, Alexander couldn't shake the lingering thought: could even a contract marriage truly shield him from the pain of betrayal?


The past had taught him one lesson-trusting the wrong person could cost him everything.


This time, there could be no mistakes.

And if there were... the consequences would be unimaginable.
###Chapter 3

As James exited Alexander's study, the weight of his words pressed heavily on his chest. Alexander's voice echoed in his mind, sharp and unforgiving.

"Your time begins now, James. If I were you, I'd be out of here already.I'd hate to see you lose your job because you hesitated."

James barely registered the door closing behind him with a heavy,resounding click. The task ahead seemed impossible-a 48-hour deadline to find a woman who could meet the exacting standards of Alexander Kane. The clock was already ticking, the seconds slipping away like sand through his fingers, and failure was unthinkable.

His heart raced as he stepped into the bustling office. It was like stepping into a different world-one where everything moved too fast, too relentlessly. He barely heard the chatter of colleagues or the ringing of phones. His mind was consumed by the pressure to deliver. How could he possibly find someone worthy enough for a marriage of convenience with a billionaire like Alexander? His mind was clouded with the realization that no one would willingly agree to such an arrangement unless there was something more. But what? What did she have to offer that would make her stand out? The next 24 hours became a blur of interviews, each woman mnore desperate than the last, alI eager to marry a man like Alexander Kane. Yet,none of them measured up to the cold, calculating expectations he knew his boss required. Frustration gnawed at James, his confidence eroding with each rejection. Time was slipping through his fingers, and with it, his hope of meeting Alexander's demands. Meanwhile, Alexander sat alone in his study, the silence thick with tension. His eyes remained fixed on the clock, the sound of its ticking louder than ever. He wasn't just considering the business implications of the arrangement; this could change the entire course of his life, for better or worse. The idea of entering into a cold, emotionless marriage felt like walking on a razor's edge. But his grandfather's will loomed over him like a shadow, pushing him toward a decision he wasn't sure he was ready to make.


When James finally returned to the study, the exhaustion on his face was unmistakable. He looked drained like he had aged years in a single day.His eyes were bloodshot, his shoulders slumped in defeat. Yet, there was something eIse in his expression-a flicker of hope.

Alexander didn't look up immediately. He continued to stare at the pile of documents on his desk, the heavy silence stretching between them.“You realize you only have 24 hours left," he said, his voice a mere whisper,but sharp enough to cut through the tension.“Standing here isn't going to help you.”


James swallowed hard, his throat dry. He could feel the beads of sweat on his forehead, despite the cool air in the room. "I've found someone, sir.She's...different from the others."

“Different?” Alexander's voice was laced with doubt, his gaze finaly lifting from the papers.“How?”

James hesitated for a moment before handing over the profile, his hand trembling slightly. “Her name is Lily Evans. She doesn't come from money,but there's something about her-an honesty, a strength. She might be what you're looking for."

Alexander took the profile, his sharp eyes scanning the document with ruthless precision. He was silent for along moment, the room still exceptfor the sound of rustling paper. Fially, he looked up, his gaze piercing.“Bring herin."
*************
Lily Evans stepped into the study, her heart hammering in her chest.She had imagined this moment countless times, but now that it was here,everything felt overwhelming. The opulence of the mansion, the weight of Alexander's presence-it was all too much. But she had come this far,and there was no turning back now.


She forced herself to remain composed, to mask the whirlwind of emotions inside her. This was her chance-a shot at changing her life forever. She wasn't here for the money alone, not really. She had quietly admired Alexander for years, following his career with a fascination that bordered on obsession. But now, none of that could show on her face. She had to be calm and professional. Nothing more.

Alexander's gaze flicked up as she entered, and for a moment, she swore she saw something like curiosity flash across his eyes. “Ms. Evans,” he said.his voice cold and commanding. “Please, have a seat.”

Lily nodded politely and settled into the chair opposite him, her hands folded neatly in her lap, though her palms were slick with sweat.“Thank you for seeing me,Mr.Kane." He studied her in silence, his eyes never leaving her face, as if searching for some hidden truth she wasn't willing to reveal. “You understand the nature of this arrangement?" he asked, his voice low and calculating. Lily met his gaze without flinching. "I do, Mr. Kane. I undderstand this is a marriage of convenience, not a traditional one. I'm prepared to fulfill my role without any misconceptions." Alexander leaned back in his chair, his fingers tapping rhythmically against the desk. "Why would you want to enter into such an agreement?What do you hope to gain from this?"

Lily took a deep breath, trying to steady the whirlwind of thoughts racing in her mind. "I've been struggling to make ends meet. This arrangement offers me financial stability, and I believe I can fulfill the responsibilities required. More than that, I'm not looking for love or emotional attachment.
I'm here because I want a better life."

Her words were measured, but inside, her heart was pounding. She had been silently captivated by him for so long, yet now she had to bury those feelings deep down. This was about survival, not romance.

Alexander's eyes narrowed slightly as if sensing there was more to her story, but he didn't press further. "This will be a legally binding agreement,Ms. Evans. No romance. Just a mutual commitment to fulfill the terms."

"Yes, Mr. Kane," she responded firmly. “I understand completely. I'm prepared for that."

Alexander studied her for another long moment, his expression unreadable.
Finally, he nodded. "Very well. If you're ready to proceed, we can move forward. I'll have the legal documents drawn up, and we'll begin the process of registering the marriage."


Lily's heart skipped a beat, but she forced herself to remain calm. “Thank you, Mr. Kane. I'm ready to proceed.” With that, Alexander signaled the end of the conversation. James stepped forward to take over, relief written on his face as he handled the arrangements. But as Lily left the study, her mind was a storm of conflicting emotions.She had secured what she wanted, but now... now the reality of what she had agreed to was starting to settle in. She had entered into this for security, for a chance at a new life-but she couldn't help but wonder:Why did Alexander choose her?


And deeper still: Would she regret this?

As Lily closed the door behind her, she was left with an unsettling thought.The futuare she had fought for had just begun, but it wasn't the future she had expected. And with every step she took away from that door, she couldn't shake the feeling that something far more dangerous was waiting for her.
###Chapter 4

Alexander leaned back in his leather chair, the heavy mahogany desk between them feeling like a vast divide. He slid a sleek, silver pen across the polished surface toward Lily.

"The terms are simple," he said, his voice as cold and professional as if he were negotiating a multi-billion dollar merger. "You will be my wife in name, and you will fulfill the requirements of my grandfather's will. Specifically, the clause regarding the continuation of the Kane legacy."

Lily looked down at the document. Her eyes scanned the words 'Securing the Inheritance' and 'Legal Heir Requirements'. It wasn't just a marriage; it was a strategic alliance built on the foundation of a legacy she barely understood.

"You mean... a child," Lily whispered, her voice trembling slightly.

"I mean an heir," Alexander corrected, his expression unreadable. "The will is ironclad. To retain control of the Kane empire, there must be a clear line of succession. According to the contract, our union will last for eighteen months. During this time, we will maintain the appearance of a devoted couple. We will reside in the same house, attend all family functions together, and work toward meeting the inheritance criteria."

He paused, his sharp eyes locking onto hers. "In exchange, you will receive the protection of the Kane name and the financial resources you need to settle your... personal debts. Once the requirements are met and the time is up, we will dissolve the marriage quietly. You will be free, and you will be wealthy beyond your imagination."

Lily felt a chill run down her spine. It was a cold, calculated arrangement. No love, no passion—just business. But as she thought of her sisters and the enemies closing in on her, she realized she had no other choice.

"And my personal life?" she asked, her voice gaining a bit of strength.

"As long as you do not bring scandal to the Kane name, I do not care what you do," Alexander replied dismissively. "We are partners in a contract, nothing more. Do we have an agreement?"

Lily picked up the pen. The weight of it felt like lead in her hand. She thought of the slums she had left behind and the justice she still needed to find. With a steady hand, she signed her name at the bottom of the parchment.

"We have an agreement," she said, her voice firm.

Alexander nodded, a look of grim satisfaction crossing his face. "Welcome to the family, Lily. Let’s hope you’re as resilient as you look."
###Chapter 5

Grandma Helen stood on the grand terrace of the old Kane estate, her sharp eyes taking in the serene view of the garden that had witnessed generations of family history. A faint sigh escaped her lips, betraying the mix of relief and disappointment swirling within her. Relieved that her grandson hadn't been foolish enough to squander the Kane legacy on mere strangers, disappointed that he'd resorted to marrying under such dubious circumstances. 

Her wrinkled hands gripped the arms of her chair as she called out sharply, "Camila!"

"Yes, Ma'am?" Camila, the loyal servant who had been with the Kane family for decades, appeared immediately at her side, ever attentive. 

"My grandson has married a girl," Helen said, her voice laced with a bitter edge of resignation. "Even if she may not be the most fitting choice, I still feel it's only right to meet her. To understand who she is... to see what kind of woman has joined our family." 

Camila paused, considering the request. She knew Grandma Helen's bluntness could be overwhelming, but there was no denying that Helen's intentions, however harsh, were always rooted in concern. After a brief moment, she nodded. "That is a good idea, Grandma." 

"Then fetch me my phone," Helen commanded, her voice steady and decisive. Camila handed over the phone without a word, and Helen dialed Alexander's number with practiced ease. It rang several times, and then the call was answered—but there was only silence at the other end. "Hello, Grandma," Alexander's voice finally broke through, cold and distant, as if he had been expecting her call but dreading it nonetheless. 

"Why the silence?" Helen's sharp tone cut through the air. "If you're not going to speak, then don't bother picking up the phone, you rascal." 

After a moment's pause, Alexander's voice was sharper, though tinged with a hint of weariness. “What is it, Grandma?" 

Helen wasted no time. "How could you rush into marriage like this, without even considering the candidates I gave you last year? You know what I mean, Alexander. There were better choices." 

Camila, standing in the background, couldn't help but shake her head in silent sympathy. She understood Helen's love for her grandson, but her bluntness often did more harm than good. 

"Alexander," Helen continued, her voice softening with a mix of sweetness and steel, "I'm relieved you've finally settled down, but you could've done better. Even though I'm disappointed, I understand why you did it. I miss you, my boy." 

For a moment, there was a heavy silence at the other end. Then, Alexander's voice, quieter now, spoke, "I miss you too, Grandma. I know we haven't seen each other yet, but I did what I had to do." 

Helen felt the pang of regret stab at her heart. She wasn't giving up yet. “That's why I want to meet your wife, Lily. I want to understand the woman who's joined our family, even if it's just for dinner." Alexander's frustration crackled through the phone. "Grandma, there's no need. This marriage—it'll end in a year and a half, okay?" 

“What?” Helen's voice rose in shock, her dismay evident. "So, you're telling me you plan to divorce her after that?" 

Alexander raked a hand through his hair, his irritation flaring. "I'm busy, Grandma. I have to go." 

"But I—" Helen started, but the line went dead before she could finish. 

"That stubborn boy," she muttered under her breath, eyes narrowing as a surge of determination took hold of her. She turned to Camila, her mind already made up. 

Camila's heart sank as she saw the fire in Helen's gaze. "You're thinking of going there yourself, aren't you?" 

Helen's lips curved into a steely smile. "Since he won't bring her here, I'll go to them. I'm sure she'll be there." 

Camila hesitated for a moment but then nodded decisively. “A good idea. I'll prepare the car." 

Helen stood with a decisive air and walked inside to ready herself for an unexpected but necessary journey. 

Meanwhile, in Alexander's mansion, Lily sat in the sitting room, half-heartedly watching a movie. Her eyes glazed over as a scene triggered a flood of memories, ones she desperately wished to forget but could never erase. The laughter and chaos of the movie faded, and she was left alone with her thoughts. 

She remembered leaving her father's home to start a new life in one of Aurora City's poorest neighborhoods. The slums had become her refuge, a place to hide her true identity, and a place to search for justice for the tragic deaths of her twin sisters. 

Eight months ago, everything had changed. Lily had lost her sisters to the greed and cruelty of her stepmother and stepsister—women who were willing to kill for the fortune left in their family's will. In the wake of their deaths, Lily had escaped with nothing but a heart full of grief and rage. Her name—the heir to the Emerson empire—was the reason her sisters were dead, and now she alone carried the weight of their family legacy. 

She couldn't stop the memories from rushing back. Her ex-boyfriend, a man she had once trusted, had orchestrated the darkest moment of her life. He and his companion had subjected her to a brutal attack, a shadow of betrayal and malice that left her shattered. In the agonizing aftermath, the trauma had claimed more than just her peace; she had lost her only beacon of hope—the child she was carrying. Her heart broke all over again, the unbearable grief of that physical and emotional wreckage threatening to consume her. 

Lily's gaze hardened as she thought of her father. His infidelity had brought the malicious stepmother into their lives—his choices had led to the tragedy that had taken everything from her. She remembered her late mother's warnings, how her grandfather had begged her mother not to marry him. She wished her mother had listened. 

After her death, everything was left to Lily and her twin sisters. But now, she was the only one left to carry the burden. The knowledge that she was the last surviving heir, forced to face the peril of her family's inheritance alone, haunted her. As Lily sat there, her thoughts swirled in chaos. If Alexander ever found out about her past—about the darkness she had endured, the loss of her sisters, and the deep scars on her soul—he would never look at her the same way again. He would see her as a gold-digger, a woman who had used her tragic past to manipulate him into marriage. And the idea of him calling her a "bitch," as he coldly rejected her, made her shudder with dread. The fear of being exposed, of having everything she had worked for unraveling, consumed her. 

With a shiver, Lily curled up on the couch, hugging her knees to her chest. She could see it all so clearly in her mind's eye—the day Alexander found out, the disgust in his voice, the hurt in his eyes. And the thought of him walking away from her forever... 

Her breath caught in her throat, and she squeezed her eyes shut, willing the thoughts away. She didn't want to lose him, but every step she took seemed to lead her closer to that inevitable end. 

And somewhere in the depths of her mind, a chilling thought lingered: What if it's already too late? 

As the door to the sitting room creaked open, Lily froze, her heart hammering in her chest. 

The truth—her truth—was about to catch up with her.
###Chapter 6

Aurora City's elite enclave shimmered in the late afternoon sun,its crown jewel,the Garden Estate, standing like a fortress of opulence. Built by the Kane Corporation, the estate boasted both luxury and unmatched security.making it impenetrable to outsiders without proper clearance. Grandma Helen found this exclusivity an unnecessary ordeal.

As her car passed through the final security checkpoint, she sighed heavily,her annoyance palpable. "Why must I endure this charade every single time? My grandson couldn't even bother to inform his staff that I'm not just any visitor."


"Patience, Grandma," her companion soothed,though with little success.

Helen shifted her gaze to the estate's sprawling landscape.Manicured lawns stretched endlessly, accented by gardens bursting with color. She grudgingly admitted, "At least the view is worth something.”

Upon arriving at the mansion, a team of bodyguards sprang into action,opening the car door and bowing respectfully. Helen stepped out with an air of authority, her sharp eyes scanning the area as if she were inspecting her territory.


"Welcome, Grandma," a maid named Clara greeted her, rushing out to meet her.

Helen wasted no time."Where is the woman my grandson married?"

"She isn't back yet, Ma'am," Clara replied nervously. "But she mentioned she would return by 3 p.m."

Helen nodded curtly.“Fine. I'll wait." The clock ticked closer to 3 p.m. when Lily Evans pulled up to the estate.She noticed the unfamiliar car parked outside and hesitated. Was Alexander back? Her heart skipped a beat at the possibility.though whether it was anticipation or dread,she couldn't tell.

Inside. Clara met her at the door. "You're back, Miss Evans."

"Yes," Lily answered,setting her belongings down.

"I'll take these to your room," Clara offered. “MIrs. Kane is waiting for you in the living room.”


"Mrs. Kane?” Lily's brow furrowed.

"Mr. Kane's grandmother," Clara clarified.

Realization dawned on Lily, and she quickly smoothed her hair and adjusted her simple outfit. “I'll see her right away."

Lily stepped into the living room, her heart pounding. Sitting in an ornate armchair was a woman whose presence commanded the room. Helen's sharp eyes studied Lily before offering a faint smile, one that didn't quite reach her eyes.


"Hello, Grandma. It's nice to meet you," Lily greeted you with a polite smile, masking her nervousness.


Helen gestured to the seat across from her, "Sit down, dear." Lily obeyed, her posture poised and respectful. Helen observed her, noting the unassuming grace in Lily's movements. Despite her simple attire,she carried herself with a quiet dignity that intrigued Helen. “1assume you're the one my grandson married?" Helen asked, her tone neutral.

"Yes, Grandma." Lily replied softly.


Helen chuckled, a glint of amusement breaking through her usual stern demeanor. “Well, I already like you. Alexander may have stumbled into this, but he's made a good choice.”


Lily smiled politely but avoided holding Helen's gaze fortoo long,unsure of what to make of the compliment.

"What's your name, dear?" Helen asked, her curiosity piqued.

"Lily Evans," she replied.

"Lily Evans," Helen repeated, letting the name roll off her tongue.“A lovely name."

"Thank you,Grandma.”

Helen leaned forward slightly, her tone softening.“Tell me about yourself.Lily. What do you love to do?"


Lily opened her mouth to respond, but a familiar voice cut through the air,cold and unyielding.


"There's no need for that," Alexander said, striding into the room. "This marriage will last only a year and six months.”

Lily froze, her composure shattering for a brief moment before she masked her hurt. Helen's frown deepened at her grandson's callousness,but she quickly turned back to Lily with a reassuring smile.

Lily stood abruptly, attempting to steer the conversation."What would you like to eat, Grandma? I'll prepare something for you." Alexander's brow furrowed, his displeasure evident.

Such a considerate offer earned Helen's approval.“You're a sweet child.
but there's no need. I have other engagements to attend."

“Let me see you off, then," Lily offered, moving towardthe door.


Before she could take another step. Alexander stepped in front of her, his towering presence cutting off her path. His dark eyes locked onto hers, and though her heart raced, she forced herself to meet his gaze briefly before looking away.


"Clara will see her off," he said firmly.

Helen left with a knowing smile, pleased with her visi but aware of the tension in the air.


As the sound of the car faded into the distance, Alexander handed Lily a folder."Sign both copies and give one to Clara," he said curtly, his tone brooking no argument.

Lily held the folder in her trembling hands, watching as he turned and left without another word. She exhaled shakily, steeling herself before retreating to her room.

Alone,she carefully read through the new contract, her stomach churning as each clause confirmed the cold, transactional nature of their arrangement. With a resigned sigh, she signed both copies and delivered one to Clara. Later, in the kitchen, Lily overheard the hushed whispers of the staff. "Why is Mr. Kane back so early?”one asked nervously. "He's in a foul mood," another muttered.

Their fear was palpable, and Lily stepped in to reassure them. "It's fine.Go on with your work. I won't say anything.”

Clara approached her hesitantly. “Is there anything else you need, Miss Evans?”


Lily shook her head, her mind already preoccupied. "Just tell me where I can find Mr.Kane."


"He should be in his study," Clara replied.

Following the maid's directions, Lily made her way to the study. Her nerves prickled as she raised her hand to knock, hesitated, then knocked softly.


No response.

She was about to try again when a familiar, icy voice came from behind her,sending a chill down her spine.

"What are you doing here?" Alexander demanded, his presence looming as he stepped closer.
###Chapter 7

Lily froze as Alexander Kane's imposing frame approached, his expression unreadable and his movements precise. He stopped a mere step away, the tension between them palpable.

"I came to give you this," she said, her voice steadier than she felt,extending the signed contract toward him.

Alexander's sharp gaze flickered to the document. He didn't move to take it. "I instructed you to hand it to Clara," he said, his voice cold, laced with quiet authority.

"She might be busy," Lily replied, summoning her courage. "So I decided to bring it myself."

A flicker of something-amusement, perhaps-passed across his face before his demeanor hardened again. He stepped closer, invading her space.Lily's pulse quickened.

"Did you bring it yourself intentionally?" he asked, his tone low and probing, his eyes locked onto hers as if searching for something hidden beneath her calm facade.

"Huh?" Lily blinked, her confusion genuine.

Alexander studied her for a moment longer, the tension between them stretching taut. Then, without warning, he snatched the contract from her hand,his touch igniting a shiver that raced down her spine. "You can leave now," he said flatly. He turned abruptly, disappearing into his study, the door closing behind him with a decisive click. Lily exhaled slowly, the weight of his cold dismissal pressing on her chest. She turned and walked away, the sound of her heels echoing in the silent corridor.

The evening passed insolitude, the grand dining room feeling cavernous as Lily ate alone. Alexander had requested his meal be brought to his study,leaving her with nothing but the company of her thoughts and the suffocating weight of their arrangement.

By morning. Lily had resolved to reclaim some semblance of normalcy.She dressed for work, her modest outfit reflecting her practical mindset.The coffee shop she managed had been closed for two days, and she was eager to immerse herself in something familiar.

As she descended the stairs, skipping breakfast in her rush, she was startled to find Alexander seated in the living room, a newspaper in hand.

He glanced up, his dark eyes unreadable. "You'll never understand why,"he said suddenly, his voice cutting through the quiet like a blade.

Lily froze. Had she spoken her thoughts aloud?

Alexander lowered the newspaper deliberately, his gaze sweeping over her with unsettling intensity. He stood, his movements measured.

"Let's go," he commnanded, his tone leaving no room for negotiation.

"You mean us?" she asked, her confusion evident.

"Is there someone else here, Miss Evans?" His voice was clipped,his impatience clear. "I... Where are we going?" she stammered. "No questions," he snapped,stepping toward her. "But I have to

"Did you forget the terms of the contract?" His voice was sharper now.each word cutting like ice. He loomed over her, his presence suffocating. "One thing I detest is repeating myself. Don't make me do it again."

Lily swallowed hard, foreing herself to meet his piercing gaze. Her defiance flickered, but his intensity smothered it.


"You are coming with me," he declared, his grip firm as he seized her wrist and pulled her toward the door.


She stumbled slightly but quickly steadied herself, biting her lip to suppress her frustration. He released her only when they reached the waiting car.


"Get in," he ordered, his tone brooking no argument.


Lily obeyed, sliding into the car. She winced at the faint ache in her wrist,her fingers brushing against the faint bruise. Her gaze flickered to Alexander, who was already engrossed in his laptop, his focus unyielding.She turned her attention to the window, the city blurring past as they drove in silence.


The car finally pulled into the sprawling grounds of an upscale hospital.The sleek, modern building loomed before them, its reputation for catering to the wealthy and powerful unmistakable. Lily followed Alexander into the building, her unease growing with each step. They ascended to the 14th floor, the air growing heavier with unspoken tension. Her breath hitched as they entered the gynecology department. Her heart sank. She had known the marriage's purpose-to produce an heir-but the cold efficiency with which Alexander moved left her shaken.

"Mr. Kane," a middle-aged man greeted warmly, extending a hand.

"Dr. Williams," Alexander replied curtly, shaking his hand with a firm grip.

Dr. Williams glanced at Lily, his curiosity apparent. "And this must be-"


"Lily Evans," Alexander interrupted.

"Nice to meet you, Miss Evans," the doctor said with a friendly smile.

Lily nodded politely,forcing a small smile.

"Let's get straight to it," Alexander said, his impatience evident.

Dr. Williams raised an eyebrow but led them to his office.Alexander's commanding presence filled the room as he settled into a chair, while Lily perched nervously on the edge of hers.


The doctor listened as Alexander laid out his request, his expression shifting from surprise to amusement.


"IVF?" Dr. Williams asked finally, a faint chuckle escaping him. "That's your plan? I'd recommend something... simpler."

Alexander's cold glare silenced him instantly. "We're proceeding with IVF,"he said firmly.


The doctor sighed,leaning back in his chair.′′It′sa time-intensive  process.Are you sure it aligns with your...timeline?" Alexander's jaw tightened. "I freed my morning for this. Don't waste my time." Dr. Williams nodded reluctantly. "Very well. We'll begin preliminary tests today." He turned to Lily. "Miss Evans, if you'll come with me."


Lily hesitated but stood, glancing at Alexander. His expression remained impassive, his attention already back on his phone.

The tests were invasive and clinical, each step stripping away more of Lily's autonomy. By the time they returned to the office,she felt drained.

"Everything is in motion," Dr. Williams said, addressing Alexander.


Alexander stood, his presence as overbearing as ever. "Good. Keep me updated."


As they left the hospital, the tension in the air was suffocating. In the car,Lily finally dared to glance at Alexander.

"Prepare yourself," he said without looking at her, his voice low and ominous. "This is just the beginning."

Lily turned back to the window, her chest tightening. Whatever lay ahead,it promised to be anything but simple.
###Chapter 8

Flashback at the Hospital...

The sterile office was eerily silent, the tension stretching like a taut wire.Alexander Kane leaned back in his chair, his piercing gaze locked on Dr.Desmond. "Isn't there a faster way to determine if she can conceive?" he asked, his voice cold and deliberate.


Dr. Desmond sighed. "The only way to know is to proceed with IVF.Medical advancements haven't yet reached the point where we can predict outcomes without taking preliminary steps."


Alexander's jaw tightened, his frustration barely contained. "What about the normal method?" Dr. Desmond ventured cautiously, eyeing Alexander."It's faster, more reliable, and considering your timeline, more logical."

Alexander's expression darkened, his eyes glinting like shards of ice. "You know as well as I do, Desmond, that I didn't marry her by choice. This isn't a matter of desire-it's business. Do the tests and proceed with IVF.No further discussion."


Dr. Desmond raised his hands in a gesture of surrender. "As you wish,"he muttered, his tone laced with resignation.


The door to the office opened, and Alexander stepped out, his presence commanding the space. Lily quickly stood, catching his steely gaze before he turned away. "It was nice meeting you, Lily," Dr. Desmond said, trailing after him."Shame we can't have that lunch date, but I hope we can still be friends."His warm smile momentarily eased the tension. Lily managed a polite smile. "Nice meeting you too. Dr. Desmond."

Alexander's pace quickened, his impatience evident. Lily hesitated before following, her heels clicking against the pristine floor as she tried to keep up.


By the time she reached the parking garage, Alexander was already seated in the car, his posture rigid. He glanced up as sheapproached,his expression unreadable. "What are you waiting for? Get in. I don't have all day."


Lily's brows furrowed. "I'll get to work from here. You don't need to drop me off."


Alexander's gaze sharpened his tone like a whip crack. "I don't recall askingfor your opinion. Get in."

Reluctantly, Lily slid into the car, her frustration mounting. The vehicle pulled away, the silence inside suffocating. She stared out the window,determined to ignore him.


Halfway through the drive, his voice broke the silence, low and cutting. "So.you were eager for that date?"


Lily blinked, confused. "What?"

Alexander's gaze burned into her. "Miss Evans, don't feign ignorance.I saw how easily you smiled at his cheap flattery. Or are you like every other woman, swayed by hollow compliments?" Her hands balled into fists."Idon't- " "Save it," he snapped, his words slicing through her like a blade. Lily clenched her jaw, swallowing her restort. The weight of his accusations settled on her like a suffocating blanket. She pieced together his insinuation-he was referring to Dr. Desmond's lighthearted remark.The realization stung more than she cared to admit.

The car slowed in front of her coffee shop. Before it had fully stopped,Lily stepped out, her movements brisk and deliberate. She didn't look back as she strode toward the entrance, her spine rigidI with anger.

Inside, Sarah, her trusted confidante, greeted her with wide eyes."Who was that?" she asked, her tone dripping with curiosity.

Lily exhaled slowly, forcing a smile. "Guess."

Sarah's brows furrowed. "I can't. You've been keeping a low profile ever since...well,you know. So,who is it?"

Lily hesitated before answering. "Alexander Kane."

Sarah's jaw dropped. "You're joking, right? The Alexander Kane? Cold-hearted billionaire? What's he doing here?"

Lily leaned against the counter, her resolve wavering."It's... complicated."

Sarah narrowed her eyes. "Start talking."

Over the next several minutes, Lily recounted the events of the past few days, her voice steady despite the whirlwind of emotions coursing through her. Sarah listened intently, her disbelief growing with each word. When Lily finished, Sarah shook her head. "This is insane. You're telling me you married him under a contract to have his child? What if he never cares for you? What about your plan to seek justice for your sisters?" Lily's expression hardened. "I haven't forgotten my purpose. This marriage is just a detour. I'll find the evidence I need and ensure those responsible pay."

Sarah's gaze softened. "Just... don't lose yourself in this, Lily.Promise me."

"I won't." Lily said firmly, though a flicker of doubt tugged at her.


That evening, she returned to the mansion, exhaustion settling over her like a heavy cloak. As she stepped inside, Clara greeted her with an unusually formal tone.


"Welcome back, ma'am."

Lily blinked. Ma'am? Yesterday, everyone had called her Miss Evans.
What had changed?

"Thank you, Clara," she said cautiously.

"Would you like dinner, ma'am?"

"I've already eaten. I'll head upstairs now."


Clara nodded but hesitated. "Before you go, ma'am, there's something you should know."


"What is it?"

"Mr. Kane instructed us to move your belongings into his bedroom today."

Lily froze, her heart pounding. "His bedroom?" "Yes, ma'am. It was his direct order," Clara said, her tone neutral. Lily stood rooted to the spot, her mind racing, Alexander Kane's motives were a labyrinth she couldn't begin to decipher. And now, as the realization sank in, she felt the weight of the next movement pressing down on her like a dark cloud.


What was he planning?
###Chapter 9

Lily froze as Clara's words echoed in her mind. Her belongings had been moved to Alexander Kane's room. She hadn't prepared for this, mentally or emotionally. A shiver of unease coursed through her. It wasn't passion driving him to do this-it was a necessity. The weight of reality pressed down on her chest, suffocating.


For any other woman, sharing a room with Alexander might have been a dream, but for Lily, it felt like walking into a trap.

"Ma'am?" Clara's voice snapped her out of her thoughts.

Lily straightened, masking her turmoil. "I'll head up now. Good night,Clara."


"Good night,ma'am."

The elevator ride to the top floor was suffused with a tension Lily couldn't shake. When the doors opened, she stepped into a world that felt starkly different from the rest of the house. The air here seemed colder, heavier.The grand double doors loomed before her, and as she pushed one open,the master bedroom greeted her with its imposing elegance.


The space was vast, with dark, masculine tones dominating the decor.Everything screamed wealth and power, yet there was an unsettling emptiness to it. Her gaze flicked to the walk-in closet, where her belongings had been meticulously arranged. It all felt surreal. A year ago, she had watched him from afar at a business conference, her heart foolishly fluttering at the sight of him. Back then, she had admired him and dreamed of a connection that now seemed laughable.He was a man of steel, emotionally detached and driven by cold pragmatism.

Lily shook off the memories. She wasn't here for love or dreams. She was here to fulfill a contract-a business transaction with high stakes.

She explored the room briefly, her fingers brushing against the pristine sheets of the bed. The reality of sharing this space with him sent a chill down her spine. She took a deep breath, heading to the en-suite bathroom to wash away the tension clinging to her skin.


After a long bath, she slipped into her nightwear and climbed into bed.Sleep came fitfully, the weight of her situation pressing on her chest.

But hours later, something jolted her awake.


Her eyes shot open, and her breath hitched. Alexander was sitting on the edge of the bed, still in his suit. His face was unreadable, his piercing gaze locked on her.


"You're back," she said cautiously,sitting up.

He didn't respond, his silence more oppressive than any words could have been.


"I heard my things were moved here," she pressed, though she already knew why. "Care to explain?" Alexander stood, his movements deliberate as he removed his jacket and began loosening his tie. "A woman who adds clauses to a contract without hesítation shouldn't ask such an obvious question," he said, his tone laced with disdain. Lily bristled at the insult. It was his second one today, and her patience was wearing thin. She clenched her fists, forcing herself to stay calm. Without a word, she swung her legs off the bed, grabbed her phone, and headed for the door.

But before she could reach it, his hand closed around her wrist,yanking her back with an iron grip.

"And where do you think you're going?" His voice was low, dangerous.

"Away from you and your insults,"she snapped, trying to wrench free.

His grip only tightened. "Don't test me, Lily."

In one swift motion, he dragged her back and threw her onto the bed. She gasped,her body jolting from the impact. Before she could scramble away,he was on top of her, his weight pinning her down.

"What are you doing?" she demanded, her voice trembling.

"This is your room now," he said, his hand brushing a strand of hair from her face with unsettling gentleness. "Until you're pregnant."


His words sent a chill through her, but it was his touch-light,almost tender-that made her heart pound. She stared up at him, her breath hitching as his face hovered closer.


Then his lips were on hers, firm and insistent. She froze, her mind racing.This wasn't part of theplan. She wasn't supposed to feel anything, yet the heat of his kiss ignited something deep within her. When he bit her bottom lip, she gasped, givinghim the opening he sought.His kiss deepened, consuming her. His hands began to roam, their touch sending shivers down her spine. She wanted to resist, but her body betrayed her, responding to his évery move. It wasn't just about duty anymore. This was the man she had secretly admired, and now he was unraveling her completely.

Alexander moved with an intensity that left her breathless, his actions both calculated and overwhelming. He was relentless, and by the time he was done,she was utterly spent.

As sleep claimed her, one thought lingered: Was this just for the child,or was there something more?

The next morning, she awoke to find him lying beside her,his gaze fixed on her. Her heart skipped a beat. She quickly turned away, her cheeks flushing as memories of the night flooded her mind.

"I need to get to work," she muttered, trying to rise.

But Alexander's hand shot out, pulling her back. "You're not going anywhere," he said, his voice firm.

Lily's breath caught as he leaned in, his lips brushing her ear. "You'll stay here until I decide otherwise."

His words sent a shiver down her spine, and when she felt his hand begin to trace the curve of her waist, she knew the night's intensity was far from over.


And this time, she wasn't sure if she wanted him to stop.
###Chapter 10

Lily's hands shook as she spread the photos across the table. The images,though slightly grainy, carried a chilling clarity. A shadowy figure loomed in the background, his stance casual yet deliberate, the camera poised at the ready. Whoever had taken these photos hadn't been an innocent bystander; they had been watching, waiting, documenting.


"Look at the photos closely," Lily said, her voice tight with unease.She tapped on one of the images, pointing to the angle. "From this perspective,they weren't in the public park. They were across the street, somewhere hidden. This wasn't accidental."


Michael leaned forward, his brows furrowing as he examined the pictures.His lips pressed into a thin line, and the tension in his shoulders became visible. "You think someone was spying on you?"


"Not just me," Lily replied, her tone clipped as she began gathering the photos back into their folder. "This angle, this distance-it's not random.Someone planned this." She stood abruptly, grabbing her bag. "I need to check it out myself."

Michael rose quickly, stepping into her path and grabbing her arm. His grip was firm but not harsh, his eyes locking onto hers with an intensity that made her pause.

"Don't," he said, his voice steady and commanding.

She blinked up at him, startled. Michael rarely asserted himself like this,but theconcern in his gaze was unmistakable.

"Why not?" she challenged, her resolve faltering. He sighed, his grip softening but not releasing. "Going there will only bring back memories of that day. You've barely recovered as it is. Let me handle this."

His words struck a nerve, and Lily's shoulders slumped slightly. He was right-returning to the scene would be like tearing open a barely healed wound. The memories of that day, of losing her sisters so brutally, were still too raw.


"Fine," she relented after a long pause. "But promise me you'll keep me updated."

"I will," Michael assured her, finally letting go of her arm.

The tension in the room didn't dissipate as quickly as his grip, though. A silence settled between them, heavy with unspoken emotions. Michael's eyes remained on her, his expression unreadable, as if he was weighing whether to say something more.

Finally, he broke the silence. "Can I ask you something, Lily?"

She stilled, sensing the shift in his tone. "What is it?"


Michael hesitated,glancing briefly at Matthew, who sat quietly nearby but was listening intently. Then, as if deciding to press forward,he asked,"Why don't you live here anymore? Where did you move to... and why?"

The question hit her like a punch to the gut. She froze, her pulse quickening as the weight of his curiosity bore down on her. From the corner of her eye, she saw Matthew lift his head, his gaze sharpening. Though he hadn't voiced it, it was clear he shared Michael's curiosity. Lily swallowed hard,her mind racing for an answer. How could she possibly explain it? The truth-that she had entered into a contract marriage with Alexander Kane, a man as cold as he was enigmatic-was too complicated, too raw. They wouldn't understand. How could they,when she barely understood it herself?

"I..." she began, but the words caught in her throat.

Michael's eyes narrowed slightly, his patience wearing thin. "Lily,are you in trouble?" he asked, his voice softer now, tinged with concern.

Matthew leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees as he watched her intently. "It's not like you to be so evasive," he added. "If something's wrong,you know you can tell us."


Their concern only made the truth harder to bear. They didn't just want answers-they wanted to protect her. But this wasn't a situation they could shield her from.


"I moved for... personal reasons," she finally said, her voice barely above a whisper.


Michael frowned, clearly unsatisfied with her vague response. "Personal reasons? That's it? That's all you're giving us?"

Lily forced a weak smile, trying to lighten the tension. "Come on, Michael.Not everything in my life has to be an open book."

His frown deepened, but he didn't push further. Matthew, however, wasn't so easily deterred.


"Personal reasons don't explain why you've been so secretive lately," he said, his tone laced with suspicion. "You've been distant, Lily. More than usual. It's like you're hiding something." Lily's chest tightened, her resolve wavering under his scrutiny. Matthew's perceptiveness was both a blessing and a curse. He saw too much,read between lines she hadn't even written.


"I'm not hiding anything," she lied, her voice firmer this time. "I just needed a change of pace. That's all."

Matthew's gaze lingered on her for a moment longer, his eyes searching hers as if trying to uncover the truth she was so desperate to conceal.Finally,he leaned back in his chair, his expression unreadable.

"Fine," he said, though his tone suggested he wasn't entirely convinced.

Michael exchanged a glance with Matthew, then sighed. "If you ever need to talk..."


"I know," Lily interrupted, offering him a small smile. "And I appreciate it.Really."


The tension in the room eased slightly, but it didn't disappear entirely.The weight of unspoken truths hung in the air, a reminder that this conversation was far from over.


Lily took a deep breath and grabbed her coat, her movements brisk and purposeful. "I need to go," she said, her tone final. "I'll call you later."

Michael opened his mouth to protest, but the look she gave him silenced him.Matthew, meanwhile, simply watched her, his expression unreadable. As she stepped out into the cold night, the chill bit at her skin, but it was nothing compared to the icy fear gnawing at her insides. Her phone buzzed in her pocket, pulling her attention. She pulled it out,her breath catching as sheread the message displayed on the screen. "You can't run forever. Lily. We're always watching."

Her blood turned to ice, and her grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles turned white.


The shadows weren't just a memory of her past. They were alive,present,and closing in.


Lily climbed into her car, her hands trembling as she gripped the steering wheel. She stared out into the darkened street, her heart poundíng in her chest.


For the first time in a long while, she felt truly trapped.

And she wasn't sure she'd make it out unscathed.
###Chapter 11

Lily's voice cut through the quiet of the room like a blade. "I got married."

Michael and Matthew both froze as if time itself had stalled. The words hung in the air, heavy and unfathomable, like a thunderclap on a clear day.

"You did what?" MichaeI's voice finally broke the silence, sharp and incredulous. He looked as though someone had punched him.

Matthew's reaction wasn't any better. "Are you serious, Lily?" His normally calm demeanor fractured, his disbelief plain. “Married? When?To whom?”


Lily clenched her hands tightly, her knuckles turning white. She hadn't planned to drop this bombshell so abruptly, but there was no easy way to reveal the truth. "A few days ago," she said quietly, her words barely above a whisper.

Michael ran a hand through his hair, pacing the small space like a storm brewing on the horizon. "A few days ago?" he echoed. "Who in the world-”


“Alexander Kane," Lily said firmly, cutting him off.

The room went dead still. Matthew's head snapped toward her,his mouth slightly agape as if he hadn't heard right. Michael stopped pacing mid-step,his face blanching as the name sunk in. “Alexander Kane?” Matthew half-shouted, disbelief shaking his voice.“Alexander Kane? You mean the Alexander Kane? Lily, are you out of your mind?” "Yes,” Lily said, squaring her shoulders and meeting their stunned gazes.“ I married Alexander Kane."

Matthew collapsed into his chair as if the weight of her words had physically pushed him down. "Jesus Christ," he muttered, dragging a hand over his face."Alexander of all people..."

Michael stared at her, searching her expression for answers.“Why?"His voice was quieter now, no longer angry but deeply concerned.“Why him?Lily,what have you gotten yourself into?"

Lily hesitated, the truth resting heavily on her tongue.'It'scomplicated."she said finally, her voice faltering.

Matthew shot her a sharp look. "Complicated doesn't even begin to describe it. Do you know who he is, Lily? He's not just some businessman.He's ruthless-powerful beyond anything you can imagine. You married into a life of constant scrutiny and danger."

Michael stepped closer, his tone pleading now. "Lily, you can't trust him.Alexander Kane doesn't do anything without reason. What's his angle here? What does he want from you?”

She bit her lip, struggling to hold her composure. "It's a contract marriage."

"A contract?" Matthew blurted, his voicerising again. “You're telling me you married the most dangerous man in the city for some sort of deal?"

“I had no choice," Lily confessed, her voice low but firm. "It was the only way.” Michael stepped back as if her words had physically struck him. "The only way for what?" "To protect myself," Lily replied. "To keep my past buried and stay one step ahead of the people looking for me. Alexander can give me the protection I need."


“Protection?" Matthew exclaimed, disbelief still clouding his face.“Lily,you're playing with fire. If your grandfather finds out about this marriage,it's game over. He'll come for you, and Alexander Kane isn't the kind of man to let someone meddle with his affairs."


"I know," Lily admitted softly, "which is why you both have to help me.”She looked directly at Matthew. "I need you to make sure my family doesn't find me yet. I can't risk it. Not now.”

Matthew's expression darkened as he let out a slow breath.“Lily,your grandfather's reach is almost limitless. And now you're tangled with Alexander, whose influence might be just as dangerous."

"I know what I'm asking," Lily said, her voice steady but pleading.“But I have no other choice. Lucas, please. Just buy me more time."

Matthew pinched the bridge of his nose, clearly frustrated, but he nodded reluctantly. “Fine. I'll do what I can. But you're walking a razor's edge.Lily. One slip, and you'll lose everything."

Michael remained silent for a long time, his gaze fixed on her like he was trying to see through every layer of her defenses. Finally, he spoke. “Is this really what you want?"


Lily couldn't answer him. Instead, she turned away, her silence speaking louder than words. By the time Lily reached Alexander's mansion, the night had grown dark and heavy, the city's lights dimming against the horizon. The traffic had been unbearable, and it was nearly 10 p.m. when she pulled up to the estate. What she saw next stopped her in her tracks.

The staff-maids, security guards, and even Clara-were waiting outside in the cold, their expressions unreadable. The sight unsettled her, an inexplicable chill running down her spine.

"She's back," one of the maids whispered, and Clara quickly stepped forward, her relief palpable.

"Ma'am,you're finally home," Clara said, though her voice held something unspoken.

Lily frowned, confusion knitting her brows. "Why are you all standing out here? What's going on?"

Clara hesitated, glancing at the other staff before responding.“Mr.Alexander ordered us to wait outside until you returned.”

Lily's stomach dropped.“What?”

"Yes, ma'am,"one of the younger maids said timidly.“We've been waiting for hours."


“Enough," Clara snapped at the girl, clearly trying to contain the situation.She turned back to Lily, forcing a smile. "Please come inside. It's cold."

Lily didn't move. "Is this true, Clara?" Her voice was tight.


Clara avoided her gaze,"Now that you're back, everything is fine." The unease bubbling in Lily's chest only grew. She entered the house, her steps quick as she made her way upstairs. The mansion felt eerily quiet,as though it were holding its breath. When she opened the door to the bedroom, the emptiness struckher like a physical blow.

Alexander wasn't there. The bed was perfectly made, the room pristine,but something felt wrong. When she opened the closet, her unease turned into dread. Her clothes-her old, familiar belongings-were gone. In their place were pristine, luxurious garments that screamed wealth but felt like a stranger's wardrobe.

Panic swelled in her throat as she rifled through the clothes, tossing designer fabrics aside in search of her things. Her hands shook when she realized the scarf-her sister's scarf-was missing.

Storming into Alexander's study, Lily didn't knock. She threw the door open,her voice trembling with anger. "Where are my things?"

Alexander sat behind his desk, calm and composed as ever. He looked up at her,displeased by her interruption."How dare you barge into my office?”


"Where are my things?" she demanded again, ignoring his cold tone.“You had no right to move them."

His gaze darkened, his displeasure sharp enough to cut. He stood, closing the distance between them in two strides. Before she could react,he pinned her against the wall, his hands bracing on either side of her.

"This is my house, Lily," he said quietly, his voice deadly calm. "I can do whatever I please. Don't forget that,” Lily refused to flinch, meeting his eyes with defiance. "I don't care whose house this is. There's something important to me that you've taken." Alexander stared at her for a long moment, his expression unreadable.Then, he smirked faintly. "Important,you say?" "Yes," she hissed. her voice shaking with emotion. "Where is it?"

Alexander's gaze burned into her. "What's more important. Lily?"he murmured, his voice like silk laced with steel. "Your past... or your place in this house?”


Before she could answer, he leaned closer, his lips brushing against her ear.


"Be careful what you cling to," he whispered. "It might disappear before your eyes."


Her blood ran cold. As he stepped back, his words lingered like a curse,and for the first time. Lily wondered if Alexander Kane already knew far more than he let on.
###Chapter 12

The silence in Alexander's study was stifling, broken only by Lily's measured breathing as she tore her gaze from his. "Let me go," she demanded, her voice steady but laced with sharp tension.

Alexander didn't move. His grip on her arm was ironclad, his dark eyes boring into hers like twin blades, cold and unforgiving. The anger thathad colored his face moments ago dissolved, leaving an expression even more unsettling-one of complete detachment.

"I said let me go." Lily's voice was firmer this time,steel threaded through each word.


For a long, unbearable moment, he didn't react. Then, with a quiet exhale that hinted at frustration, he loosened his hold and stepped back. The air between them crackled with unspoken animosity as Lily turned abruptly.walking away without so much as a glance behind her.


Her pulse thundered in her ears as she strode through the mansion,rage simmering beneath her calm exterior. Alexander's audacity to remove her belongings-her memories-without so much as a warning felt like a violation she couldn't forgive. She would have her things back.


Lily's steps faltered as she intercepted Clara near the dining room. The housekeeper seemed startled, her usually composed demeanor tinged with guilt."Ma'am, do you need something? Shall I prepare dinner?" "No," Lily replied curtly, swallowing her anger as she fixed Clara with a hard stare. "Where did you put my belongings?"Clara hesitated, wringing her hands. "Mr. Kane ordered us to replace them with new items. Your things were... discarded,ma'am." "Discarded?" The word felt like a slap. Her stomach dropped. "Where?"

Clara hesitated. "The bins outside.But-"

Lily didn't wait for her to finish. Her blood ran cold as she turned sharply.determination tightening her spine. She ignored Clara's protests. ignored the growing chill that clung to her damp skin, and pushed through the massive front doors into the night.

The estate'sgrounds were vast, eerily silent beneath the dark sky. The soft glow of the mansion's lights offered little comfort as Lily made her way toward the bins near the staff quarters, her breath fogging in the cold air.

This is madness, she told herself. But she didn't stop. Couldn't stop.

Clara hurried after her. "Ma'am, please, let me help you! It's freezing out here!"


Lily ignored her, her hands trembing from the cold as she reached the first bin. Her fingers dug through discarded items-wrappers,broken utensils, torn packaging-each touch staining her skin. The humiliation burned like frostbite, but she kept going. Somewhere in this pile of carelessness were her scarves-her last tangible memories of her sisters.

Her fingers brushed against something soft. Lily froze. Heart pounding.she pulled it out: three scarves, worn and frayed at the edges, their faded patterns familiar and comforting. She held them to her chest, choking back a sob as the weight of the moment crashed over her. The memory of her sisters' smiles, their laughter on that final day,flickered through her mind like lightning. Those scarves were all she had left of them-symbols of a loss she had been forced to endure alone.Alexander had no right to take this from her. A chill ran down her spine. Slowly, she looked up, her instincts prickling.From the mansion's second-floor window. Alexander watched her.His silhouette was stark against the faint light of the study, unmoving,unreadable. He had seen everything.


For a moment, they stared at each other-her.broken and clutching the tattered pieces of her past; him, shrouded in shadows, observing her like a predator gauging his prey. The wind howled softly around her, and Lily's chest tightened.


Why is he watching me?

"Lily, come back inside. You're freezing!" Clara pleaded,her voice faint beneath the roar of Lily's thoughts.

Lily rose to her feet, swaying slightly as she hugged the scarves closer to her trembling body. Without a word, she turned back to the mansion,her mind a storm of emotions she couldn't contain.

Once inside, Clara reached for her, offering a blanket. "Please, ma'am, let me help you-"

"No." Lily cut her off, her voice barely above a whisper. "I'll handle this myself."


She ascended the grand staircase, her movements deliberate, her expression cold. She didn't head to the master bedroom but instead to the small guest room Alexander had first assigned her. Once inside, she locked the door,shutting out the world. Lily sank onto the edge of the bed, the scarves clutched to her chest as the tears she'd been holding back finally broke free. She didn't make a sound.She couldn't. The memories came rushing in-her sisters' faces, their warmth, their love, and the hollow void their deaths had left behind.

The hours dragged on, the house silent except for the faint creaks of the old walls. Outside, the wind beat against the windows, echoing the ache in her chest.

The next morning. Sarah arrived early at the coffee shop, only to find Lily already there, seated alone in the far corner. A scarf was wrapped tightly around her shoulders, her pale skin ashen against the dark fabric.

"Lily!" Sarah hurried to her side, alarmed. "What happened? You look-"

"I'm fine," Lily murmured, though her hollow eyes said otherwise.

Sarah touched her friend's hand and flinched at how icy it was. "You're freezing! What's going on? Did... did he hurt you?"

Lily shook her head, her voice barely audible. "It's not him. It's the memories."

Sarah's gaze dropped to the scarf Lily clung to. Understanding dawned,and her expression softened with concern. "What triggered them? What happened,Lily?"


Lily opened her mouth to respond, but before a word could escape, her body swayed. The room tilted violently, and she collapsed, unconscious.

"Lily!" Sarah shouted, catching her friend just before she hit the ground.Panic seized her as she checked Lily's pulse-weak, far too weak. Sarah's eyes darted toward the window, narrowing as she noticed movement outside. There-near the shop entrance-lingered two men pretending to read newspapers.Spies. Her instincts kicked in. She approached one of the men, her voice low and sharp. "Tell Alexander Kane that Miss Evans has collapsed. She needs a doctor,now.Go!"


The spy's surprise was brief; he nodded sharply and disappeared down the street.

Minutes later, the sound of tires screeching to a halt outside the coffee shop heralded Alexander's arrival. He burst through the door, his usual air of cool control fractured by the concern etched into his features.

Without a word, he crossed to Lily, scooping her frail form into his arms as if she weighed nothing. Sarah watched, stunned by the way his expression softened as he looked at Lily-protective,almost tender.

Alexander turned toward Sarah. "Which hospital?"

Sarah blinked. "The one nearby."

He didn't wait for more, carrying Lily out of the shop as though the world itself could not stop him.

Sarah stood frozen, the image of the enigmatic Alexander Kane holding her fragile friend lingering in her mind. For the first time, she realized Lily's connection to him was far deeper-and far more dangerous-than she had ever imagined.


And somewhere, deep inside her, a single chilling thought whispered: This is just the beginning.
###Chapter 13

The air inside the coffee shop was electric with tension as Sarah rushed back behind the counter. Her fingers trembled as she dialed Matthew's number,the weight of urgency pressing down on her like a stone. The line clicked, and Matthew's voice answered casually, though there was a thread of unease beneath his tone.

"Hey, Sarah. What's going on?”

"Matthew, it's Lily-she's been taken to the hospital. I don't know which one. Can you find her?" The words tumbled from her lips, sharp with panic.


There was a pause, then a shift in Matthew's voice-casual concern replaced by sharp alarm. “What happened?”

Before Sarah could respond, Michael's voice cut through the line, his tone edged with anxiety. "What do you mean she's in the hospital?”The sound of Matthew putting the phone on speaker made Sarah's pulse spike.

"She collapsed, Michael,” Sarah said, her frustration rising with her fear.“She showed up here shivering, clearly unwell. Then she fainted before I could do anything. I called her husband, and he took her. I-I didn't have time to follow them."


"Damn it, Sarah! How could younot find out where?" Michael snapped,his anger barely restrained. “You think I didn't try?" Sarah shot back, her voice rising. "He carried her out before I could even move." "Stop it, both of you," Matthew interrupted sharply, his calm precision cutting through the argument. "This isn't helping. We have bigger problems-hospitals use fingerprint ID systems. If anyone accesses her information, they'll start asking questions about who she is."

"Then block the system! 'That's your job, isn't it?" Sarah's tone was ice.

Matthew exhaled, already focused. "I'm on it. But don't shout at me unless you want me to stop."

"Find her. Matthew. Fast," Sarah demanded, her voice low and hard.


"I'll handle it," Matthew promised, typing furiously in the background.Moments passed in silence, each second heavier than the last. Finally, his voice returned. "Brightside Hospital. VIP Ward. Sending you the address now.”


Sarah snatched up her coat the moment the message came through.muttering.“You two stay out of this. If Alexander sees either of you near Lily,it'll make things worse."

Michael grumbled in protest, but Matthew cut him off. “She's right.
Alexander is already suspicious of us. Let Sarah handle this."

"Fine," Michael relented begrudgingly.

Without another word, Sarah stormed out of the coffee shop, the cold wind biting at her as she hailed a cab. As the city blurred past the window,her thoughts raced. Please let her be okay. The VIP wing of Brightside Hospital was unnervingly quiet when Sarah arrived. The scent of antiseptic lingered in the air and the hushed voices of nurses added to thesterile tension. She spotted Alexander instantly. He sat in a chair near Lily's room, his shoulders rigid, his gaze fixed on the closed door. Sarah paused, her pulse quickening. She had only ever heard of Alexander Kane-his cold reputation, his calculated ruthlessness. Seeing him in person was another thing entirely. His presence seemed to fill the hallway,dark and unyielding.


Before she could move, a doctor emerged from Lily's room. Alexander rose to his feet in one fluid motion, his expression tense, though his voice remained deceptively calm.

"How is she?”


“She's stable," the doctor said, removing his glasses and tucking them into his pocket. "It was a minor cold, compounded by exhaustion and exposure.
If you want her to maintain a healthy pregnancy, this cannot happen again. She needs rest and warmnth.”


Alexander's jaw twitched. “Noted."

The doctor gave him a knowing look. “You care about her more than you let on,you know."


“Enough,” Alexander snapped, though there was a flicker of something-guilt?-in his dark eyes.

The doctor said nothing more, retreating downthe hall. Alexander turned back toward the room, his hand hovering near the door handle, but he didn't enter. He stood there, staring at the door, the hesitation uncharacteristic of a man like him. Inside the private hospital room, Lily's eyelids fluttered open,her head pounding. She blinked against the harsh light overhead, disoriented by the sight of medical machines and the quiet hum of the monitors. A soft hand pressed against her shoulder as she tried to sit up. "Stay still. Lily," Sarah's familiar voice said gently.

"Sarah?" Lily croaked, confusion clouding her expression. "Where am I?”

"You're at Brightside Hospital. You collapsed,remember?"


The memories returned in fragments-her frantic search for the scarves,the cold, her body giving up as the world spun. "How long have I been here?”


"A few hours," Sarah replied softly. "Alexander brought you here."

Lily's eyes widened slightly."He did?”

"Yes,” Sarah said. “You're in a VIP ward."

Lily turned her head, taking in the luxurious surroundings.“A VIP room...
"Her voice trailed off, disbelief flickering across her face.


"You scared me, Lily. What happened?" Sarah pressed,her concern evident.


Lily hesitated, then finally explained everything-the scarves, the search.the emotions that overwhelmed her. By the end, Sarah's jaw was tight with anger.


“I'll have words with him," she vowed.Before Lily could respond, the door creaked open. Grandma Helen stepped inside, her presence commanding as always. Her eyes softened when they landed on Lily, though her tone remained firm. “Oh,my dear.How are you feeling?" “Grandma?" Lily blinked in surprise."How did you know I was here?" "I hear everything." Grandma Helen said dismissively, her voice tinged with disapproval. "That grandson of mine has been careless, and he will answer for it."


"Grandma, it's not a big deal-"

"Nonsense," Helen interrupted. “You need rest, and I won't have you staying here under his roof." She turned to Sarah, noticing her for the first time."And who is this?"


"I'm Sarah, a friend of Lily's," she said politely.

“Good," Helen nodded approvingly. “It's nice to know she has someone looking out for her." She turned back to Lily. “You're coming home with me after you're discharged. No arguments.”

Lily sighed,too tired to protest.


******

Meanwhile, in a towering office building downtown, Alexander sat at the head of a conference table, his expression unreadable as his executives pitched a rural development project. The silence stretched unbearably as he tapped his fingers rhythmically against the polished wood, the sound echoing like a ticking clock.

Finally, Alexander stopped, his voice cold and final. "Start over." With that, he rose, leaving stunned silence in his wake. James followed close behind as Alexander strode through the hallway, his steps quick and decisive."Any update on the hospital?" Alexander asked, his voice tight. James hesitated. "Miss Evans has been discharged. sir."

“Where did shego?" Alexander stopped walking. his gaze sharp as it pinned James in place.

"Wel. about that..." James shifted nervously. "Grandma Helen took her back to the family house."


The air seemed to crackle with tension. Alexander's grip tightened on his phone, his knuckles white.

"Return her." His voice dropped to a low growl, icy and final."Now.Grandma."
###Chapter 14

“Bring her back. Grandma."

Alexander's voice was ice, his words sharp enough to cut through steel. He stood by the towering windows of his office, the city lights shimmering like distant stars, but his focus was singular.


"No, Alexander." Grandma Helen's reply was calm but unyielding,laced with a subtle defiance. “She'll return in a few days. Right now, she needs peace and rest. wwhich she will not find under your roof."

His grp on the phone tightened, his knuckles whitening. “I said no.Send her back to my house now."

Grandma Helen's laugh was soft but deliberate, a subtle mockery of his demand. "You can command the world, my dear boy, but you cannot command me. Lilly stays with me."

The line went dead before he could respond.

Beep.

For a moment, the silence in the office was deafening. Then Alexander's jaw tightened, his frustration spilling over as he slammed the phone down on his desk. He turned toward James, his assistant, who stood frozen like a rabbit caught in the headlights. "Why wasn't I informed sooner?" Alexander's voice was dangerously low,but the fury beneath it was palpable. James stammered, his face pale. "I-I apologize, boss. I thought-” "No bonuses. For a year," Alexander interrupted, his tone like frost. James staggered under the weight of the punishment, his shoulders slumping in despair. A wave of whispers swept through the office hallways as employees overheard the declaration. Sympathy flickered in some eyes, but most turned away quickly, not daring to draw Alexander's attention.

Inside his office, Alexander's mind churned. His grandmother's audacity wasn't just a power play-it was a direct challenge. She knew him too well,knew exactly how to push his buttons. But what infuriated him most was that Lilly was now beyond his reach, her movements unknown,her vulnerability exposed.

On the road to the Alexander family mansion, Grandma Helen ended the call with a victorious smirk. She had outmaneuvered her grandson, at least for now.

Her gaze softened as she glanced at Lilly, who stirred on the leather seat beside her. Still groggy, Lilly blinked at the unfamiliar surrounadings,her brow furrowing.

"Where are we?" she murmured,her voice faint.

"We're going to the Alexander family estate," Grandma Helen said,her tone as soothing as a lullaby.“You'll stay with me for a few days. Rest is what you need, dear, and I intend to make sure you get it."

“But-”Lilly started,but Grandma Helen silenced her with a gentle pat on the hand. "No buts. Trust me, this is for the best." Lilly's gaze dropped to the scarves clutched in her lap, her fingers running over the soft fabric. Her mind drifted back to her sisters,the memories
  bittersweet.

"They meant a lot to you, didn't they?" Grandma Helen asked, her voice unusually tender.


"They're all I have left of them," Lilly whispered, her voice thick with emotion.


Grandma Helen nodded, her expression thoughtful. “And they'll remind you of your strength,too."

The Alexander mansion loomed in the distance, its grandeur intimidating even in the pale moonlight. When they arrived, the sprawling estate exuded an air of untouchable legacy. It wasn't just a home-it was an empire carved in stone and time.

Camila, the head housekeeper, greeted them at the door. "Welcome home,Ma'am. And welcome,Miss Lilly."

"Thank you, Camila. Show Lilly to her room and make sure she has everything she needs," Grandma Helen instructed.

Lilly followed Camila through the grand hallways,her footsteps muffled by the plush rugs. When they reached her room, she froze at the sight. The room wasn't just luxurious-it was familiar. Masculine details dominated the decor: deep mahogany furniture, muted tones, and shelves lined with books. “This.,. this was Alexander's room," Lilly said softly, her eyes sweeping over the space. "Yes, Miss," Camila confirmed.“Grandma Helen thought it would make you feel closer to him.” Lilly hesitated, her emotions a tumultuous storm. As she ran her fingers over the spines of the books, she tried to imagine a younger Alexander inhabiting this space. The thought sent an unexpected pang through her chest.


After a long bath, she rested until Camila returned to escort her to dinner.The meal was extravagant, with Grandma Helen ensuring Lilly sampled every dish. But the tension in Lilly's chest didn't fade, even as they strolled through the moonlit gardens afterward.

"It's so peaceful here," Lilly admitted,her voice soft.

Grandma Helen smiled knowingly. “Peace is a rare thing in our family, my dear. Cherish it while you can."


As they settled on a terrace overlooking the estate, Grandma Helen turned to Lilly,her expression serious.

"You'll meet Sandra soon," she began.

Lilly frowned.“Sandra?”

“Alexander's sister. She's studying abroad right now, but she's always been close to him."


The revelation surprised Lilly. "He's never mentioned her." Grandma Helen sighed, her gaze distant. "He's a man of secrets, that one.But there's more to him than what you've seen. This marriage may have started as a contract, but I see potential for something real." Lilly's heart ached at the truth in those words. She wanted to believethere was a chance, but Alexander's walls were formidable, his trust elusive. "Don't give up on him," Grandma Helen added softly."Sometimes,the strongest walls are built around the most fragile hearts."

At ONYX Corporation, Alexander sat in his office, the city sprawling below him like a chessboard, waiting for his next move.

"Repeat that," he demanded, his voice razor-sharp.

James swallowed hard. "The chauffeur reported that Grandma Helen refused to return Miss Evans until tomorrow evening.”

Alexander's eyes darkened, his fury simmering just beneath the surface.“Three days. She'll have her for three days."

James nodded hesitantly.

Alexander leaned back in his chair, the leather creaking under his weight.“What about the maid? The one feeding information to my grandmother?”

“We've identified her," James confirmed.

“Bring her to me.Now.”

Minutes later, Jackie, the chief bodyguard, dragged a trembling young woman into the office. She collapsed to her knees, herpleas spilling out in desperate sobs.
 
“Young mnaster, please, I had no choice! She forced me!" Alexander regarded her coldly, his silence more terrifying than any words.Finally, he leaned forward, his gaze locking onto hers. "You want forgiveness?" His voice was low, lethal. "You'll earn it. Go back to the mansion. Watch Miss Evans. Report to me if she even steps outside." The maid nodded frantically, her relief evident."Yes. young master. P'll do as you say."

Alexander dismissed her with a flick of his hand, his thoughts already elsewhere. This wasn't just about control-it was about understanding the pieces on the board.

Grandma Helen had made her move. Now it was his turn.


And he intended to win.
###Chapter 15

Earlier that morning. Lilly had risen before the sun. a quiet determination lighting herface. The idea had struck her during her conversation with Grandma Helen the previous night-an opportunity to express her gratitude and form a bond.


The mansion's kitchen buzzed with activity as the chef and Camila busied themselves, gathering the ingredients Lilly needed. She stood at the counter.sleeves rolled up, her focuis razor-sharp as she prepared Grandma Helen's favorite meal: a spread of vegetable salad, fish soup, rice, and a variety of side dishes.


"Are you sure you don't want us to handle this, Miss?" the chef asked.watching her wield the knife with surprising precision.

Lilly shook her head with a small smile. "No, thankyou. I want this to come from me."


The aroma of the meal filled the air, wafting through the halls and drawing curious glances from passing staff.

By the time she set the table, Grandma Helen walked into the dining area.her expression softening as her eyes landed on the carefully arranged dishes.


"Wow, you've been busy," Grandma Helen said, her surprise obvious. Lilly pulled out a chair for her. "Come, Grandma. It's your favorite. I hope I did it justice." Grandma Helen sat and took a tentative bite. Her eyes widened slightly,and then she smiled. "This is... remarkable. You made this?" Lilly nodded, watching her intently. "With the chef's help,of course."

"It's better than his cooking," Grandma Helen teased, her words loud enough for the chef to hear.


The poor man stiffened where he stood, a mixture of offense and despair flickering across his face.


Lilly chuckled, attempting to soothe the moment. "The meal yesterday was amazing. You're an excellent chef."


The chef nodded mutely, retreating with a hasty bow, and Grandma Helen laughed lightly.


They were mid-meal when Camila approached quietly and leaned down to whisper something in Grandma Helen's ear. The older woman's demeanor shifted slightly, her smile tightening.

"Excuse me, dear. I'll be back shortly," she said, rising from her seat.

Lilly nodded, watching her leave. She ate slowly, her thoughts wandering as soft murmurs echoed faintly from the hall. Minutes passed before Grandma Helen returned, her face calm but her movements brisk.

Lilly glanced toward the doorway where faint footsteps faded. Someone had come...and gone. After the meal, Grandma Helen led Lilly to a small art studio tucked away in the mansion. The scent of paint and varnish hung in the air, and the walls were adorned with breathtaking landscapes, many of them mountains. "You're so talented, Grandma!" Lilly exclaimed,awed as she watched the older woman's brush glide effortlessly across the canvas. The scene was
alive a mountain bathed in soft golden light. each detail painstakingly perfect.

Grandma Helen chuckled softly, her focus unwavering. "It's juast a hobby.dear.Nothing extraordinary."

Lilly shook her head."This is extraordinary. What mountain is it?"

"A place I visit for prayers," Grandma Helen replied, her tone thoughtful."It's special to me."


Lilly detected a subtle sadness in her words, an undercurrent of emotion she didn't quite understand.


"Can I join you the next time you go?" Lilly asked suddenly, surprising herself as much as Grandma Helen.


The older woman paused mid-stroke, her brush hovering over the canvas.She turned to Lilly, her expression unreadable. “Are you sure? It's not exactly a thrilling outing for someone your age."

"Thrilling isn't the point." Lilly replied, her voice soft but firm.“Sometimes.it's good to pray... especially for those we've lost."

Her chest tightened as the memory of her sisters surfaced, vivid and painful.She gripped the fabric of her dress to steady herself.

Grandma Helen's eyes softened, her gaze flickering to the scarves Lilly so often clung to. "The ones who owned those scarves?" Lilly blinked,startled. She hadn't realized how much Grandma Helen had observed. Slowly, she nodded, her voice barely above a whisper. "Yes." Grandma Helen didn't press further. Instead, she stood gracefully,her movements fluid as she gestured toward the door."You should rest. We'll be going out later, and I want you to come with me."

“Out?Where?"


"Shopping." Grandma Helen said with a smile,her mood brightening."It's been ages since I've gone, and I think it's time to spoil ourselves."

Lilly hesitated, but seeing the genuine excitement in the older woman's expression, she nodded. “Okay, Grandma."


The car pulled away from the estate later that afternoon, a sleek convoy with bodyguards trailing closely behind.

Grandma Helen sighed as she looked out the window. "My grandson is so overprotective. Look at this-guards for a simple shopping trip!"

Lilly smiled faintly, her mind flashing back to her grandfather. He had been just as vigilant, sending a small army of guards whenever she and her sisters ventured out. The memory was both comforting and bittersweet.

The car stopped in front of the most opulent mall Lily had ever seen. Its grand facade gleamed in the sunlight, and above the entrance, bold letters spelled out “ONYX Mall." She didn't need anyone to tell her it was part of the Kane family's empire.

As they stepped out of the car, all eyes turned toward them. The crowd parted instinctively, murmurs spreading as people speculated about their identities. The presence of the guards only heightened my curiosity. Some pulled out their phones, but the guards quickly intervened, ensuring no photos were taken. A man in a tailored suit hurried toward them, flanked by a group of shopping assistants. His demeanor was respectful yet eager as he bowed deeply.

"Mrs. Kane," he said, his voice reverent. "It's an honor to have you here.It's been such a long time since your last visit."


Grandma Helen smiled graciously, but her eyes gleamed with a sharpness that didn't escape Lilly's notice. “Let's hope the service here hasn't declined in my absence."

"Of course not, Ma'am. We'll ensure you have everything you need," the manager said quickly, gesturing for the assistants to follow them.


As they stepped inside, the weight of the moment pressed against Lilly's chest. The mall was a glittering showcase of wealth and power, but beneath its surface,something felt... off.

She couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching them, and the faint echo of footsteps trailed just a second too long behind.

The shopping trip had begun, but Lilly couldn't ignore the creeping sense of unease curling at the edges of her mind. Something or someone was waiting.
###Chapter 16

"Mmm.I would only need two shopping assistants since I'm not buying much; the rest can leave." Grandma Helen ordered,her voice calm yet authoritative.


The manager complied instantly, dismissing the additional staff and focusing solely on Mrs. Kane. However, his sharp eyes couldn't help but linger on the striking young lady accompanying her-a vision of understated elegance. Though her demeanor hinted at privilege,her identity eluded him, which was unusual for someone skilled at recognizing influential faces.


The shopping trip stretched on, with stops at several high-end stores.Gradually, Lilly noticed the items being selected weren't solely for Grandma Helen. By the third store, it became obvious: Grandma Helen was shopping for her as well.

"Grandma,you don't need to go to all this trouble for me," Lilly said softly.holding back her unease.

"Nonsense," Grandma Helen replied with a wave of her hand."You deserve it. After that delicious meal and your promise to join me in the mountains, this is the least I can do." Lilly smiled faintly but couldn't shake her discomfort. Later, when she excused herself to "use the restroom," her true purpose unfolded. She had spotted a jewelry store nearby and wanted to find a gift for Grandma Helen-something special to show her gratitude. Inside the jewelry store, her eyes wwere drawn to a stunning collection: a necklace, earrings, and bracelets that radiated timeless elegance. "How much for the set?" she asked.

"Altogether, it's $100,000," the salesperson replied.unfazed.

Lilly hesitated only briefly before reaching into her purse. Pulling out her black card. she placed it on the counter. She could feel the salesperson's gaze on her, shock evident in their widened eyes. It was rare to see such a card-reserved for the wealthiest elite worldwide.


"Is everything alright?" Lilly asked casually, though she already knew what had caused the reaction.


"Yes, ma'am, of course," the salesperson stammered, quickly processing the payment.


Lilly left the store with the gift carefully wrapped, her heart lighter. But the sense of peace didn't last. Her steps faltered when she saw someone walking toward the jewelry shop with two others. Her breath caught.


“Kate?”she whispered, panic seizing her. No. She's supposed to be in Europe!


Lilly turned sharply, pulling the hood of her coat higher over her head as she quickened her pace.


Kate, engrossed in conversation, suddenly paused. Something about the woman leaving the jewelry store struck her as familiar. The walk,the slight tilt of her head-it tugged at buried memories. "Amelia?"she whispered, her voicelow with disbelief. "Kate?"one of her friends asked, puzzled, as Kate stopped dead in her tracks. Kate didn't respond. Instead,she broke into a sprint. her gaze locked on the retreating figure.


Lilly's heart pounded as she weaved through the mall. her mind racing.She knew Kate well enough to sense the moment she was spotted. Her phone buzzed in her hand-Grandma Helen's name lighting up the screen but she silenced the call.

She ducked into another aisle, her eyes scanning for a clear path. The mall felt endless; its brightly lit stores were a maze she couldn't escape fast enough. The sound of hurried footsteps behind her scent a fresh wave of panic coursing through her veins.

Kate's eyes darted through the crowd, her mind warring between certainty and doubt. “It can't be her," she muttered under her breath. But the closer she got. the stronger her conviction grew.

“Amelia!"she called. her voice cracking.

Lilly flinched but didn't turn around. Instead, she darted into another corridor, slipping into the shadow of a pillar as Kate ran past,her gaze frantically scanning the throngs of shoppers.

By the time Kate slowed to a halt, she was breathless. Her chest heaved as her eyes swept the crowd again, but the figure she had been chasing was gone.

Her heart sank, her mind reeling. Was it her sister she'd just seen? Or had her imagination played a cruel trick on her? "Kate,what's wrong?" one of her friends finally caught up to her, placing a hand on her shoulder. Kate shook her head slowly, her gaze still searching the crowd."I thought I saw her," she murmured, her voice hollow.

“Who?”

"Amelia." Kate whispered, her throat tightening. "But.,, she's gone now."

For a moment, she stood frozen, torn between relief and despair. Could it have been a mistake? Or was the past she thought she had buried now rising to the surface?
###Chapter 17

Kate's heart was racing as she drove through the familiar streets toward the Blake family estate. The image of the woman she had seen at the mall wouldn't leave her mind. Every detail-her walk, her hair, the way she carried herself-screamed of her long-lost sister, Lilly.


Arriving at the imposing Blake mansion. Kate parked her luxury car hastily, nearly forgetting to shut the door. The grandeur of the estate.surrounded by lush greenery and guarded gates, was a stark reminder of the weight of her family's name and the power they wielded in Aurora City.


The head maid. Emily, greeted her at the entrance. "You're back early,Miss Kate."


"Where's my mother?" Kate asked, barely stopping.

"In the garden, Miss," Emily replied, watching curiously as Kate strode past without another word.


Kate reached the garden, finding Lady Bella pruning roses with a calm precision that belied the storm brewing in her daughter's chest.

"Mother!" Kate called her voice tight with urgency.

Lady Bella turned, arching a brow. "You're back so soon. What happened?  Kate glanced over her shoulder,ensuring no one was close enough to overhear.′′Weneed to talk. Alone," With a wave of her hand, Lady Bella dismissed the nearby maids."What is it, Kate?" she asked, her voice low, sensing the tension in her daughter. Kate stepped closer, her voice trembling with suppressed emotion. "I think I saw her, Mother. Lilly. At the mall."

Lady Bella froze, the pruning shears slipping slightly in her hand."Lilly?"she repeated,her tone sharp.


"Yes. I saw someone who looked exactly like her walking out of a jewelry store. I wasn't sure at first, but the way she walked, the side profile-it was her," Kate insisted.her voice rising.


Lady Bella's expression darkened, her mind racing. "Are you certain? It's been months, Kate. No one has seen or heard anything about her. The search turned up nothing."


"I'm not entirely sure," Kate admitted reluctantly, "but I know what I saw.We need to confirm it. I need you topull the CCTV footage from the mall."

Lady Bella frowned. "That's not our family's mall, Kate. I don't have direct access."


"Didn't you say the manager is an old friend? Call him. Make something up. I need to know if it was her," Kate pleaded.

Lady Bella hesitated, but the desperation in Kate's eyes pushed her into action. "Alright. I'll see what I can do."

Kate grabbed her mother's hand tightly. "Thank you. You know we can't let her reappear now. Not after everything we've done." Lady Bella nodded, her lips pressing into a thin line. "We won't let that happen. She wwon't ruin what we've worked so hard for." As Lady Bella made the call to her contact at the mall. Kate paced the garden, her mind consumed with possibilities, If it was Lilly, why had she resurfaced now? What had she been doing all these months? And more importantly, what did she know?


Meanwhile, in a sleek black car speeding through Aurora City, Lilly was typing furiously on her phone.

Lilly: I think Kate saw me.

Matthew responded first.

Matthew,Are you sure?

Lilly: She chased me through the mall. If she didn't suspect something.she wouldn't have done that.

Michael chimed in.

Michael: That's not good.

Lilly: I need you to handle it. Delete any footage from the mall's security system. She can't confirm it was me.

Matthew: You mean to hack into the Kane family mall's system?

Lilly: Yes. Do whatever it takes. They can't know I'm alive. Not yet.

Matthew with a thumbs-up emoji, followed by a smirking face.

Michael: You're playing with fire, Lilly. If they figure it out, they won't sit still. Lilly: Then I'll be ready. But until then, make sure theycan't trace me. Lilly smiled faintly at her screen before glancing out the window. Her moment of calm shattered when she realized Alexander,sitting beside her,had been silently watching her.

"Something amusing?" he asked, his tone neutral but his eyes piercing.

Caught off guard. Lilly quickly locked her phone. "Nothing important."

Alexander's gaze lingered on her for a moment before his phone rang. He answered without breaking eye contact.

"Grandma," he said, his voice softening slightly.

"I heard you took Lily from the mall," Grandma Helen said sharply. "I told you I'd bring her back tomorrow evening!"

Alexander's jaw tightened, but he said nothing.

"I bought things for her, and she got something for me too.Send your driver to pick them up. And Alexander," Grandma Helen's voice grew stern, "if you mistreat that girl, you'll regret it. She's my granddaughter-in-law, and even if your marriage doesn't last, she'll always be part of this family. Treat her well."

The call ended abruptly,leaving Alexander staring at his phone in silence.


Lilly glanced at him, wondering what was going through his mind.But his expression remained cold as ever.


***************Back at the Blake mansion, Lady Bella sat by the phone, tapping her manicured nails against the table as she waited for her contact to send the footage. Kate paced the room, her anxiety growing by the second. "What's taking so long?" "Patience," Bella said sharply.

When her phone finally pinged. Bella opened the files immediately.Together, they scrutinized the grainy footage of the jewelry store entrance.

Kate leaned closer to the screen, her breath hitchingas she spotted a figure in a simple yet elegant dress. Her heart pounded as she recognized the familiar profile.


"It's her." Kate whispered, her voice trembling with equal parts fury and disbelief.


Bella's lips thinned into a calculating smile. "So, she's back."

Kate's fists clenched at her sides. "She thinks she can return after all these years and disrupt everything. She has no idea what's waiting for her."

But as they continued to watch, the footage abruptly cut off, leaving the screen blank.


"What happened?" Kate demanded.

Bella's contact called a moment later, his voice apologetic. "The footage was wiped clean. Someone hacked into the system."

Kate's face twisted in frustration, her suspicions growing deeper. "She's smarter than we thought. But it doesn't matter. She can't hide forever."

Her gaze hardened, determination etched into her features. "If Lilly is back,I'll make sure she regrets it." Kate grasped her mother's hand tightly, her eyes burning with determination."Thanks, MIother. You know what's at stake. We can't let this opportunity slip away. We need to finish what we started." Bella nodded solemnly. "Yes. We need to.

Kate wasn't just any Blake-she was the iHlegitimate daughter of Bella.born from an affair with Daniel Blake while he was still married to Lifly's mother. Bella had fought to secure her place in the family,clawing her way to the top after Selina. Daniel's wife, had died. Despite the lingering whispers of society calling Bella a gold digger and Kate an illegitimate child,they had managed to carve out their position. But there was always one thing left undone-taking full control of the Blake family legacy. And Lilly's sudden reappearance could ruin everything.


**********


When the car finally pulled into the mansion, Lilly moved to get out,but Alexander's voice stopped her.


"Leave the gift," he said, his tone sharp. "It will be taken to my grandmother. You won't be going to the family house again."

Lilly froze her hand on the door handle. Her heart skipped a beat at the finality in his words. She dropped the gift onto the seat without another word and stepped out of the car.


But as the door closed behind her. Alexander's eyes drifted to the package.and curiosity flashed across his face. With a slow, deliberate motion,he picked it up. A small brow quirked as he examined it-an expensive jewel set. His eyes narrowed.

"Who paid for this?" he murmured under his breath, his mind already working.

Reaching for his phone, he dialed his assistant. "Yes,boss?" "Didn't I tell you to report any transactions made with the card I gave her?"he asked, his voice low with suspicion.

"Yes, sir, but there haven't been any transactions on her card."

Alexander paused, his grip tightening on the phone. "What do you mean there haven't been any transactions?"

The silence on the other end was palpable, and then the assistant's voice came back, uneasy. "I'm checking it now, sir. But there's no record of any purchases."


Alexander's jaw clenched. He looked at the expensive jewel in his hand and the growing suspicion in his gut. "Then whose money did she use to buy this?"


Lilly Evans was becoming more and more of a mystery with each passing day.
###Chapter 18

Bella paced anxiously around the grand living room, her heart pounding in her chest as she anxiously awaited the manager's call. The minutes dragged on endlessly, each tick of the clock sharpening her nerves. Kate.equally restless. sat on the edge of the couch, her fingers twitching as if to do something-anything-to push the time forward. She was desperate for answers, her mind racing with countless possibilities.

Finally. Bella's phone rang, cutting through the silence. Bella snatched it up immediately. Her voice was tight with expectation as she answered.

The call was brief, but it hit like a blow to the gut. Bella's face paled as she listened, her grip tightening around the phone until her knuckles turned white.


"What did he say?” Kate demanded, her eyes burning with impatience.

Bella's lips curled into a thin, forced smile as she ended the call, the weight of the news pressing heavily on her chest. “The footage... it's been deleted," she said. her voice almost a whisper.

Kate froze, her eyes wide in disbelief. “What? That's impossible. They're supposed to preserve it! How could it just disappear?"

Bella's eyes narrowed as she fought to keep her composure."It's gone.Kate. But don't worry... we still have ways to find out the truth."

Kate stood up, her face tight with frustration. "What doyou mean,'ways?"Her voice was sharp, filled with a desperate edge. "Tell me. I need to know. If that was really Lilly... I need to know. This can't be happening right now." Bella reached out and took her daughter's hand, squeezing it reassuringly."I have my methods. And if that girl dates to reappeat or make herself known again. I'll make sure she disappears once more-permanently.

"But Grandfather..." Kate hesitated. the words hanging in the aif like a heavy fog. "Grandfather is looking for her too. What if he finds her first?

Bella's expression darkened, her grip tightening."We will handle this.Kate. Before he does. Don't worry about him."

Kate's breath escaped in a shaky sigh. "All I want is to finally get what's mine...all that belongs to me."


Bella smiled coldly, pulling her daughter into a tight embrace. "And you will, darling. You'll have everything. When your father returns, we'll push forward. You'll join the family business, and one day, you'll be the one to lead the Blake legacy."


Kate's lips parted in a slow smile. "I can't wait, Mother."

Meanwhile. Lilly's life was anything but peaceful. After a long day,she slipped into her room, the soft hum of the mansion around her, and her mind weighed down with a million thoughts. As she undressed,her phone rang-Grandma Helen's name flashing across the screen.

Lilly answered quickly, her voice soft but warm. "Hello,Grandma."

"Oh, my dear," Grandma Helen's voice was full of affection."I received your gift.It's lovely, such a fine piece of jewelry. You've made me so happy.” "I'm so glad you like it, Grandma," Lilly said, smiling at the thought of her grandmother's reaction. There was a pause, and then Grandma Helen's tone shifted slightly."I hope my grandson gave you enough funds for it, dear. You didn't go overboard,did you?"

Lilly hesitated, then lied smoothly, "Of course. Grandma. He gave me more than enough. You don't have to worry about a thing."

"Good,good. I'm glad to hear it. Now, rest well, my dear. I'll see you soon...and we'll have more time together, I promise."

Lilly smiled softly at her grandmother's words. "Thank you, Grandma.I can't wait.”"


The call ended, and Lilly sat there, the warmth of the conversation still lingering. But before she could fully settle into the quiet, there was a soft knock at the door.


Opening it,she was greeted by Clara and two maids, all holding packages in their hands.


"What's all this?" Lilly asked, eyeing the gifts.

"These are from Mrs. Kane. Ma'am,” Clara explained. “Your belongings.and some additional gifts she selected for you.”


Lilly nodded and stepped aside to let them in. The maids carefully placed the packages on the couch, then bowed and left. Once the door closed, Lilly walked over and began unwrapping the items.She recognized a few things from her time with Grandma Helen during the shopping trip, but there were many other items she hadn't been present for. Each one seemed more extravagant than the last, and she couldn't help but feel a knot tighten in her stomach. As she pondered the significance of these gifts, her phone buzzed again. It was Sarah, checking in on the coffee shop. Lilly replied, her thoughts distracted by everything happening around her. With Alexander becoming more controlling by the day, she needed to make sure her business back in the city didn't fall apart.

Later that evening, Lilly descended the stairs for dinner, only to find Alexander still seated at the table. His presence was commanding, even in his quiet reading of the newspaper. She sat down next to him, but couldn't help stealing glances at him, her mind a swirl of conflicting emotions.

He noticed her gaze."What's wrong?”

Lilly quickly averted her eyes, flustered. “Nothing," she muttered.

"Sure about that?" he teased, his voice low and unsettling.

The meal passed in strained silence. Every bite, every movement felt deliberate, measured. But still, Lilly couldn't help but observe him, the way his fingers moved with such precision as he ate. The tension was palpable, and Lilly was caught at the moment, unsure of what to make of it.


After dinner, Alexander retreated to his study, leaving her behind. But Lilly lingered. She needed answers. As the house felt unusually still, she wandered the halls, confusion gnawing at her.

Finally, she approached Clara. "Where is everyone? Why is it so quiet today?” Clara glanced at her, a flicker of something unreadable in her eyes. "Today is a mandatory day off, Ma'am. Mr. Kane's orders." Lilly blinked in confusion. "A day off? I didn't know..." Clara seemed almost reluctant as she added. "Mr. Kane instructed me to send you to the family home today. Ma'am. It's time for you to go."

Lilly froze, her heart pounding. The family home? Alexander had explicitly told her she would never set foot there again. Why the sudden change?

"What's going on?" she whispered to herself.

Clara's face remained impassive. "The car is waiting for you outside."

Lilly's mind raced. This didn't feel right. The whole situation felt off. As she stood there, staring out the window, a shiver of unease crept down her spine.


Something was happening, something she couldn't quite understand yet.And she knew-deep down-that today would mark the beginning of something far more dangerous than she ever imagined.

The question lingered in her mind as she prepared to leave: What was Alexander planning?
###Chapter 19

Clara let out a heavy sigh, a flicker of unease crossing her face as she realized Alexander hadn't briefed her on the significance of today. This lack of knowledge would make her arrival at the family estate awkward and suspicious.

“Ma'am, today marks the anniversary of Alessandro Kane's passing,Alexander's father," Clara finally revealed, her voice tinged with hesitation.

Lilly blinked, the words sinking in with a sharp jolt. She frowned,bewilderment flicking across her face. Alexander hadn't mentioned this to her during the five days she'd been away. A bitter laugh escaped her lips before she could stop it. Why would he share something personal like this?Of course,he hadn't.

“Yes, ma'am. MIr. Kane must have overlooked telling you." Clara glanced away, a hint of discomfort glinting in her eyes as she carefully chose not to address Alexander's decision to send Lilly to the family estate without disclosing such an important detail.

“You said a driver is waiting outside?” Lilly asked a flicker of curiosity now intertwining with her confusion.

“Yes,ma'am.” Without waiting for further input, Lilly walked past Clara, her heels clicking softly on the floor. The cool night air greeted her as she stepped outside. The chauffeurstood respectfully by the car, a Stoic figure with unreadable eyes. Clara's voice stopped her one more time."Ma'am, you should change your clothes first. A memorial like this requires proper attire." Lilly glanced at her simple, casual dress, realizing that her attire was far too informal for such an occasion. She nodded silently and quickly turned back into the house.


She changed into a sleek, black, fitted dress that hugged her figure just right and fell gracefully below her knees. Paired with black heels and a tidy ponytail, she looked polished but solemn. She took a breath,steeling herself for whatever lay ahead.


Together, she and Clara finally headed to the family estate. The car ride was quiet, theair in the vehicle thick with an unspoken tension. The estate's grandeur loomed larger with every passing mile. As they approached a distant section of the property, Lilly spotted the shrine in the distance,guarded by stern figures standing tall.

The car stopped, and Lilly got out, the gravel path crunching softly beneath her heels. She entered the shrine, removing her shoes as a sense of reverence settled over her. Inside, she saw Grandma Helen kneeling before the portrait of Alessandro Kane, a woman of quiet resilience. The sight stirred something in Lilly-a mix of curiosity and compassion.


She quietly lit incense, bowing three times before the portrait before settling beside Grandma Helen, who was still deep in silent prayer. The atmosphere in the shrine felt sacred yet suffocating.

She glanced around the room and noticed that only the two of them were present. Sandra was away in Europe, but where was Alexander? Hle had arranged for her to come here-so why wasn't he standing alongside her? A chill ran down her spine as she closed her eyes and clasped her hands,praying for Alexander's father. But soon, her thoughts drifted to her sisters.and tears began to stream down her cheeks. After an hour, the prayers ended. Lilly stood alongside Grandma Helen.their heads bowed, a heavy sadness hanging between them. But Grandma Helen's eyes met Lilly's with a frailty that shook her resolve.


"This is the first time someone joined me for my son's memorial since Sandra left for Europe." Grandma Helen finally spoke, her voice barely a whisper.


Lilly looked up in surprise. "Are you saying that...?”

“Yes.”Grandma Helen's eyes glistened with unshed tears.

She took a trembling breath. "Why hasn't Alexander come to his father's memorial?”


Grandma Helen wiped a tear from her cheek, the lines on her face deepening with the weight of past sorrows. “Since Alessandro's death.Alexander has avoided this place. The shrine-it brings him too much pain.”


"How so?" Lilly's voice was barely audible.

Grandma Helen met her gaze with a deep, sorrowful look."His mother...she's the first person to cause his agony. She was a terrible wife and a terrible mother. Her infidelity led to Alessandro's death. Alexander found her with another man. In his grief and rage, Alessandro drove recklessly,leading to his fatal accident." Lilly's breath caught in her throat as the words hit her like a shockwave.The gravity of Grandma Helen's story settled over her, a painful revelation that made her own eyes fill with tears. "I'm so sorry for everything that happened," Lilly said softly, reaching out to embrace Grandma Helen. Grandma Helen looked up, her eyes searching Lilly's face with a vulnerable trust. "You're not like his mother, and I believe you won't make the same mistake. But if you want this marriage to endure beyond one year and five months, you'll need to show Alexander you're different.Truly different."


She paused, the intensity of her words sinking in.66It5Ss not about money.or status, or power. It's about something deeper. Loyalty.Commitment.Love.”"


After a long, quiet moment, they laid flowers and burned incense at Alessandro Kane's grave and that of Nicholas Kane, Alexander's recently departed grandfather. But there was still no sign of Alexander's mother.The absence of a grave made Lilly wonder if she was still alive and, if so.why Alexander kept her hidden from the family.

She glanced around the tombs, a sense of mystery gnawing at her.

Returning home to an eerily empty house, Lilly tried to process everything she had learned. The revelationabout Alexander's mother and the deep emotional wounds it caused him stirred memories of her strained relationship with her father.


She went upstairs, the exhaustion of the day settling into her bones. After a long, hot bath, she lay down in bed, every nerve on edge.

Suddenly, a sound-a soft creak-shattered the silence. Her eyes flew open,her heart pounding in her chest. The guards were supposed to be outside.She was alone except for the guards beyond the house walls. She cautiously stepped out of bed, every shadow in the room now a potential threat. The door opened slowly. In the dim hallway light. Alexander stumbled in.disheveled, his face flushed with alcohol. The stench of whiskey clung to him.


He leaned heavily on the doorframe, his eyes glassy but still filled with an unsettling intensity.


Lilly rushed to steady him as he swayed, his towering presence disoriented but no less formidable.


“Alexander,what's going on? You've been drinking?" she asked, a mix of fear and confusion in her voice.


He pulled her into a wobbly embrace, his breath hot against her ear."Shhh... let's just... sleep," he muttered, barely coherent.

She tried to push him away, every instinct telling her this was dangerous.


But his grip tightened, and in his embrace, Lilly felt the precarious boundary between love and dominance blur.

She looked into his eyes, determined to find something-anything-that might give her insight into Alexander's true self.


Her thoughts swirled into questions that would remain unanswered.Why was he here? What would happen if he woke up sober? The answers were slipping through her fingers, but one thing was clear:whatever she thought she knew about Alexander, about love, loyalty,and trust-it was all about to change. With the night closing in and Alexander's presence overwhelming, Lilly felt a chill settle in her chest.Once she was sure he was asleep, she carefully extricated herself from his grip and helped him change into more comfortable clothing. She felt a flush at the sight of him, wondering how he could fit inside her.

After cleaning him up, she lay down on the other side of the bed, turned off the light, and settled in. Before long, he turned towards her and pulled her into his arms, holding her close as he slept peacefully.

When he awoke and saw them in this intimate position, things would surely become complicated.


She knew one thing-this was just the beginning.
###Chapter 20

Lilly woke up to the sharp scent of cologne mingling with the lingering traces of alcohol. Her eyes fluttered open, and she found herself face-to-face with a storm-an irate Alexander Kane, his intense gaze fixed on her like a blade ready to strike.

"Good mor-"


"Save it," he growled, cutting her off with a venomous edge. His voice was tight and controlled, but his eyes burned with fury. "Let last night be the first and last time you change my clothes. Understand?"


Lilly's pulse quickened. She wasn't sure what shocked her more: his anger or the inexplicable tension curling between them. She was caught off-guard,her words stumbling out. unfiltered. "It wouldn't have happened if you hadn't come home drunk, Mr. Kane."


"Don't push me." His jaw clenched, and he turned toward the door,but Lilly, her hand trembling slightly, reached out to grab his arm.

He froze, his sharp gaze flicking down to where her fingers had curled around his sleeve."What is it?" His voice was low, almost dangerous.

"Alexander, I..." Her breath caught in her throat, unsure of how to make him understand. "I just want to say... I'm here for you. Even if our marriage is temporary, if you need to talk, I'm here. You don't have to bottle everything up and drown it in alcohol."

His eyes narrowed unreadable, dark pools that made her feel as if she were standing at the edge of a precipice. He didn't move for a moment, the silence suffocating. Then, with a sharp exhale, he pulled his arm away and gave her a cold, final look. "I've been warned," he muttered, his voice as sharp as a knife, before turning and walking out without another word.

Lilly remained rooted in place, her heart thundering in her chest. She felt the sharp sting of his rejection-familiar, yet so much more intense than anything she'd experienced before. She was left alone, the air thick with unanswered questions and a growing ache for the man she couldn't quite understand.


***************

By the time Lilly arrived at the coffee shop later that morning, she was barely able to mask the storm of emotions swirling inside her. Sarah noticed her tense posture immediately.


"Good morning, stranger!" Sarah called out, her voice warm, but Lilly could hear the concern beneath it.

"Look who's here!" Sarah exclaimed, hustling over to Lilly and leading her into the storeroom where she was about to change. "You didn't call yesterday.What happened?"

Lilly exhaled slowly, her mind still reeling from the morning's events. "I'm sorry. I had to go to the Kane family residence."


"Really?" Sarah raised an eyebrow. "I thought he said you'd never go there.What changed?"


Lilly's expression hardened as she recalled the solemn day. "It was his father's anniversary of death. He sent me to be with his grandmother...and I found out something I wasn't expecting."

Sarah's curiosity was piqued. "What did you find out?"

Lilly hesitated, then spoke in a low, measured voice, as if still processing everything. "Hlis mother... she was unfaithful. It led to his father's death.Alexander found them together, and his father died in a reckless accident afterward."


Sarah's face went pale. Her lips parted, but no words came out at first.Finally, she gasped, "Oh my god... With a mother like that, no wonder he's wary of women."

Lilly nodded, the weight of the revelation heavy on her chest. "I hope he changes," she whispered, though her voice lacked conviction.

The two of them remained in silence for a moment before Lilly's stomach turned uncomfortably. The smell of coffee, usually her favorite scent, now made her feel queasy. She rushed to the restroom, her head spinning.


Once inside, she barely made it to the sink before she doubled over, her body rejecting everything she had eaten that morning. Her hands trembled as she wiped her mouth, staring at her pale reflection in the mirror.

Something was wrong.


Sarah knocked gently on the door, concern lacing her voice. "What's wrong?"


"I think I'm pregnant," Lilly saíd, her voice barely above a whisper,the words sinking into her like a weight she couldn't escape.

"Are you sure?" Sarah's voice was tentative.

Lilly's heart raced as she mentally calculated her period. It was late. "I was supposed to get my period yesterday, and now I'm throwing up."

Without another word, Sarah rushed out, returning with a test strip. Lilly used it, her hands shaking. The seconds stretched into an eternity before the two lines appeared.

"So?" Sarah asked her voice tight with anticipation.

Lilly looked down at the strip and felt her stomach twist. "I'm pregnant."


Sarah didn't hesitate. She rushed forward and enveloped Lilly in a tight hug."Congratulations!" she said, her voice warm and excited,but Lilly could only nod numbly.


The news felt like a double-edged sword-joy and fear swirling inside her,both equally overwhelming. Would Alexander push her away now that she was pregnant? The thought made her heart ache with uncertainty.

Later,Lilly arrives at the Kane family residence, her mind still reeling from the pregnancy revelation. Camila greeted her warmly, leading her to Grandma Helen, who was sitting in the upstairs living room, flipping through a photo album.

"Grandma," Lilly greeted, her voice soft with respect.

Grandma Helen smiled and gestured for her to sit."I've been going through some old photos. Would you like to see pictures of Alexander when he was younger?"

 
Lilly smiled, her curiosity piqued. "Yes, I'd lovre to." The two women spent the next hour flipping through the pages,laughing at the innocent, carefree photos of Alexander as a child. But Lilly couldn't ignore the shift that occurred when they reached the photos from when he was fourteen. That was the age his father had died, and Lilly could see the unmistakable change in his expression-a loss so deep it was still etched in his features. Grandma Helen's voice brought her back to the present. "Really? You're pregnant?" Her eyes lit up with genuine joy, and for a moment. Lilly felt a warmth that she hadn't expected.

"Yes," Lilly said, her heart heavy with the weight of her newvs. "But I still need to confirm it with a doctor."


"I'm so happy for you, dear. I can't wait to be a great-grandmother,"Grandma Helen said, enveloping Lilly in a hug.


Lilly felt a strange pang of uncertainty. "He knows?" she asked, her voice soft.


"I'll tell him when you get home," Grandma Helen assured her.

Lilly nodded, but something gnawed at her. She didn't know what would happen next-only Alexander could decide whether she would stay in his life after their contract ended. That thought hung over her as she reluctantly left, accepting the chauffeur's offer for safety.

At home, Lilly was greeted by Clara and another maid. "Thank you, Clara."

"Would you like something to eat, ma'am?" Clara asked, her tone polite.but Lilly's mind was elsewhere.

"No, I've already eaten," Lilly murmured. "I'll retire for the night."

"Good night,ma'am." She used the elevator to avoid the stairs, her steps heavy as she approached the bedroom. The door creaked open, and there he was-Alexander, seated on the edge of the bed, his gaze icy,his presence suffocating. "Why did you go to the family house?" His voice was cold.cutting through the silence like a blade.

Lilly's heart raced. "To visit Grandma and see how she's doing."

"I don't recall giving you permission."

Lilly's pulse quickened, but she stood her ground. "Didn't,know I needed to ask."


His face darkened, and she could feel the tension crackling between them."Just because I sent you there yesterday doesn't mean you can go whenever you want. You are not to develop any relationship with my family.When our one-year and six months are up, you're out. Understand?"

Her chest tightened, but she forced herself to remain calm. "You've made that clear.But my relationship with your grandmother has nothing to do with our arrangement. I care for her."


Lilly turned to leave for her room, but he blocked the door with a single step. "Where do you think you're going?"

"To my former room."

"No,you're not. Not until you're pregnant."


Her breath hitched. "I am pregnant."

His eyes darkened, and the words he spoke next held a dangerous weight.
"Why didn't you tell me?" The room fell silent, the tension unbearable. Lilly swallowed,trying to steady herself."Ijust found out today." "Can I go now?"


Alexander's gaze flicked to the suitcase in her hand. He didn't move, but his silence was like a trap closing in.


Lilly took a step forward, but then his hand shot out,gripping her wrist with a force that sent a shock through her body.


"What are you doing?" she asked, her voice trembling.

"Don't leave."


The words echoed in the silence of the room, and Lilly stood frozen,the weight of his touch grounding her in place. Was this a warning-or something else entirely?
###Chapter 21

Had she heard him right? Lilly's breath caught in her throat, her heart hammering in disbelief. Alexander Kane, the man who rarely revealed a crack in his icy exterior, had just said thie unthinkable.

"Don't leave," he had said.


The words hung in the air like a storm cloud, ominous and laden with meaning. She blinked, her voice faltering as she tried to confirm what she thought she'd heard. "What did you say?"

Alexander's expression didn't soften. His gaze was a fortress, locked down and impenetrable. "Have you been to the hospital?" he asked instead,his tone cold and detached.

Lilly shook her head."No."

His jaw clenched slightly, a flicker of emotion breaking through the calm facade. "Put that luggage down," he ordered, his voice steely. "You're not leaving this room until a doctor confirms you're pregnant."

And with that, he walked out, leaving her standing there in stunned silence.

The room felt suffocating in his absence. Did he not trust her? Did he believe she'd lie about something as monumental as this? Lilly's hands gripped the handle of her suitcase tightly. Her emotions were a tempest-confusion, anger, and hurt swirling together in achaotic storm.
****************
The next morning, Lilly woke up with renewed resolve. Alexander might control many things, but he wouldn't dictate her every move. Dressing for work, she chose a sleek gray fitted shirt dress. It was modest yet stylish.stopping just above her knees. The touch of small heels completed her look-confident and professional, a statement of her independence.

She descended the staircase, expecting the quiet hum of her usual morning routine. Instead, she was met with tension so thick it could choke the air.

Alexander sat at the breakfast table, documents spread before him, his eyes scanning them with a laser focus. His presence dominated the room, but it was the man standing beside him-James, his assistant-that caught her attention. The poor man looked as though he might pass out from fear.

Lilly hesitated,suddenly aware of the charged atmosphere. Maybe she should grab a bite at work instead.


"Sit down," Alexander's voice cut through her thoughts like a whip.

She froze mid-step, unsure if she'd even been noticed. Slowly,she obeyed.taking a seat opposite him. The maids brought her breakfast-eggs,toast,and juice-but the air remained heavy.

For ten minutes, Alexander didn't acknowledge her presence, his attention locked on his documents. James shifted nervously, every small movement betraying his discomfort. Lilly couldn't stand the oppressive silence.

"James," she whispered, offering a small smile. "Breathe."

James gave her a shaky nod, his pale complexion doing little to ease her concern. But her moment of kindness drew Alexander's attention. He glanced up,his eyes cold as steel. "You better eat your breakfast and mind your own business," he said, his voice cutting through the room like a blade."And once you're done, go upstairs and change into something more appropriate. Lilly blinked, taken aback. "Excuse me?"

Alexander's gaze dropped briefly to her dress, then back to her face. "You heard me."


Lilly glanced down at her outfit. The gray dress was elegant, professional.and one of the expensive pieces Alexander had bought for her. There was nothing inappropriate about it.


"Mr. Kane," she began. carefully controlling her tone, "this is one of the clothes you purchased for me. There's nothing wrong with it."

Instead of addressing her, Alexander turned his anger on James, who looked as if he might faint. "Why were such clothes included in the purchase?"


James stammered, his words barely audible. "Sir, you instructed me to take a female employee with a similar body type to shop for MIs. Evans' clothes.She selected everything. I only carried the items."

"Fire her." Alexander ordered sharply, his tone like ice.

"Sir,I-"


"Immediately," Alexander snapped, silencing any protest. Lilly's jaw tightened, her sympathy for the unknown employee mixing with her mounting frustration. The dress might be shorter than Alexander preferred, but firing someone over it was absurd. The sound of documents slamming onto the table jolted her from her thoughts. Alexander leaned back in his chair, glaring at James. "Take these away and have them redone. I want them on my desk by the time I arrive at the office."


James grabbed the papers and fled the room without another word,leaving Lilly and Alexander alone in the thick, suffocating silence.

"Didn't I tell you to change that dress?" Alexander said. his gaze now fixed on her.


Lilly met his eyes, her frustration bubbling over. "Mr. Kane, there's nothing wrong with this dress, and firing someone who was only following orders is unreasonable."


His jaw tightened. "As long as you're in my house and carrying my child,you won't wear whatever you please."


His words were a match to dry tinder. "Didn't you say you need confirmation before believing I'm pregnant?" she snapped, her anger boiling to the surface.


"Yes," he replied coolly. "Which is why we're going to the hospital as soon as you change that dress."


Her heart pounded, anger fueling her defiance. "No one knows I'm your wife, or that I might be carrying your child. So why are you so bothered by what I wear?"


Alexander leaned forward, his eyes burning into hers. "Because I said so." His tone was final, his gaze searing, but Lilly refused to back down. "Fine," she spat, standing abruptly. Her chair scraped loudly against the floor,echoing her frustration.′′I′Il change. But this is ridiculous." She stormed out of the room, her heels clicking angrily against the floor.

Alexander watched her go, his expression unreadable. The fire in her eyes had sparked something in him-something he couldn't quite place. But one thing was certain: Lilly Evans was no ordinary woman.

As the door slammed shut behind her. Alexander leaned back in his chair,his thoughts swirling. This wasn't just about the dress. It was about control-a control that seemed to be slipping through his fingers with every step Lilly took.
###Chapter 22

Lilly sighed. exhausted by the constant battle of wills with Alexander. If she wanted to leave the house today, there was no point in dragging this out further. Standing up. she made her way to the elevator. her frustration simmering just beneath the surface.

In her room, she chose a loose red dress that brushed just above her knees,its flowing fabric both modest and elegant. She paired it with dark,low-heeled shoes and slung a black bag over her shoulder. Letting her long.blonde hair cascade down her back, she cast one last look in the mirror.She looked radiant, poised-ready for whatever storm awaited.

When she returned downstairs, a maid informed her that Alexander was waiting in the car. She braced herself as she stepped outside. The moment she slid into the passenger seat, his piercing gaze swept over her. It was brief, but the tension was palpable. He gave a subtle nod of approval.though his silence spoke volumes.


They arrived at Highland Hospital, its sterile halls buzzing with activity.The elevator ride to the Obstetrics and Gynecology department was thick with unspoken words. Lilly glanced at Alexander, his stoic expression betraying none of his thoughts.


The door to Dr. Richard's office opened, and he greeted her with a warm hug. "Nice to see you again, Ms. Evans."


Lilly returned the gesture with a polite smile. "Same here." Richard studied her for a moment, his gaze curious. "You look... different." "Mm-hmm," Lilly replied, keeping her tone light. "So," Richard turned toward Alexander, his curiosity piqued, "what's the good news? You were rather cryptic when you called."

Alexander,sitting on the couch with his legs crossed, didn't bother to respond. His silence was a wall.

Lilly,tired of the games, took the lead. "I'm pregnant," she announced,her voice steady.


Richard's face lit up with genuine excitement. "Wow! Congratulations to you both!" He hugged Lilly again, his enthusiasm infectious. "The man of steel is going to be a father. Who would've thought?"

"Thank you," Lilly said softly, glancing at Alexander. His eyes were on her,sharp and calculatinng, as though searching for cracks in her calm demeanor.


"I'll have one of the female doctors run all the necessary tests and bring me the results," Alexander interjected, his tone clipped and authoritative.

"Of course," Richard replied, undeterred by Alexander's brusqueness. "Come on, Lilly. Let me introduce you to the doctor who'll be taking care of you throughout your pregnancy."

Dr. Elena's office was warm and inviting, a stark contrast to the tension Lilly had been carrying. As they entered, Elena ended a phone call and turned toward them with a bright smile.

"Hey, Richard," she greeted, giving him a quick peck on the lips. Lilly's eyebrows lifted slightly. The gesture didn't escape her notice.
"And who is this?" Elena asked, her gaze landing on Lilly with a mix of curiosity and admiration.
"Alexander's wife, Lilly Evans," Richard introduced smoothly.

Elena's smile widened as she crossed the room to take Lilly's hands. "I'm so pleased to finally meet you. Richard has told me a lot about you."

"Nice to meet you too," Lilly replied warmly.

"Elena is not just a doctor," Richard added with a proud smile. "She's also my girlfriend."


Lilly's lips curved into a knowing smile. "I had a feeling. You make a lovely couple."

"Thank you," Elena said, her cheeks flushing slightly. "I hope we can be friends too, apart from me being your doctor."

"Of course," Lilly agreed, lking Elena's easygoing nature.

Just as they were settling in, Elena received an emergency call. Apologizing,she promised to return shortly and left in a hurry.

As they waited, Richard leaned back, his demeanor relaxed. "So, Lilly, tell me about yourself. Alexander never shares anything personal."

Lilly hesitated briefly but decided to share a sanitized version of her past."I grew up an orphan, mostly alone. I own a small coffee shop now, and I only completed high school," she said, glossing over the finer details of her life. Richard raised an eyebrow. "You carry yourself with a grace and confidence that suggests otherwise. You could easily pass for someone with a prestigious education." Lilly smiled faintly. In truth, she held two master's degrees, but this wasn't the moment to reveal her secrets.

"And there's something... unique about you," Richard added, studying her closely. "You have an aura, like someone born into privilege."

"That's thanks to hard work," she replied smoothly.


Richard chuckled, clearly impressed. But Lilly wasn't done probing. "Since you're one of Alexander's closest friends, I assume you know about his father's memorial two days ago?"

"Yes," Richard said, his expression darkening slightly.

"HIe wasn't there. His grandmother told me why," Lilly said cautiously.

Richard's shoulders tensed. "He never attends. The memories are too painful."


"Was his mother there?" Lilly asked, testing the waters.

"She's deadto him," Richard replied curtly.

The finality in his tone hinted at deep scars, but Lilly wasn't ready to let it go. "Is it true that his mother was the reason for his father's death?"

"That's what everyone believes," Richard admitted, his voice quieter now.

"But there's more, isn't there?" Lilly pressed, her intuition sharpening.

Richard's gaze met hers, a flicker of something dark crossing his features. He leaned forward, his voice dropping to a near-whisper. "Yes. Nine years ago, Alexander gave love a chance." Lilly's breath hitched. The weight of those words settled over her, heavy and foreboding. Before she could ask more, a shadow seemed to pass over Richard's face, his expression unreadable.
###Chapter 23

"Are you saying Alexander once loved someone?" Lilly's voice was low.steady,yet tinged with disbelief.

Richard nodded, his expression darkening.(4)YeS,and she became the second reason he shut himself off from relationships. First, it was his mother. Then,it was...her."

Lilly leaned forward, her curiosity piqued.“Her?”

Richard's gaze grew distant as though he were reliving memories he would rather forget. "She was the woman he loved when he was 21. Back then, he was just a young man with big dreams, building his company from scratch. They met in college. Alexander gave love a chance, truly believing in it. He cared for her deeply, perhaps too deeply. But she betrayed him. And then, karma struck swiftly."

"Karma?" Lilly echoed, her intrigue deepening. “What do you mean by that?”


Richard hesitated, his jaw tightening before he spoke. "She fled with someone else. Took everything she could from him. But fate...fate had other plans. The private jet she escaped on? It crashed."

Lilly's breath hitched, the weight of his words settling over her like a heavy cloud. "So that's why he's like this," she murmured. Richard nodded gravely,"It's why he harbors such bitterness toward women. Why he vowed never to marry-until his grandfather's will forced his hand." The ride back home was a blur for Lilly. Her mind replayed Richard's words, trying to piece together the fragments of Alexander's past. Could that betrayal still haunt him after all these years?

At the hospital, the tests confirmed she was three weeks pregnant.Alexander, as expected, was swift and firm in his decisions.“You'll stop working until after the baby is born," he announced curtly, barely allowing her a moment to protest.

By the time she returned home, her thoughts had only deepened.She called Sarah to inform her about the work hiatus and reached out to Matthew and Michael to check on their investigation. Both assured her that progress was being made, with significant findings expected soon.

Later that afternoon, Lilly was startled awake by a knock on her door.Groggily, she got up and opened it to find Clara and a guard standing outside, thelatter carrying two large boxes.

"What's this?" Lilly asked, stepping aside to let them in.

“The boss sent these for you," Clara replied.

“And what's inside?"

"Luxury items," the guard explained without offering further details.

After they left, Lilly examnined the contents. Inside the boxes were meticulously chosen items: a pair of elegant heels, a limited-edition purse,and a stunning silver gown that shimmered under the light. The craftsmanship spoke of extravagance. Her phone buzzed, and Alexander's name flashed on the screen. “I assume you've seen the dress and other items," he said without preamble. "Be ready by 7 PM. The chauffeur will pick you up." "Where are we going?" Lilly asked, her tone wary.

"You'll see," hereplied before hanging up.


By 6:30 PM, Lilly was dressed in the silver gown, her makeup light yet flawless,her long hair cascading down her back. When Clara informed her that the chauffeur had arrived, she headed outside, where a luxury Bentley Mulsanne awaited her.


The drive was quiet, the city's lights casting fleeting shadows across her face."Where are we going, Frank?" she asked the chauffeur, trying to ease her unease.


“To Kane's 10-star hotel, ma'am,” he replied, his voice neutral.


The answer only heightened her curiosity-and her apprehension.

The hotel was breathtaking, every detail exuding opulence. As they parked in the underground garage, two bodyguards escorted Lilly to an exclusive restaurant within the hotel. She felt her heart race as she entered. The ambiance was luxuious, every detail curated for the elite.

At a table in the far corner sat Alexander. He glanced up from his phone.his expression as unreadable as ever. As Lilly approached, she felt the weight of countless eyes on her. She had always been confident, but here,surrounded by the most powerful and wealthy individuals in the country,she felt an unusual nervousness. Alexander stood as she reached the table and pulled out a chair for her.“It suits you," he said simply, his gaze lingering on her. "Why are we here?" she asked, trying to suppress the tension in her voice. "Look around," he replied, gesturing subtly. Lilly glanced around and noticed people whispering and sneaking glances in their direction. "I see people watching us. Is that why you brought me here?"


Before Alexander could answer, a waiter arrived, and they placed their orders.


As they ate, Lilly couldn't shake the feeling that Alexander was watching her more than usual. When she finally looked up, she caught hs intense gaze.


"Is there something on my face?" she asked, touching her cheek self-consciously.


For a moment, she thought she heard a soft chuckle-low and almost imperceptible. But when she looked again, Alexander's face was as impassive as ever.

She sighed, returning her attention to her food. Yet unease clung to her,gnawing at her resolve. She glanced around the room, her eyes darting over the crowd. Everyone seemed absorbed in their own conversations,yet she couldn't shake the sense that something was amiss.

"What is it?" Alexander's voice cut through her thoughts.

Lilly hesitated, unsure how to explain.“Can we...leave?"

Alexander studied her, his piercing gaze searching hers for an answer."Why do you want to leave?” Before she could respond, a voice broke through the hum of the restaurant,freezing her in place.
 
 “Lilly.” Her blood ran cold. That voice-she knew it. Slowly. almost unwillingly.she turned.


"Albert?" Her voice was barely above a whisper, her hands gripping the table as her world threatened to tilt.
###Chapter 24

The world is vast, but moments like this make it feel suffocatingly small.

"Albent?" Lilly's voice was barely audible, her heart racing as she faced the man from her past.

"Lilly, it's really you." Albert said with a charming smile: his eyes alight with recognition.


"What are you doing here?" she asked, her voice steady despite the storm brewing inside her.


Albert leaned in slightly, his tone casual but tinged with amusement."Wondering why I'm here? I came to expand the family business and hoped to cross paths with you."


Lilly blinked, startled by the bluntness of his response. Their paths had diverged three years ago when she ended their brief relationship abroad.She had thought she'd left that part of her life behind.


"Oh," was all she could manage, though she could feel the intensity of Alexander's gaze burning into her. Against her better judgment, she glanced his way and regretted it instantly. Hisface was a mask of fury,his jaw clenched in barely restrained anger.


Albert followed her gaze, his expression shifting as he noticed the man sitting across from her. Recognition dawned, and his smile faltered."Alexander Kane," he muttered, just loud enough for her to hear. Albert extended a hand with calculated politeness. "Mr. Kane,it's an honor. I'm Albert Smith." Alexander's cold stare didn't waver, and he made no move to shake Albert's hand. The awkward silence that followed was suffocating.Albert,reading the situation quickly, withdrew his hand. Few men dared appronch Alexander Kane without facing consequences,and Albert had just realized the risk he had taken.

Lilly's mind raced, panic bubbling under her composed exterior.She prayed Albert wouldn't dig deeper. During their time together abroad,she had been "Lilly Evans," a false identity she and her sister adopted to escape the scrutiny tied to their real surname, Blake. The truth had been buried beneath layers of secrecy, and she had every intention of keeping it that way.


Albert's attention shifted back to Lilly, his gaze softening. "Let's catch up sometime," he said, offering her his business card.

Lilly hesitated but accepted it, knowing she might need to control the situation if he pursued her. Albert seemed to notice Alexander's unyielding glare, the air around them thick with unspoken tension. With a polite nod, he excused himself.

Once Albert was gone, silence settled over the table, oppressive and heavy.Alexander's piercing gaze remained locked on her, and Lilly fet as though she were being dissected under his scrutiny.

Finally,Alexander stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor.“Stand up," he commanded, his tone icy.

"What?" Lilly stammered, startled by his sudden movement. “Stand.Up.” She obeyed without question, her pulse quickening. Without another word,he grabbed her hand, his grip firm as he pulled her along. "Why are you dragging me?" she asked, struggling to keep up with his long strides.

"You wanted to leave. We're leaving," he said curtly, his tone brooking no argument.


"Do you have to drag me?"

He didn't answer, his focus fixed straight ahead. They reached the ground floor in a blur, and Lilly noticed how everyone avoided even glancing their way. Alexander Kane commanded fear and respect wherever he went, and this moment was no exception.


In the underground garage, Lilly yanked her hand free, her voice rising."Let go of me!"

Alexander stopped abruptly, turning to face her. His eyes blazed with an intensity that made her take a step back. "Get in the car," he ordered, his tone cold as ice.


She hesitated, but the sharp edge in his voice left no room for debate.Reluctantly, she climbed into the car, Alexander following close behind.


As the vehicle sped away, the silence inside was suffocating. Lilly stared out the window, her heart pounding.


"Hand it over," Alexander said suddenly, breaking the quiet.

“What?” “His contact details.” Lilly turned to him, confused. "Why do you want it?" “Don't make me repeat myself," he warned, his voice low and dangerous. With trembling fingers, Lilly pulled the business card from her clutch and handed it to him. Alexander barely glanced at it before rolling down the window and tossing it into the night.


"What was that for?" Lilly demanded, her voice rising in disbelief.

"How do you know him?" Alexander asked, his tone sharp.

“That's not an answer to my question," she shot back,frustration bubbling to the surface.


“Don't test my patience,Lilly.”

She hesitated,realizing how precarious her position was. "He's... an old friend.”


Alexander's eyes narrowed. "An old friend? This is his first time in the country. How did you know him before now?”

Lilly's heart sank. He knew. Of course, he knew. Alexander Kane never moved without gathering information first. The realization hit her like a wave-he must have had Albert investigated the moment he left the table.

"The thing is..." Lilly began, struggling to find the right words.

"Lilly Evans," Alexander interrupted, his voice dangerously low.“Start talking.” Her throat went dry. She was trapped, and she knew it. She couldn't reveal the truth about her past without risking everything. But lying to Alexander Kane was just as perilous. Every second of silence felt like an eternity. She met his gaze, his cold eyes demanding answers, and knew there was no escape. “I...”Her voice faltered, the weight of his stare crushing her resolve.

She had never felt so exposed, so vulnerable. How could she untangle this web without it unraveling everything she had worked so hard to keep hidden?


The car sped through the darkened streets, but Lilly could only hear the pounding of her own heart. The truth loomed over her, threatening to shatter everything she'd built.
###Chapter 25

It she lied, he would uncover it. If she told the whole truth, everything she had carefully hidden would unravel. The only path left was the treacherous middle ground.


Lilly swallowed hard and said. "He's not just a friend. He wasm my former lover."


The tension in the car snapped like a taut wire. Alexander's expression darkened immediately. "Pull over."

The driver obeyed without question, bringing the car to a halt on an isolated road. The escort vehicles following behind stopped as well. Both the driver and James, Alexander's right-hand man, exited the car silently and climbed into one of the other vehicles, leaving the two of them alone.

Lilly's pulse quickened. The abrupt stop, the oppressive silence-something about the situation felt dangerously volatile. "Why are we stopping?" she asked, her voice trembling.

Alexander's gaze bore into her."When you say he was your ex, do you mean he was your boyfriend?"

"Yes,"she admitted.

“And how," Alexander asked coldly, "could you have had a relationship with him if this is his first time in Country A?" Lilly hesitated, the weight of his question pressing down on her. There was no point denying it further. “Because I traveled to another country before," she confessed. His hand shot out, gripping hers with a force that made her wince.“You visited Country C?"

"Yes," she said through gritted teeth, trying to pull away."Let go of me!"

His grip tightened before loosening slightly, his dark eyes studying her intently. “You need to explain why you went to Country C and why you hid it from me."

"I don't owe you an explanation," she snapped, defiance flaring despite her fear.


Alexander's jaw clenched. "When we married, I had you investigated thoroughly. Nothing about a trip to Country C came up. You'd better start talking, Lilly, or you'll face the consequences."

She met his gaze with a mix of defiance and desperation. "The contract we signed specifies that you're not to interfere in my personal matters, just as I don't interfere in yours.”


"Not when it's something I need to know," he growled, his voice like a blade slicing through the tense air. “Especially since he was your first."

Lilly flinched at the mention of her past, the unspoken accusation hanging heavy between them. “You're hurting me," she said quietly.

His grip loosened, and for a moment, something unspoken flickered in his eyes before he turned away. Without another word, he signaled for the driver and James to return, and the car resumed its journey. The rest of the drive was cloaked in icy silence. When they finally reached the mansion, Lilly climbed out and stormed inside, her anger simmering beneath the surface. Clara greeted her warmly. "Welcome back, ma'am.How was your evening? 



"It went fine," Lilly replied curtly, her tone betraying her irritation.

Clara's gaze dropped to Lilly's wist, her expression shifting to concern.“
Oh dear, what happened to your wrist?"

Before Lilly could respond, Alexander entered the room.


“I'm fine," Lilly said, pulling her hand back. She shot a glance at Alexander before adding, "Clara, you don't need to worry.”

"Let me treat it for you-" Clara began, but Lilly cut her off.


"No, it's fine." She turned on her heel and headed for the elevator,leaving Clara staring after her.

Alexander's presence loomed behind them. Clara quickly bowed.“Welcome back,sir."


He gave a terse nod before heading to the basement. There, he switched on the lights,selected a gun from the wall, and began firing at the target.Each shot rang out like a punctuation mark to his thoughts, sharp and deliberate.


Meanwhile, Lilly was pacing her room, phone in hand.

Lilly:“There's a problem."

Michael:"What happened?” Matthew:“Details,now.”" Lilly hesitated before typing: "Albert showed up. I had to tell Alexand er that we had a relationship and that I traveled to Country C." Matthew: "Does he know anything else?”

Lilly:“NNot yet.”

Matthew: "I'll deal with their investigation. I can plant a cover story to mask your time in Country C."

Lilly:“Do it. Just don't let anything about my connection,to Albert come up.”


The group chat fell silent for a moment before Sarah responded.

Sarah:“You know this can't last forever. You'll have to tell him the truth eventually.”

Lilly stared at the message, her mind a storm of conflicting thoughts.

Michael: “No, she can't reveal everything yet. Not until we've gathered enough evidence against her stepmother and stepsister."

Sarah:"He's going to find out, especially now that she's carrying his child.Do you really t'll let this go?”

The group chat erupted with stunned messages.

Michael:"Lilly... you're pregnant?!”

Matthew:“Wait,what?!” Lilly sighed, reading their shocked reactions. She quickly typed,“Let's meet tomorrow at my old place at noon," and turned off her phone. That night, Alexander didn't retuarn to their room. When she woke the next morning, her wrist was bandaged. The sight of the neatly wrapped gauze made her heart clench in confusion. She smiled faintly before shaking it off.

At breakfast, she was surprised to find Alexander still at home. He was seated at the table, casually scrolling through his tablet, his coffee untouched.

Clara greeted her warmly, serving breakfast. "Good morning, ma'am."

"Good morning, Clara," Lilly replied with a forced smile."Thank you for taking care of my wrist."

Clara blinked in confusion. “I didn't bandage your wrist,ma'am.”

Lilly froze, her gaze darting to Alexander.

Clara hesitated, glancing at him as well. “Ma'am, the truth is that Mr.Kane-”

"You're dismissed, Clara,” Alexander cut in sharply.

Clara bowed and left quickly.

Lilly turned to him, raising an eyebrow. “Did I do something wrong.Mr.Kane?” she asked, feigning innocence.

His gaze darkened, his jaw tightening. “You've made plenty of mistakes,"he said cryptically. He slid an envelope across the table toward her.

"What's this?" she asked, picking it up. “You'll accompany me to a banquet next week," he said. Lilly frowned. “You never take me to these things. Why now?" "It's the 80th birthday of the Lawrence family head. It's time I introduced you properly," he said, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Her blood ran cold. The Lawrence family was one of the most influential in Aurora City. The event would be swarming with media, ensuring her presence would not go unnoticed.


“You're planning to announce our marriage," she said,her voice barely above a whisper.


Alexander's cold smile was all the confirmation she needed.
###Chapter 26

The morning light streamed into the dining room as Lilly faced Alexander.The tension between them was palpable, the air thick with unspoken accusations. Alexander sat at the head of the table, his composure unnervingly calm as he stirred his coffee.

"Explain to me again why you're so adamant about this event," Lilly ventured, her voice steady but cautious.


Alexander didn't glance up. "It's time you played the role of Mrs. Kane in public."


Her heart thudded against her ribcage. “I thought we agreed to keep this marriage private," she countered, her tone measured.


Setting his cup down with a soft clink, Alexander fixed her with a gaze so cold it made her breath hitch. "I don't recall agreeing to anything. This marriage, like everything else, operates on my terms."

Lilly's fingers curled around her napkin, her mind racing. “Why now?What changed?”


He leaned back, a faint smirk tugging at his lips. “Perhaps I've grown tired of keeping you hidden.”


His cryptic response unsettled her. Before she could press further, he rose,buttoned his jacket, and left the room with a parting glance that promised no further discussion. As the sound of his footsteps faded, Lilly sat frozen, her thoughts a whirlwind of suspicion and fear. What was Alexander planning? Later That Day: Lilly's Apartment The air in her old apartment was thick with tension as her friends gathered around her. Matthew, Sarah, and Michael watched her expectantly.their concern evident.

“You're here early," Lilly said, forcing a faint smile to mask her unease.

Matthew crossed his arms, his expression grave. "We needed to talk. Sit down.”


The chair in the center of the roomn felt more like an interrogation spot than a place to rest. Lilly hesitated but eventually took the seat,bracing herself.


Matthew didn't waste time. "Why didn't you tell us about the pregnancy?And what's this about Kane dragging you to some high-profile event?”

Lilly exhaled, her fingers gripping the armrest. "I didn't tell you because it complicates things. As for the event..." She paused, glancing at each of them.“Alexander plans to introduce me as his wife at the Lawrence family's grand celebration."


The room erupted into chaos.

Michael's voice rose above the others."He's exposing your marriage? That wasn't part of the plan! Do you realize what this means?"

Sarah's eyes widened in alarm. "Your family will be there, won't they?They'll recognize you, Lilly. They'll know you're alive." Lilly nodded, her face resolute."That's exactly what I'm counting on." Matthew stepped closer, his tone sharp. "Have you lost your mind? If they find out, they'll come after you-and the baby." "I'm done hiding." Lilly said firmly. "This is the perfect chance to force their hand. In a public setting, with the media watching, they can't deny my existence. They'Il have to face me, and their every move will be scrutinized."


Michael shook his head. "We don't have enough evidence to take them down yet. If you make a move too soon-"

"I'll handle it," Lilly interrupted, her voice steady. “Being out in the open will force them to slip up. I need them to make mistakes, and this is how I'll do it."


Sarah stepped forward, her voice trembling. "And Alexander? What happens when he finds out the truth about who you are?"

Lilly's gaze faltered for a moment before hardening with resolve.“I'll deal with Alexander when the time comes. Right now, I need to focus on exposing my family.”

The room fell silent, the weight of her decision pressing down on all of them.

Matthew finally spoke, his voice low. "If you're set on this,we'll back you.But, Lilly... be careful. You're not just fighting for yourself anymore."

Lilly placed a hand over her stomach, a flicker of vulnerability crossing her face."I know. That's why I have to do this."

*****	******** The boardroom on the 30th floor was a hive of activity as Kate Blake made her entrance, flanked by her mother, Bella, and her assistant. The executives' murmurs quieted as she strode confidently to the front,her polished demeanor commanding the room.

"This is your moment. Kate," Bella whispered, her eyes shining with pride.

Kate nodded, her mind laser-focused on her goals. She had worked tirelessly for this position, enduring countless challenges to prove her worth. Today, she was officially taking over as CEO of Blake Real Estate Management.

"Good afternoon," Kate began, her voice smooth and poised. "I'm honored to accept the role of CEO. Together, we will continue to lead Blake Real Estate to greater heights.”


The applause that followed was deafening, but Kate's mind was elsewhere.Memories of a figure from her past-a face she thought she had seen in a crowd-gnawed at her. Could Lilly truly be alive?

Her thoughts drifted to the upcoming Lawrence family celebration. It was the perfect opportunity to solidify her standing in Aurora City's elite.And perhaps, it was time to confront the ghost of her past.

As the applause faded, Kate's resolve deepened. She would seize this moment-not just to claim her position, but to win Alexander Kane's heart.
###Chapter 27

A Few Days Later: The Banquet Gala

Lawrence Grand Hotel

The Lawrence Grand Hotel shimmered like a jewel, its opulent façade illuminated by a sea of flashbulbs. A parade of sleek, rare luxury cars glided into the entrance, each vehicle a statement of status and power.The gala was Aurora City's most exclusive event of the year, attracting the crème de la crème of society. Celebrities, moguls, and aristocrats graced the crimson carpet, their polished images immortalized by relentless photographers.

"Who will steal the show this year?” a reporter whispered, her eyes scanning the sea of arrivals.

Suddenly, gasps rippled through the crowd as a glossy black limousine slid to a halt. The air buzzed with anticipation, cameras poised for the grand reveal. As the door opened, Kate Blake stepped out,her gown glittering like starlight under the flashes. She carried herself with the poise of someone born to dominate a room, her every step calculated to perfection.

“Ms. Blake, over here! Tell us about your recent promotion!” a reporter called out, his microphone thrust forward. Kate turned, her polished smile masking the flutter of nerves beneath.“It's an incredible honor to lead Blake Real Estate Management. Tonight,though, I'm just here to enjoy the celebration.” As the media devoured her every word, Kate's gaze flitted toward the hotel entrance, Her heart raced, though not from the attention lavished upon her. She wasn't here to bask in the spotlight. Tonight, her eyes were set on one man-Alexander Kane.

“Still dreaming about him?" Amanda, a close friend, teased as Kate joined their group inside the grand hall.

Kate's smile tightened. "Dreaming? No. Tonight, he'll finally notice me."

Before Amanda could retort, a hush fell over the crowd outside. Every head turned as the unmistakable growl of a custom Mercedes-Benz Maybach Exelero sliced through the murmurs. The car's arrival was a statement: only one man in Aurora City commanded such presence.


“Alexander Kane," someone breathed, the name rolling like thunder through the crowd.


The car door opened, and his aide, James, stepped out first, scanning the scene with precision. Then came Alexander himself, stepping into the limelight with effortless command. Dressed in a tailored midnight-black suit, his sharp features exuded power. The mere sight of him was enough to silence the chaos, every camera trained on his every move.

But it wasn't just Alexander who stole the night. He turned back toward the car, extending his hand. A collective gasp echoed as a woman emerged, her presence radiant and arresting. Lilly Kane stepped into view, her gown an ethereal masterpiece that clung to her figure with elegant precision. The intricately beaded bodice shimmered under the soft glow, and her poise rivaled even the most seasoned socialites. The crowd froze. "Who is she?" whispers spread like wildfire. "She's breathtaking.. but I've never seen her before."

Reporters clamored to break the silence. "Mr. Kane, is she your date?"

Alexander's lips curved into a faint smile, his voice a smooth enigma.“You'll know soon enough.”

With Lily's hand in his, he strode toward the entrance, their presence leaving an indelible mark.

Inside, the gala hall buzzed with anticipation. Conversations stilled as eyes turned to the grand doors. Kate's breath caught in her throat as the announcer stepped forward, his expression betraying a flicker of disbelief.

“Presenting... Mr. Alexander Kane and Mrs. Lilly Kane."

The declaration hit the room like a lightning strike. The name reverberated through the hall,leaving an eerie silence in its wake.

Kate's glass slipped from her fingers, shattering against the marble floor.Her world tilted as the name echoed in her ears: Mrs. Lilly Kane.

"No,” Kate whispered, her voice trembling with disbelief. Her eyes locked on the woman by Alexander's side, her composure crumbling.

Bella's lips pressed into a thin line, her grip tightening around her champagne flute. "It can't be," she muttered under her breath. “She's supposed to be dead."

All eyes were on Lilly as she glided into the room, Alexander's arm wrapped around her possessively. Her heart pounded, but her expression remained serene, the perfect mask of confidence.

Kate's mind raced. Lilly? Alive? Married to Alexander? How?
Alexander, sensing the stir he'd created, leaned toward Lilly.“Enjoying the attention?"


Lilly's voice was steady, though her pulse thundered in her ears. “I think you enjoy it more."


He smirked, his gaze sweeping the room like a predator assessing its prey."Let them wonder. It's more entertaining that way."

Kate couldn't tear her eyes away. Every dream, every plan she had crafted for this night unraveled before her. Lilly's return wasn't just a disruption-it was a reckoning.

As the couple made their way further into the room, the whispers grew louder. The Blake family's faces were masks of barely concealed shock and anger. Kate clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms.

“This isn't over," she vowed under her breath, her eyes burning with unbridled determination.

Alexander's voice broke through Lilly's thoughts as they approached the center of the room. "Ready to meet the lions?"

Lilly lifted her chin, her resolve hardening. “I've been ready my whole life.



The tension was palpable, the air electric with unanswered questions. Lilly could feel the weight of every gaze on her, but she refused to falter. As Alexander led her into the heart of the lion's den, a storm brewed-one that would shatter the fragile facades of power,secrets, and deceit. Bella's eyes darted around the room. Too many were already watching.With a forced smile, she tugged Kate into a secluded corner, her voice a low but firm warning.
###Chapter 28

The air in the grand banquet hall was thick with tension. Kate stood frozen,her heart pounding in her chest as her mother's hand gripped her arm tightly.


"Oh no, Kate, you'll ruin your dress!" Amanda exclaimed, her voice tinged with alarm as she dabbed at the spilled wine on Kate's gown. But Kate didn't move-her focus was singular, her gaze locked on Lilly and Alexander.


Bella's face was a storm of emotions, her usually composed demeanor faltering. Her trembling hand clutched her own glass, and she struggled to steady herself. She cast a glance at her husband, Peter, whose expression was a strange mix of astonishment and... joy.

Is he pleased? Bella thought, the question sending a surge of cold anger through her. She shifted her attention back to Kate, whose fiery determination was written all over her face as she started toward Lilly.

“Let me go, Mother!" Kate hissed, yanking at Bella's grip.

"What are you planning to do, Kate?" Bella whispered urgently,trying to mask their argument from the prying eyes around them.

“Didn't you hear the announcer?” Kate snapped, her voice barely a whisper but sharp with fury. "Mrs. Kane. She's back to steal everything-Alexander, the company, my future. I won't stand here and let her take it all.” "Listen to me. Kate." Bella said, her tone laced with steel. "You cannot make a scene here. Compose yourself, or you'll ruin more than your dress."

"How can I stay calm with her flaunting hersef as Mrs. Kane?" Kate spat.

Bella's lips pressed into a thin line. “I'll deal with her. Focus on maintaining your image, Kate. This battle requires strategy, not emotion."

Kate's glare softened just enough to show she was listening, though her fists remained clenched at her sides.


Across the hall, Peter stood rooted in place, his eyes locked on Lilly. He could barely believe it-his daughter, presumed lost for years, was alive and standing mere feet away. A thousand questions churned in his mind.Where has she been? Why didn't anyone find her? And why is she now...Mrs.Kane?


"Should we inform the old master?" his assistant murmured beside him.

Peter shook his head, his voice quiet but firm. "No need. He knows."

His gaze met Lilly's, but her expression was unreadable, her icy stare enough to halt his tentative steps forward. Does she still blame me? For her sisters? He stayed back, his heart aching with the distance between them.

Lilly felt the weight of every stare as she stood beside Alexander.She had noticed Kate's attempted approach and Bella's swift intervention. Good,she thought. Not tonight, Kate. “Lilly, you look stunning," Sophia's familiar voice broke through her thoughts, accompanied by a warm kiss on her cheek. "She does," Richard added, his easy grin adding a rare moment of levity. "Thank you," Lilly replied, her tone gracious but guarded.

“You're stealing the spotlight, as usual," Richard teased. “Though I admit,
I never thought I'd see Alexander Kane introducing anyone as his wife.
You'll have to work hard to convince everyone it's real."

Alexander remained silent, his stoic demeanor unshaken as he motioned for Lilly to follow him.


They crossed the hall to another cluster of influential guests, where
Alexander's long-time friend Ethan greeted him with a warm smile.

"I've missed you, my friend," Ethan said, clapping Alexander on the shoulder.


"I'm busy," Alexander replied coolly, brushing past him.

Ethan's attention shifted to Lilly. "And who's this vision of beauty?"

"She was announced as Mrs. Kane," Alexander said, his tone sharp.

Ethan froze, his jaw slack with shock. "Is this some sort of joke?"

Alexander leaned in, his voice low and cutting."It's not. And you'd best remember that."

Ethan's stunned expression followed them as they moved on.

As they approached the patriarch of the Lawrence family, the tension in the air grew heavier. The old master's frown deepened at the sight of Lilly,and his voice was laced with irritation.

“You troublemaker," he said, glaring at Alexander. “Of all the headaches you've caused me, this one takes the crown." Alexander's response was calm but unyielding. "This is my wife, Lilly Evans."

Lilly bowed politely, her movements measured andI graceful despite the scrutiny.


The old master's eyes narrowed as he addressed her."You should consider yourself lucky to be with him. Without him, you'd be nothing."

Lilly held her composure, though she bristled internally.


Alexander's response was a quiet but firm declaration. “It's my choice."

The old master's frustration was evident, but he waved them toward the table. "Sit. Enjoy the meal. We'll discuss this later."

As the third course was served, Lilly's stomach churned. She excused herself and hurried to the restroom, her composure finally cracking as she retched into the sink. Steadying herself, she splashed water on her face before stepping back into the corridor.

Two towering men in black blocked her path.


“Miss Lilly Evans," one said, his tone devoid of warmth. “You need to come with us.”.


Her eyes darted around-Alexander's guards were nowhere to be seen.Panic prickled at the edges of her calm. “Who sent you?”

“You'll find out soon enough," the other replied, stepping closer. Before she could scream, a cloth was pressed to her mouth.Darkness closed in as she realized, too late, that the trap had been sprung.

###Chapter 29

Kate's gaze was like a hawk, fixed on Lilly and Alexander throughout the event. Fury simmered beneath her poised exterior, her clenched fists betraying her true feelings.

“You shouldn't worry so much," Amanda murmured, her tone laced with mischief as she swirled the wine in her glass. "I've heard rumors that their so-called marriage might not even be real.”

Kate turned sharply to her. "What did you hear?"

Amanda smirked. “Oh, just whispers. People are saying no one truly believes Alexander would tie himself down. They think he's using her to dodge Old Master Lowe's plans to marry him off to his granddaughter. So.darling, the door isn't shut for you just yet.”

Kate's lips curled into a slow smile. "That explains a lot." She turned her eyes back to Lilly, who had just left the hall for the restroom.Her father,Peter,stood nearby, his gaze lingering on Lilly like a shadow.

How pathetic, Kate thought. He knows she'll never forgive him, and yet he still watches her like a ghost from the past. I'm the only daughter he has now. Lilly disowned him the moment she walked away.

"Now that Lilly's gone, isn't this the perfect moment to approach Alexander?" Bella's voice broke through Kate's thoughts as she joined them. Kate's smile grew sharper. "Why didn't I think of that?" She pulled out a compact mirror, ensuring her makeup was flawless and her smile inviting. “You look stunning, darling. Go on," Bella urged, her eyes glinting with encouragement.

Kate nodded and moved gracefully toward Alexander, her heels clicking softly on the polished floor. Her heart raced with anticipation. This was her chance to make her mark.


"What's Kate up to?" Peter asked, noticing his daughter's determined stride toward Alexander.


Bella,standing beside him, raised a brow. “Relax, Peter. She's networking.Kate's the new CEO of Blake Real Estate. She's merely seeking a business collaboration. Who better to align with than Alexander Kane?”

Peter sighed, though his eyes remained on Kate. "I hope she doesn't stir trouble with Lilly.”

Bella smiled thinly. "You underestimate her, Peter.She knows what she's doing.”

Kate rehearsed her lines in her head as she neared Alexander, who was deep in conversation with Ethan. Her pulse quickened, but she forced herself to stay composed. With a measured breath, she spoke.

“Hello,Mr.Kane.”

Alexander turned his piercing gaze on her for a fleeting moment before returning his attention to Ethan without a word.

Kate felt heat rise to her cheeks, a mixture of humiliation and frustration threatening to crack her poise. She had idolized Alexander since high school,but now his cold dismissal stung deeper than she anticipated.Swallowing her pride, she tried again.

"I'm Kate, the new CEO of Blake Real Estate. I'd like to discuss a
potential collaboration with you."

Ethan paused, his curiosity piqued and looked at her. Alexander, however,remained indifferent, his attention now shifting to his watch.

"Twenty minutes," Alexander muttered, his brow furrowing. He signaled one of his guards. "Find out where she is."

"Yes,boss," the guard replied, immediately heading toward the restroom.

Kate froze. He's talking about Lilly.

Her frustration deepened as she watched the man she admired dismiss her entirely for the sake of her.

Determined not to slink away in defeat, Kate boldly slid into the empty chair Lilly had left behind. That finally drew Alexander's attention.

“Get up and leave," he said, his voice like ice.

The chill in his words sent shivers down Kate's spine, but she forced herself to stand with a small, embarrassed smile. Just as she was about to retreat, the guards returned, their faces pale with fear as they whispered urgently to Alexander. His expression darkened instantly, and he shot up from his seat.

"What's going on?” Ethan asked,already following his friend. Curiosity burned in Kate's chest, and she trailed behind them. By now,the unusual movement had caught the attention of others, including Old Master Lowe, who motioned for his men to investigate the growing commotion. Peter's eyes narrowed as he noticed the sudden stir. When he saw Alexander and Kate heading toward the restroom, alarm bells rang in his mind.

"Where are you going, Peter?" Bella asked, trying to mnask her unease as she saw the same thing.

"Lilly hasn't returned. It's been too long, and now Alexander is heading in her direction. Something's wrong." Peter made to leave, but Bella grabbed his arm.

“Don't. You've stayed calm this entire night, and now you want to create a scene? Let her come back on her own.”

Peter shook her off. "I need to know."


With a sigh of exasperation, Bella followed him, though her nails dug into her palms in barely contained frustration.

"What do you mean she's gone?” Alexander's voice was like a thunderclap.and the trembling guards flinched under his fury.

"We were ambushed," one of them stammered, blood trickling from his temple."Two men. They knocked us out and took her."

"Who dares take my wife?" Alexander's voice dropped to a lethal growl as he grabbed one guard by the collar. "If she isn't found, you're all dead.”

Ethan quickly intervened. “Calm down, Alexander. I've already sent my men to search the hotel and review the CCTV footage.We'll find her." “It's not enough," Alexander snapped, his jaw tightening as he stormed toward the exit. "If someone has taken her, they'll regret it." Peter arrived just intime to hear Alexander's threats. His face turned ashen as he pushed through the gathering crowd.


"Where is my daughter?" Peter demanded, his voice ringing out like a cannon blast.

Alexander stopped in his tracks, his sharp eyes locking on Peter.

“What daughter?” Ethan asked,confused.

Peter's voice shook with both anger and desperation. "Lilly. She came with you, and now she's missing. If anything happens to her, her grandfather will come for you.”


Ethan's expression shifted to shock as he turned to Alexander.“Your wife is a Blake?"


Kate's heart plummeted as the revelation hit her like a sledgehammer.Her fists clenched at her sides.


Alexander's face was unreadable, but the tension in his frame betrayed his inner turmoil. His thoughts were a storm of questions. Lilly. A Blake. Why didn't she tell me?

His expression hardened. One thing was clear, when he found her, Lilly would have a lot to explain.
###Chapter 30

Lilly's eyes fluttered open, her senses groggy and disoriented. The first thing she noticed was the soft silk of the sheets beneath her and the faint scent of lavender in the air. She pressed her hand instinctively to her abdomen, her breath hitching until relief swept over her, there was no pain.Her baby was safe.

As her mind cleared, she sat up and took in her surroundings. The room was spacious, the decor blending timeless elegance with subtle modern touches. But what caught her attention most were the portraits hanging on the wall, hers. One showed her as a carefree teenager, and the other, more recent, captured her with an air of quiet defiance.

A chill ran down her spine as recognition struck. This wasn't just any room; it was her room from years ago. Though updated with a larger bed and an adult aesthetic, the space remained unmistakably hers. She hadn't set foot here in over a decade, not since she and her sisters had fled the Blake mansion after their mother's death.


Memories flooded her, some warm, most bitter. She had lived here under the protective shadow of her grandfather, shielded from the betrayals that had torn their family apart. But even his watchful eye hadn't been enough to erase the scars Bella, her father, and Kate had inflicted. Her mother had been pregnant with her when her father's affair with Bella came to light, Bella, bold and unapologetic, had moved in, claiming her place as a second wife with her infant daughter, Kate. The scandal had shattered their family, leaving her mother a ghost of the vibrant woman she once was. She died when Lilly was five, the circumstances shrouded in secrecy, a mystery Lilly had vowed to unravel. Her hand brushed against the vanity table as she walked around the room.the sound startling her. She couldn't suppress a bitter laugh. She had known returning to the public eye would catch her grandfather's attention,but she hadn't expected him to kidnap her from the banquet.

Still, it was a twisted relief. For a fleeting moment, she had feared it was Bella, or worse, Kate, attempting to harm her and her unborn child. Yet here she was, safe under her grandfather's roof.

Her thoughts darkened, she knew he would be waiting, likely in his study.He would demand answers for her two-year absence and the secrets she had kept. But she had made peace with the confrontation, she had returned stronger, with plans in motion to bring the culprits to justice.

Lilly approached the door, squaring her shoulders. When she opened it,two of her grandfather's guards stood at attention, their imposing figures blocking the hallway.

"Where is my grandfather?" she asked, her tone calm yet firm.

One of them stepped forward. "This way, ma'am.”

They led her down the long corridors she hadn't walked in years,their familiarity both comforting and suffocating. Each step echoed with memories, laughter with her sisters, the coldness of betrayal, and the weight of her mother's absence.

Finally, they reached the study. She paused at the door, her pulse quickening. After a deep breath, she knocked. “Enter," came the deep, authoritative voice that could silence an entire room. She pushed the door open and stepped inside, closing it softly behind her. The air was thick with tension, the room dimly lit except for the warm glow of the lamp on her grandfather's desk.

Caleb Blake sat behind it, his form as imposing as she remembered.Despite his age, his presence commanded respect and fear in equal measure. He was hunched over, writing with an ink pen on a scroll, a tradition he refused to abandon even in the digital age.

Lilly walked to the center of the room and lowered herseIf onto a mat,bowing until her forehead touched the floor in a gesture of deep respect.She remained in that position, waiting for him to acknowledge her.

Minutes stretched into what felt like an eternity before the scratching of the pen stopped.

Caleb raised his head, his sharp eyes boring into her. The worry etched into his features betrayed the anger in his voice. "So, the wayward granddaughter returns."

Lilly lifted her head, her voice trembling.“Grandfather.”

The crack of his palm hitting the desk made her flinch.

"You dare call me that?" His voice thundered through the room.“You selfish child! What kind of granddaughter disappears for two years without a word? You didn't even attend your sisters' funerals!"

Tears stung her eyes as the weight of his words settled over her. He stood, his towering figure casting a shadow over her. "Do you have any idea what you've put me through? And to hear just now that you married,without my knowledge or consent? You've disgraced this family!" Lilly's voice broke as she replied, "Do you think I wanted to disappear? After my sisters died, if I had stayed, you would have lost me too. I had no choice; I had to hide, gather evidence, and bring their killers to justice."

Caleb's glare softened, a flicker of doubt clouding his anger. He sat back down heavily, his face grave. “You speak as if you know who killed them."

"I do," she whispered, her tears falling freely now. "But without proof, I couldn't risk exposing myself. I would have been their next target."

The room fell silent, and Caleb lost in thought. He had spent every resource at his disposal hunting for the culprits and his missing granddaughter. Their ability to evade him spoke to the power of their enemies.


"You could have been protected," he finally said, his voice quieter but no less firm. "After your sisters' deaths, I ensured the strongest security. And yet you still vanished."

Lilly bit her lip, knowing he didn't suspect Bella or Kate. Their guilt was a truth she carried alone, one she couldn't reveal until the evidence was undeniable. But now that they knew she was alive, they would make a move,and she would be ready.

“Grandfather, I'm sorry," she said, bowing deeply again. “Forgive me for the pain I've caused you."

Caleb studied her for a long moment before exhaling sharply. “Since you've apologized, I'll lessen your punishment." Her stomach dropped. She remembered his punishments all too well,creative, thorough, and unforgettable. "And also," he added, his gaze hardening, "you will divorce him." Lilly's head snapped up. her heart racing."Wha?"

"You heard me." he said coldly. "You will divorce Alexander Kane."

The weight of his command hung heavy in the air, and for the first time in years. Lilly felt truly trapped.
###Chapter 31

The grand banquet hall, once filled with high society chatter,fell abruptly silent. Alexander, his face a mask of authority and barely contained fury,had commanded the event to a swift and unceremonious end. With a sharp gesture, he ordered the guests to leave, and one by one, they filtered out, leaving behind only whispers and speculation. Journalists, unable to resist the pull of the unknown, lingered in the shadows, eager to uncover the reason behind the premature closure. They could feel the storm brewing but knew better than to approach.

Elsewhere, Old Master Lowe, a confidant of Caleb Blake, received the shocking news of Lilly's disappearance-along with the devastating truth of her identity. A woman he had initially thought was merely Alexander's wife had turned out to be the long-lost heiress to the Blake empire. The revelation hit like a bolt, the implications running far deeper than he could have imagined. Caleb had spent two years searching for her, and now.to learn she had been taken once again, this time with the knowledge of her true lineage, was enough to rattle even Lowe's steely resolve.

He wasted no time. The event, now a forgotten memory, had to end, and Alexander's search needed to begin in earnest. Caleb would be enraged, his fury amplified by the knowledge that his granddaughter had vanished-again-just as she had resurfaced. He had no time to waste, and neither did Alexander. The clock was ticking. Hours later, past midnight, Bella and Kate stood side by side in the cold,empty parking lot. Their search for Lilly had yielded nothing, and the frustration gnawed at them. Three hours had passed since the conclusion of the banquet, and still, there was no sign of Lilly. Kate's thoughts churned, her fists clenched as she stared at the ground, frustration turning into quiet fury. "Mother, was this your doing?"Kate's voice was a low, tense whisper,laden with suspicion as she glanced at Bela, who had always been a schemer atheart.


Bella's lips curled into a thin smile, but there was no humor in it. "No, I wouldn't be so foolish as to kidnap her in a place where we could be easily identified. Alexander will find her. He's powerful, and I'm sure she's safe...for now."

Kate narrowed her eyes, though she hated to admit it, her mother's logic was sound. But that didn't stop the gnawing resentment."Today has been the worst day of my life," Kate muttered through gritted teeth, anger building. Initially, she had hoped Bella had orchestrated the abduction,but now she saw it was unlikely. And then there was Alexander. His frantic search, as if Lilly were the most precious thing in the world to him, only made Kate's stomach turn. Why does he care so much? she wondered, her mind swirling with unanswered questions.

Kate balled her fists, pacing, trying to quell the rising tide of jealousy.She couldn't just let Lilly waltz back into their lives, reclaim her birthright, and win over the man Kate had set her sights on. No. She couldn't.

“Your father's coming," Bella remarked, her voice cutting through Kate's spiraling thoughts.

Kate froze. She didn't need to look to know what was coming.

Peter's silhouette emerged from the shadows, his stride confident and purposeful. "Have they found her?" he asked, his voice clipped with urgency. "I've just received word," Bella answered, her eyes narrowing. "Two of my men have been following Alexander's team. He's heading to the Blake estate."


A flicker of alarm passed between mother and daughter. "Why would he go there?" Kate asked her voice tight with confusion.

"He found out she was taken there," Peter replied, his words sending a jolt through the air.


Lilly... at the Blake estate? The realization hit like a blow to the chest. The mansion, the home where the Blake legacy was built.Why would Alexander think she was there?

Peter's expression softened. "It's Caleb. He took her."

“Grandfather took her?” Bella's voice was a mix of disbelief and shock.She had never expected him to act so swiftly, so decisively.

Kate stood frozen in place, her mind racing, piecing thefragments of this twisted puzzle together. Caleb... The very thought of him stirred a deep.uncomfortable fear inside her.

"I'm relieved it was him," Peter added, his tone cold and final. "Let's head back.”

Bella's composure returned as she nodded sharply, giving Kate one last glance before heading towards the car. "Let's go." Reluctantly, Kate followed. Her heart thudded in her chest as they climbed into the car. A sense of dread hung over her like a dark cloud, and she couldn't shake the feeling that things were about to take a darker turn. Back at the Blake Estate... The tension inside the Blake estate was palpable as Alexander sat in the car, his fingers tapping relentlessly against the armrest. His men, eight cars deep, stood by, ready to back him up if the gates didn't open on their own.Every moment that passed felt like an eternity, the silence between them filled with the promise of a coming storm. If the estate guards didn't let him in,he would break through.

James, sitting beside him, couldn't ignore the look of determination etched across Alexander's face. This wasn't just a man searching for his wife.This was something else, something deeper. Alexander wasn't just seeking Lilly-he was preparing for a confrontation, one that would shatter everything in its path.

"Since we know her grandfather has her, and she's safe, why don't we just leave? He'll send her back, or she'll come back on her own." James suggested, trying to reason with him.

But Alexander'ssmirk was cold, unexpected, sending a shiver through James. It was a rare expression from the usually composed man.

"No, he won't," Alexander said quietly, the words heavy with meaning."As far as he knows, she's still married to me. He won't let her return to me willingly."

James blinked, trying to process the deeper implication of Alexander's words. What did he mean by that? He didn't have time to dwell on the thought. The gate had swung open, and the convoy moved forward,driving into the estate. Inside the mansion, the tension was thick as Alexander stepped from the car,his demeanor regal and commanding. Guards didn't dare challenge him as he moved forward, a man on a mission. Inside the estate. Paul, a middle-aged servant, led Alexander down winding corridors before stopping at a broad, imposing door. With a knock,Paul received permission to enter.

Lilly was there. Sitting on the plush mat in the middle of the study.looking smaller than usual in the vast room. Her eyes locked with his the moment he stepped inside, and Alexander's heart twisted at the sight of her, vulnerable, yet strangely composed.

"Mr. Kane, Master Caleb is waiting." Paul announced.

Lilly stood in haste, her eyes flickering between Alexander and Caleb,who remained seated, a commanding presence in the room. But before Lilly could say a word, Alexander strode toward her, ignoring the stillness that enveloped the room. His voice was low, firm. “Let's go.”

Lilly's heart raced. She glanced at her grandfather and then back at Alexander.

Her grandfather's voice cut through the thick air likea knife."I only permitted this visit to inform you-she will not leave with you. She will be filing for a separation."

"Separation?" Alexander's eyes flashed, narrowing as he looked at Lilly,his gaze demanding answers.

Lilly's lips parted, but Alexander silenced her with a sharp motion. “Save it for later," he muttered."You have a lot to explain." The words hung in the air,heavy with tension. "I advise you to leave now," Caleb warned,his eyes cold. But Alexander wasn't moving. He stood his ground, his eyes locked onto Caleb's. "You know I will leave with her. Whether you like it or not."

Their eyes met, the room growing colder as the silent battle raged between them. Lilly stood frozen, her heart pounding, her mind a swirl of confusion. What had her grandfather just warned her about? What did she not know about Alexander that was now coming to light?

Caleb's next words cut through the air like a blade. "You have no idea what kind of man you married. What you think you know about him...is far from the whole truth.”

Lilly's breath caught in her throat. What was her grandfather trying to tell her?

Alexander's unreadable expression deepened. The silence in the room was deafening. One thing was clear, this wasn't just about Lilly anymore. The secrets, the lies, they were about to come to light, and nothing would ever be the same again.

The night stretched on, longer and darker than either of them could have imagined. The truth was about to unravel.
###Chapter 32

Lilly's mind raced as she tried to piece together the cryptic words her grandfather had left her with. What kind of man had she married? The question echoed in her mind like a relentless drumbeat. Caleb had been so sure-so certain-that there was something she didn't understand.something hidden beneath Alexander's cold exterior. The way the two men had locked eyes before she left the room, their silent tension unmistakable, made it clear that their relationship was more than it appeared.


"Lilly,you need to make a smart choice and stay." Caleb's voice had been low, but it carried a weight that unsettled her. His words still hung in the air as she glanced back at Alexander, who was waiting for her to make her move.

Her eyes flicked between her grandfather and her husband. She wanted to say something, to make sense of this chaos, but the tension in the room had become unbearable. After a long moment, Lilly spoke, her voice tentative. "Can I stay tonight and return tomorrow?"

"No," Alexander's response was immediate, his grip on her hand firmn as he gntly, but decisvely, led her toward the door. Lilly stole one last glance at her grandfather,and the expression on his face-disappointment mingled with a simmering fury-made her chest tighten. There was more going on here than she had realized, and as she stepped outside the mansion, she knew she was walking into something far darker than she had anticipated. Outside, James sat in the car, lounging as if he had all the time in the world. The guards stood at attention, guns at the ready,waiting for a signal from their boss to act. Lilly barely noticed them,her mind too clouded by the events inside.

The sound of another car pulling up broke through her fog. Peter, Bella,and Kate stepped out, their surprise evident as they took in thescene before them.


"What is happening here?" Peter asked, his voice low but sharp as he approached James.


"Alexander is here to retrieve his wife," James answered nonchalantly,watching the scene unfold.

Peter's gaze shifted to the armed guards, his confusion palpable. "I understand that, but why all the commotion?"

"They're just doing their duty to protect their boss," James replied, his tone dismissive, as though this were a matter of little consequence.


Before Peter could respond, Lilly emerged from the mansion, her hand still held tightly in Alexander's. Kate's eyes flared with jealousy as she watched the two of them walk toward the car, their connection unmistakable.


"Lilly!" Peter called out.

Lilly slowed her pace, prompting Alexander to stop as well, his grip on her hand tightening imperceptibly.


"Get in the car," he commanded, his voice as cold as steel. "Just a minute," she replied, her words quiet but firm. She broke free from his grasp and walked toward her family. Lilly's eyes swept over her mother and sister before landing onPeter."I just want you to know that I'm back, and you know what that means,right?" Her words were laced with an edge,and she let the unspoken threat hang in the air.

Bella's eyebrows arched, a silent undlerstanding passing between them.Kate's expression twisted into something darker, and Peter shifted uncomfortably, but Lilly paid them no mind.

"I'm glad you're back, Lilly; we were worried," Bella said, her voice dripping with a sweetness that didn't quite reach her eyes.

Lilly's smile was chilling, almost wicked. "If you were worried before, you should be even more worried now." With that, she turned, walking back to the car with Alexander.

As the two of them climbed into the car, Alexander cast one last glance at the three of them, his gaze unreadable. He didn't speak, only gestured for the driver to take them away.

James,always observant, climbed into their vehicle, the convoy following them silently into the night.

Peter stood watching, his fists clenched in quiet frustration as the cars pulled away from the mansion. He knew something was wrong,something had shifted, but he couldn't yet put his finger on it.

Kate's patience had long since run out. With a growl of frustration,she stormed back into the house, Bella trailing behind her like a shadow. The moment they were inside, Kate didn't hesitate. She stormed over to her dressing table, throwing things onto the floor in a fit of rage. "I'm so furious right now, Mother!" she spat, her voice trembling with anger."If Alexander hadn't been there, I would have slapped her! I can't believe she dared to threaten us like that! Does she think she can just waltz back into our lives?"

Bella's face remained impassive as she stepped forward, gently placing a hand on Kate's shoulder to calm her. "Shush, lower your voice," she murmured, her tone surprisingly soft.

Kate fought to control her breathing, but the frustration refused to dissipate. "I hate her, Mother. I hate that she's back. She's challenging me on every front. I can't believe she married Alexander! She must have known I liked him and is just trying to get under my skin!”

Bella's eyes narrowed, a slow smile curling on her lips as she settled onto the couch. "Relax," she said, her voice cool and calculating.“Alexander doesn't like women, so how did he end up marrying Lilly?"

Kate paused, her fury momentarily faltering. “That's true. How did he marry her?”

Bella's smile deepened as she began to piece things together in her mind.“And how did they meet? Alexander was shocked that she was she's a Blake. That means their meeting-and marriage-must have happened under different circumstances."

Kate's mind raced, trying to connect the dots. "Exactly. What I need to know now is how they met.., and why he married her.Something's not right about this." Bella stood, walking over to Kate with an air of quiet authority.She took her daughter's hand, squeezing it gently. “Don't worry about it. I'l find out everything she's been up to for the past two years. All you need to do is focus on your role as CEO and act normal around her.” Kate scowled."That will be hard, Mother. I despise her."

Bella's smile was soft but dangerous. "I'll handle her. Leave her to me.I promise she'll be out of our lives soon enough."

Kate smiled back, her anger simmering beneath the surface.“Okay, Mother.”

The drive back to Alexander's mansion was suffocatingly silent. Lilly had tried to speak, to explain herself, but Alexander's cold demeanor cut her off at every turn. His words were sharp, accusing. “You're a liar and a deceiver," he spat, his grip on the steering wheel tightening with anger.“And after yougive birth to my child, I'll divorce you."

Lilly swallowed hard, the sting of his words cutting deeper than she had expected. HHer phone buzzed with messages from Michael, Matthew,and Sarah,but she ignored them for now. They deserved an explanation,but she knew she couldn't offer one until she confronted Alexander. And that,she knew, was not going to be easy.

She glanced at him, watching as his fingers flew over his phone screen,his expression locked in icy silence. What had she missed? What did she not know about Alexander? What was it that had made Caleb so sure she had no idea who she had married? When they finally arrived at the mansion, it was already 2 a.m. Lilly was exhausted, every muscle in her body aching from the emotional strain of the night. But she knew she wouldn't sleep until she had explained herself to Alexander until she had convinced him she wasn't the person he believed her to be. As soon as the car stopped, Alexander stepped out, moving toward the house with purposeful strides. Lilly followed, trying to gather her thoughts.

Inside, Clara greeted them with her usual warm smile. "Welcome back, sir,"she said, but her eyes flicked nervously between Alexander and Lilly.

"Welcome back, ma'am," Clara said softly, offering Lilly a polite smile.

Lilly managed a tight smile before moving past Clara and stepping into the elevator. Alexander was already inside, his posture rigid and unyielding. Lilly reached for the door just as it was about to close,stepping inside before it could.

The elevator doors slid shut with a soft chime, and the tension between them was suffocating. Lilly dared not speak, not with the murderous expression on Alexander's face. She waited. She had no choice but to wait until they were in the privacy of their room.

The moment the door closed behind them, Lilly opened her mouth to speak,but Alexander was faster.

“You're a liar and a deceiver," he growled, advancing toward her,his eyes dark with anger."If you knew I was taking you to the banquet, why didn't you tell me? Why did you hide from your family?"

Lilly's heart thudded painfully in her chest. She had no idea where to begin, but she owed him the truth. "I should have told you before the banquet," she whispered, her voice shaking. "But I was afraid... so afraid.Two years ago, my sisters and I were targeted, and they were murdered.I was the next target, so I had to hide my identity to protect myself.Then you came into my life, and I thought... I thought it was the wrong time to tell you the truth." Alexander's face remained impassive as he processed her words,but his next question struck her like a blow. "Why did you marry me? Was it for money?” Lilly's throat tightened. How could she explain it to him? How could she tell him that she married him because she loved him

? But the truth was, she was scared of losing him. The words stuck in her throat.

Before she could speak, Alexander reached out, grabbing her wrist with a strength that made her wince. "Tell me the truth. No more lies,"he said darkly, his grip tightening. "If you lie again... you'll regret it."

Lilly's heart raced. She could feel the truth welling up inside her,but was she ready to say it? Could she tell him that all this time, she had only wanted to be with him?

The silence stretched between them, heavy with expectation. And then, in that moment,something shifted.

Would she finally tell him the truth?
###Chapter 33

When Alexander had instructed James to look into Lilly around the time they married, he never anticipated the uncertainty that would linger.The investigation revealed nothing beyond what Lilly had already disclosed, a mysterious gift for his grandmother, a costly gem with no traceable payment, and a gap in the information that James couldn't fill. But there was something about Lilly, something elusive and unspoken, that gnawed at him. What was her true motive for marrying him? If she dared lie again,he was determined to unearth a side of himself she had never seen.

Lilly stood before him, her heart racing as she fought to find the right words. He had been cold, calculating, even when she had hoped for something more. She had no choice but to be honest now. The weight of truth was unbearable, but perhaps it was the only way forward.

"I..."

"YOU WHAT?!" Alexander's voice was low but sharp, the impatience clear.

Lilly's gaze fell to their feet, her voice faltering. But before she could look away for comfort, Alexander gripped her chin,forcing her to meet his gaze.

"Look me in the eye while you talk so I can tell if you're lying," he commanded,his voice chilling.

"Go on," he pressed, his stare unwavering. Lilly's throat tightened, but she took a deep breath, gathering all her courage."I didn't marry you for money, but because I wanted to. The other women who were at the banquet that day had two reasons: your wealth and the title of Mrs. Kane. I had only one-I love you.” Her words hung in the air, their weight sinking in between them.She searched his face, hoping to seea flicker of emotion. But his expression remained unreadable, impossible to decipher.

"I love you, Alexander. I don't want our marriage to end after ayear and six months; I want it to last," she added, her voice trembling. Yet, despite the intensity of her plea, Alexander's face was as cold as ice, not a flicker of warmth or recognition.

Minutes passed like hours. Lilly waited, each second stretching the silence thinner and thinner. Finally, Alexander spoke, his voice an emotionless command.

“Tomorrow,your belongings will be moved back to your previous room.We will not interfere in each other's lives as stipulated in the contract.Understood?”

Lilly's stomach turned. The words were a dagger to her heart. She wanted to argue, to plead, butthe nausea that had been building in her chest suddenly overwhelmed her. Without a word, she rushed to the bathroom.her body trembling.

From the bathroom, she heard him-still standing in the hallway, his presence unwavering. But she couldn't bring herself to look at him. She retched, her stomach emptying its contents into the toilet,as her thoughts spun, What had she done wrong? Was this how it would end? Was their marriage nothing more than a cold agreement after all? When she was done, she cleaned herself up, feeling the weight of his words press down on her chest. She sat on the toilet, reluctant to face him.her mind reeling with confusion and fear. She only moved when she heard the distinct sound of the door closing-Alexander had left. She stood slowly, her heart still pounding. His words echoed in her mind like an unrelenting storm. Tomorrow. Move back to your room. Cold.Detached. There was no warmth left in his eyes, no connection. Had she failed him so utterly?

The next day, Alexander wasted no time. As soon as she woke,the move was underway, her things were being moved back to the second-floor room where she had first been placed. The separation was cold,final.There would be no further closeness, no reconciliation. Not yet.

Meanwhile, far from the mansion, Richard and Sophia were reeling from James's call. The information he had shared was staggering.

"This is huge," Sophia murmured, her voice thick with disbelief.


"I always knew there was something about her. She never fit the mold.She looked like she belonged to an elite world, but this... This is far bigger than I imagined. She's a Blake. The heir?" Richard's voice trailed off in astonishment.

“She lied to Alexander. I wonder if he'll divorce her," James said, his voice tinged with curiosity and concern.

"He won't," Richard replied with certainty. "They signed a contract stating the marriage would end in a year and six months, and it's only been a month. He's too bound by it to break it off now."

"What did you say? A contract?" James's voice rose in surprise. Richard explained the terms, the cold precision of their agreement,and how it had all been set in motion. "That explains a lot. But his behavior last night-that was different,"James continued, his tone reflecting the puzzle pieces he was still trying to fit together. "The Alexander I know wouldn't have acted that way over anyone,let alone a woman."


Sophia exchanged a concerned glance with Richard. "What do you mean?What did you see?"


"Alexander was upset, and not just upset-he was worried about her. He was willing to start a fight with the Blake family just to bring her back home. It's not like him, He never cared this much."

Richard's eyes narrowed. "Should we tell him?" he asked softly.

"I don't think we should," Sophia responded, her voice laced with caution."James made it clear that Lilly's secrets are off-limits."

"What are you two hiding? What is it that Alexander doesn't know?"James interrupted, the question hanging heavily in the air as he realized they had forgotten the phone was on speaker.

Richard sighed deeply, his voice resigned. "Lilly's pregnant. She's carrying Alexander's child."

A stunned silence followed. James finally broke it, his voice full of disbelief."What? That explains everything. No wonder he reacted the way he did."

The pieces were falling into place now. Alexander's cold exterior had cracked, not for Lilly's sake, but for the child growing inside her. But would he truly care for her, or was it all just the weight of responsibility that pulled him in? Lilly had spent the past few days alone in the mansion, trapped by her pregnancy and a rising sense of isolation. Alexander had left for a business trip,leaving her in the silence of their home, with only Clara's visits and her morning sickness for company. Sophia had advised her to stay indoors-this was the critical stage of her pregnancy, after all. But the stillness of her days only made the pressure build. The media buzzed with headlines about her identity,the missing daughter of the Blake family, her marriage to Alexander Kane, and the scandal that had unfolded. The negative comments flooded in from faceless accounts, all fueled by suspicion and judgment. Yet Lilly stayed silent, choosing not to retaliate. It wouldn't stop the rumors. it never did.

Her grandfather hadn't reached out. She hadn't expected himn to.There was nothing shecould say to fix what had happened. The silence between them was suffocating.

Then. as she picked up her bags and headed for the door, she froze. Two bodyguards stood near the entrance. Alexander had left early for his office,so why were they here?

Before she could ask, one of the guards stepped forward, blocking her path.

"What's going on here?" she asked, her tone sharp.

"The boss commanded that we ensure you don't stepoutside," one of them replied coolly.
Lilly's blood ran cold. She had been trapped in the house for days, and now, on the first day she decided to step out,she was stopped.Why?

Her heart raced, a growing sense of dread filling her chest as she realized the truth: Alexander's control over her life was far more absolute than she had ever imagined. And there was more to it-more than she understood.
###Chapter 34

"The boss has ordered us to prevent you from leaving the house."

The guard's words hit Lilly like a wall. Her voice,usually calm,sharpened with irritaion. "When exactly did he give this order?" she demanded.

"Since he left on his trip," came the curt reply.

Lilly blinked in disbelief. It had been over a week since Alexander left, and now, when she finally decided to step out, this? A smoldering anger ignited within her. She had endured days of confinement, morning sickness, and loneliness, all without a word from her husband. Today, she planned to meet Sarah and her friends, a small reprieve from the suffocating solitude. But now, she felt less like a wife and more like a prisoner.

Spinning on her heel, she stormed back upstairs to her room. The walls seemed to close in around her as she grabbed her phone and dialed Alexander. The line rang once before going unanswered. Gritting her teeth,she tried again. This time, the call was picked up-but not by Alexander.

"Hello, this is Alexander Kane's assistant. Who's calling?"

Lilly glanced at her phone, ensuring she hadn't misdialed. No, it was the right number. "Why are you answering Mr. Kane's phone?"
The assistant hesitated. "Ah, Miss Evans-sorry, Miss Blake," he corrected himself awkwardly. "Please put Mr. Kane on the phone," she demanded, her patience wearing thin. The assistant glanced nervously at his boss, who sat across the room, engrossed in his tablet. Alexander's fingers flew over the screen, his expression impassive yet intense.

"Hold on. Miss Blake. I'll check if he's available," the assistant replied.trying to keep his voice steady.

"Sir," he ventured cautiously.

"What is it?" Alexander's tone was clipped, his attention still on the screen.

"It's Miss Evans-er, Miss Blake," the assistant said, stumbling over her name.Since discovering her true identíty as the Blake family heir,addressing her as "Miss Evans" felt inappropriate.

Alexander's hands froze mid-gesture. His cold demeanor betrayed a flicker of something deeper. "Give me the phone," he ordered.

The assistant handed it over without a word.

"What's the purpose of this call?" Alexander's voice was as cold and sharp as steel.

Lilly's heart stuttered at the sound of him. It had been days since they'd spoken, but his voice still had the power to affect her. Could she ever stop loving this man who seemed so determined to remain distant?

"I..." She hesitated, then gathered her courage. "Why am I not allowed to leave the house? I've been cooped up for over a week, and now I find out you've ordered guards to stop me. Am I a prisoner?" Alexander leaned back in his chair, his expression hardening. "You are not leaving the house until I say so." Lilly's frustration boiled over. "You don't get to decide that for me! I'm
leaving today, whether you like it or not."

A muscle in Alexander's jaw twitched.′′Ifyou dare to leave, you'll regret it," he said, his tone laced with menace.

Lilly scoffed. "You're not even here to enforce your threats. Let's see if your guards can stop me."

Alexander's grip on the phone tightened. Her defiance, after all her lies,pushed him to the edge. "Try it, and see what happens," he warned,his voice dangerouasly low.

Without another word, Lilly ended the call.

Alexander stared at his phone, his mind a storm of emotions. Minutes later,it rang again.

"Speak," he barked.

"Sir," came the nervous voice of one of the guards, "Miss Evans has... has left the house."

"Did you touch her?" Alexander demanded,his tone like a whip.

"N-no, sir. She just... walked out," the guard stammered.

"Good. Don't lay a finger on her. I'll handle this myself," Alexander snapped before hanging up. He exhaled slowly, his icy facade cracking slightly. On his tablet, a wealth of information about Lilly lay open-details of her upbringing,her education, and even a long-hidden relationship during her second master's program. The pieces of her life, once obscured, were now clear. And then there were the threats. Her sisters had been murdered, and her identity as the Blake heir put her squarely in the crosshairs of whoever had killed them. The revelation that her life was in danger enraged him.She knew this and still dared to leave.

"James," Alexander barked.

"Yes,boss?"

"Cancel the meeting. We're going home."

James blinked but quickly complied, sensing the storm brewing in his employer's eyes.


Lilly stepped into the crisp air outside the mansion, defying the suffocating grip Alexander had imposed. Each step felt like a small victory, but her triumph was short-lived. The eyes of passersby and whispers in the air followed her, the weight of the public's scrutiny pressing down on her.

She hailed a cab and gave the driver the cafe address. As the car sped away, Lilly tried to ignore the gnawing sensation that she was being watched.


Back at the mansion, Alexander's car screeched to a halt in the driveway.His expression was thunderous as he exited, his usual composure shattered.

"Where is she?" he demanded of the guard at the gate.
 
"She left, sir. Took a cab," the guard replied, trembling. Alexander's jaw clenched. He could track her easily-her movements,her location, everything. But it wasn't just about control. It was about her safety. The threats to her life were real, and her recklessness infuriated him.Lilly arrived at the café, her heart finally settling. She needed the company of friends, a reprieve from the tension that had consumed her life. But even in the warmth of her friends' laughter, she couldn't shake the feeling that she had crossed a line-a line that Alexander wouldn't let her forget.

Meanwhile,Alexander sat in his car outside, his anger simmering.He wouldn't storm in; that wasn't his style. But when she returned home,he would be waiting.

Waiting to remind her that the world she had stepped into was far more dangerous than she realized. And that leaving his protection had consequences-ones she wasn't prepared to face.
###Chapter 35

Lilly wasn't sure what she had expected when she walked into the coffee shop that afternoon, but seeing Michael and Jacob sitting with Sarah was a surprise. The shop was officially closed for the day, yet the familiar space felt like a refuge.

"Lilly!" Sarah greeted her warmly and pulled her into a hug. Michael and Jacob stood to do the same.

"You look stunning, Lilly," Sarah said with a grin. "And is it just me, or have you gained a little weight? Pregnancy suits you."

Lilly blinked, momentarily caught off guard. Her hand instinctively went to her cheeks. "Do I really?"

Sarah nodded enthusiastically.

A soft smile tugged at Lilly's lips as her hand drifted to her still-flat stomach. The idea of carrying Alexander's child was both overwhelming and oddly comforting, a flicker of warmth amidst the chaos.

"This baby will be beautiful." Jacob chimed in, his tone playful yet sincere.
"With parents like you two, it's practically guaranteed.”

Lilly chuckled, picturing a little boy with Alexander's piercing eyes and sharp features. But the lighthearted moment didn't last long. Michael,who had been watching her intently, finally spoke. "Lilly,now that your stepmother and sister know you're alive, you're in real danger.You need to limit your outings and make sure you always have bodyguards with you.Alexander has plenty of them-use them." His words landed like a stone, shifting the mood entirely. "Michael, she's been cooped up for ten days." Sarah interjected, rolling her eyes. "Let her breathe. Don't act like an overprotective brother."

Michael ignored her. "Alexander's estate is massive, practically a small town. You can walk, exercise, even ride horses there without ever stepping outside the gates. You don't need to go out. And, Lilly, you have to tell Alexander everything. He deserves to know the risks, especially with his child involved. You're hiding the truth about your situation, and if something happens, he won't forgive you."

Lilly said nothing. She sipped her coffee, her expression unreadable.

Michael's voice softened. “Lilly, Alexander is the only one with enough power to protect you properly. This isn't about pride or independence.It's about survival."


“He's right." Sarah admitted reluctantly. “Alexander probably already suspects something. He knows about your sisters' deaths and that you were hiding because you were next. Do you really think he'll let you face this alone?"


Lilly's finagers tightened around her cup. Of course, Alexander knew.He always knew more than he let on.


When she finally returned to the estate later that day, her heart sank at the sight of Alexander's sleek black car parked out front. He wasn't supposed to be back so soon. The house seemed unnaturally quiet as she slipped through the front door.Her heart raced as she decided to take the stairs instead of the elevator,hoping to avoid him altogether. She was halfway up when his voice cut through the silence. “Come here."

Her breath hitched. She considered pretending she hadn't heard him but knew it would only make things worse. Slowly, she descended the stairs and made her way toward the living room, plastering a bright smile on her face.

"You're back," she said, her tone light and casual.

Alexander sat in an armchair, his expression cold and unreadable. He motioned for her to come closer.

Lilly hesitated, then moved to the couch across from him.

"Closer," he barked.

Her smile faltered as she reluctantly stood and walked around the coffee table,sitting next to him.

"Closer," he repeated, his voice lower but no less commanding.

Before she could react, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her to her feet.The distance between them vanished, and his grip was firm, almost bruising.

"When I say you're not to leave the house, you obey," he said, his voice cold and deliberate."You are carrying my child, and the world knows who you are. Do you understand the danger you've put yourself in?" Lilly stared at him, her heart pounding. His icy gaze bore into hers, and for the first time, she saw something darker lurking beneath his calm exterior. “Don't make me show you what I'm capable of, Lilly," he warned."You don't want to see that side of me."

A shiver ran down her spine.

He released her wrist abruptly and turned to leave. Lilly cradled her wrist,wincing at the pain. She wanted to hate him for his harshness,but deep down, she knew he was right. She had taken a reckless risk, and the consequences could have been far worse.

The next morning, the tension between them was palpable. Alexander had ordered her to come down for breakfast, and she complied reluctantly. She sat at the table, picking at her food in silence.

He noticed her bruised wrist and frowned."Why didn't you bandage your hand?”

She glanced at him, her expression defiant. “Because I wasn't the one who bruised it," she said simply before returning her attention to her plate.

His jaw tightened. "Finish your food, then go upstairs and change. You're coming with me."

Lilly looked up, surprised."Where are we going?”

Alexander's lips curved into a cold smile. “Aren't you desperate to leave the house?”
###Chapter 36

"Where is he taking me?" Lilly's mind raced with questions as Alexander's command echoed in her ears. He hadn't offered a single clue as to their destination, but one thing was clear-he wasn't going to wait for her to ask more.


"Get ready, I don't have all day.”

The urgency in his voice echoed in her mind as she turned and ascended the stairs, her mind in a whirlwind. What was going on? The past few days had felt like one long blur of confusion and fear. She had barely had time to process the mounting questions about her identity, her marriage,and the mysteries surrounding her sisters' deaths. And now, just when she thought she might get a moment of normalcy, Alexander had pulled her into something even deeper.

In her room. Lilly stood before her wardrobe, trying to decide on an outfit that would fit whatever agenda Alexander had planned. Her heart pounded with unease as she sifted through her options. After a moment's hesitation, she chose a white trouser suit paired with a cream silk blouse.The fabric was light and elegant, yet practical enough for anything.She tucked one side of the blouse into the waistband, giving it a slightly casual but stylish flair. Modest black heels completed the look, and she slung a black Birkin bag over her shoulder. When she caught her reflection in the mirror, Lilly allowed herself a small,almost imperceptible smile. She looked ready for anything, be it a formal meeting or something more casual. But what was Alexander up to? And why did he seem so cold, so unyielding whenever he spoke to her? Her fingers brushed over her bruised wrist-the reminder of their previous encounter-and her mind briefly wandered back to the painful tension between them. Rosa had bought her a bandage the night before, offering to help her, but Lilly had declined. She wanted to handle this herself, even if the physical ache mirrored the emotional turmoil she was carrying. She wasn't ready to give in to him, not yet.

Lilly grabbed the bandage anid carefully wrapped it around her wrist before walking back downstairs. As she entered the dining room,she found Alexander already seated, his eyes buried in a newspaper. He didn't look up as she approached, but she could feel his gaze on her, examining her every move.

"I'm ready," she said, standing at the doorway.

Without looking up, Alexander set the paper down and studied her from head to toe. His gaze lingered on her wrist for a moment.

"Why isn't your wrist bandaged?" he asked, his voice flat.

Lilly held out her hand, the bandage resting in her palm.“Why don't you do it for me, Mr. Kane?” Her words were laced with an edge, her defiance creeping back, despite her lingering fear.

He studied her for a moment longer, then took the bandage from her hand.His fingers brushed against her skin as he wrapped it carefully around her wrist, and Lilly couldn't help but notice how precise his touch was.There was something almost.., intimate abo uit it, though she couldn't quite place why. With her wrist bandaged, Alexander stood, his cold eyes locking with hers."Let's go.” She followed him out to the car, confusion still lingering in her chest. She hadn't expected this, but she couldn't refuse. She could feel the tension between them, thick and palpable, as the bodyguards flanked them on all sides. The world outside felt like a distant dream as they moved through the estate gates and into the streets.

It wasn't until they arrived at the sleek glass building of Alexander's company headquarters that she realized where they were going. Her heart skipped a beat, and she felt a wave of unease wash over her. Of course,he would bring her to work-she was his wife now, after all. But why? What was his endgame? Did he want to show her off, or was he preparing for something darker?


They walked toward the building, the bodyguards creating a protective barrier around them. And then, it happened-reporters appeared out of nowhere, cameras flashing and microphones thrust toward them.

“Mr. Kane is here, and with him is his wife, Lilly Blake," one reporter called out, his voice booming.

Lilly froze, her stomach twisting into a knot. She had been avoiding the media for days now, ever since her identity had been revealed. But now,it seemed, there was no escape. The questions came fast and furious,each one more intrusive than the last.

"Why did you marry Lilly Blake? Was it to unite both families and strengthen their power?" another reporter asked, his voice dripping with suspicion. "Did you marry her to gain your grandfather's property meant for charity?"another added, their wvords cutting deep. But it was the next question that made Lilly's blood run cold.
 "Lilly, why did you disappear after your sisters died? Did you feel responsible for their deaths?"

Her breath caught in her throat. She hadn't expected them to dredge up her past like this. The mention of her sisters-her sisters who had died in such mysteriouis circumstances-was too much. She clenched her jaw and fought to maintain her composure.

"You used a fake name, Lilly Evans, and married Mr. Kane under that alias. Why? Doesn't that make you a fraud?" another reporter shouted,the accusation hanging in the air like a threat.

Lilly's mind spiraled as she tried to keep her emotions in check. But Alexander was quick to act, grabbing her hand and pulling her close as they walked into the building, his bodyguards keeping the reporters at bay.

Inside the elevator, Lilly couldn't help but notice the way their hands were still entwined. She pulled her hand away, her heart beating faster with each passing second.

“Did you know the reporters would be there?" she asked, her voice tight with suspicion.“How did they know I was coming with you unless you told them?”


Alexander's expression darkened. His grip on her hand tightened, forcing her to face him. "What did you just say?" he demanded,his voice low and threatening. Lilly's emotions surged, but she stood her ground. "Why were there suddenly reporters? How did they know?" His eyes narrowed. For a moment, he said nothing, his gaze searing into hers. Then, just as the elevator doors opened,he released her hand and stepped out, waiting for her to follow.

Lilly stood in the elevator, her breath coming in shallow bursts. She didn't want to confront him, not now-not with the tension between them thick and unresolved. But she couldn't ignore the gnawing feeling that something wasn't right.

Finally,she pressed the button for the top floor, her mind racing as the elevator ascended. Was he setting her up? Was this some twisted game he was playing?

The elevator doors slid open, and Alexander was already waiting, his back to her, his hands clenched at his sides.

Lilly stepped out slowly, but before she could make a move, he turned to face her, his expression cold. "Step out," he ordered his voice like ice.

"I don't want to talk to you right now," Lilly snapped, pressing the button for the top floor once again.

But Alexander's piercing gaze never left her as the doors closed between them.

Upstairs, Lilly sat on the rooftop, alone with her thoughts. As she scrolled through the media reports on her phone, her mind wandered to the people who could have orchestrated all of this-the people who had been manipulating her life from the shadows. Her stepmother, her sister-were they behind this?

She dialed Matthew's number. "Hello, ma'am,” Matthew's voice answered. "Matthew," Lilly said, her tone serious. "I need you to find out everything my stepmother and sister have been doing for the past ten days."

"Right away, ma'am. I'll find out if they were involved."

Lilly hung up, taking a deep breath as she looked out at the city skyline.The silence on the rooftop was broken only by the sound of footsteps approaching. She turned to find Alexander standing just a few feet away,his gaze unwavering.

"Who is Matthew?" he asked, his voice low and dangerous. "What are you investigating about your stepmother and sister? You'd better tell me what you've been up to, Lilly."

Lilly's heart skipped a beat. She had hoped to keep this to herself,but now she was trapped, and she knew it. The truth was out-no more hiding. The stakes had never been higher.
###Chapter 37

Kate leaned back in her chair, a grin creeping across her face as she scrolled through the negative comments about Lilly online. The satisfaction in watching her enemy's reputation crumble was almost too much to bear.Lilly had always been the one standing in her way, and now, it seemed,fate had finally started to tip in her favor. The internet was buzzing with scathing remarks, and Kate could hardly believe how easily it was all falling into place. She knew Lilly's return to the family was imminent.Lilly would want to reclaim her position as the heir, and when that happened.Kate had every intention of ensuring she would have nothing but a tarnished name left.

Kate smirked to herself. She had paid a small army of faceless people to post vile comments online. It wasn't hard. People loved a scandal,especially when it involved someone like Lilly. The video of Lilly being hounded by reporters only added fuel to the fire. As she watched, Kate's sense of satisfaction deepened-until her eyes narrowed at the sight of Alexander's hand wrapped possessively around Lilly's. That's when the smile on Kate's face faltered.

Alexander's devotion to Lilly made her stomach churn. But it was only temporary, Kate reassured herself. Alexander would never tolerate a wife with a damaged reputation, not when he valued status and control above all else. Once Lilly's name was completely ruined, it would only be a matter of time before Alexander filed for divorce. Then, everything would fall into place. Still, one thing remained nagging at the back of Kate's mind-what was the real reason behind Alexander's marriage to Lilly? How had they even met? Kate wasn't one to leave a mystery unsolved. She would find the answers, sooner or later. But before she could go deeper into her thoughts, a loud bang on her door made her jump.

"Who dares interrupt me?" Kate muttered, already feeling the weight of irritation mounting. She spun in her chair, only to find her mother, Bella,entering the room with a look that could kill.

"Mother?" Kate's voice dripped with false sweetness. "Why did you barge in like that?"


Bella's glare could've burned a hole through steel. "I warned you to stay out of Lilly's business. I told you I'd handle her, but here you are,going behind my back."

Kate scoffed,crossing her arms.“Did you expect me to sit back and watch while Lilly takes what belongs to me?" Her voice was a venomous hiss,but Bella wasn't phased.

“You think I don't know what you've been up to?" Bella's voice was low,dangerous. “I know you're the one who paid for all those comments, and I know you orchestrated today's little spectacle with the reporters. You've been reckless."

Kate froze, her heart skipping a beat. "What do you mean?"

“Alexander Kane already figured it out. He found out who paid those reporters." Bella's words were like ice, and Kate's blood ran cold."And let me tell you, if I hadn't acted quickly, if I hadn't sent someone to silence the person who blabbed, he'd be coming for you next.” Kate's mouth went dry, her mind racing. If Alexander knew it was her,it was only a matter of time before everything unraveled. “What are we going to do?” she whispered, clutching Bella's hand in panic. Bella's expression softened, but only slightly. “You should be thanking me. I took care of it. But next time, use your brain before you act. If Alexander finds out it was you, you'll be done."

Kate's shoulders sagged in relief. "Thank you, Mother. I don't know what I'd do without you."

Bella patted her daughter's hair lovingly. "We're in this together, Kate.Don't forget that."

Kate leaned into her mother's embrace for a moment, allowing herself to relax. She'd dodged a bullet this time, but she knew this wasn't over.The war was just beginning.

But then Bella's voice broke through her thoughts,sharp and calculating.“By the way, how did you know Lilly would be with Alexander at the company today?”

Kate's lips curled into a smirk. “I didn't know. It just worked out that way. I suppose some things are just meant to fall into place." She couldn't hide the satisfaction in her tone. Seeing Lilly squirm under the weight of public scrutiny had been too perfect.
Suddenly, a thought hit Kate, and she shot her mother a wicked smile.“Mother. I just remembered something important. Lilly married Alexander under a fake name-'Evans.' She lied to him. She's been deceiving him from the start." Bella's eyes narrowed as she processed this new piece of information.“So she's been lying about who she is this whole time. That's interesting...” "I need you to hurry up with the investigation," Kate urged. "If we expose her for that, we can destroy her completely." Bella raised a hand to silence her, "My men are already on it. But Kate. you need to stop making this personal. If you don't want Alexander to see you as Lilly's enemy, try being nice to her for once. You don't want him to see how badly you've been trying to sabotage her. If you play this right,you'll earn your grandfather's approval. Just let me handle the heavy lifting."


Kate didn't like the idea of playing nice with Lilly, but she had no choice.Her mother's words made sense, and for once, she decided to put her personal vendetta aside for a greater goal. “Fine, I'll try. But it won't be easy.”

"Good," Bella said, her voice a low murmur as she walked to the bar and poured herself a drink.

As she took a sip, Kate couldn't help but feel a spark of excitement."Guess what, Mother?" she asked, her voice full of glee.

Bella raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "What?"

"My company has a meeting with Alexander Kane tomorrow. He's considering a partnership with us." Kate's eyes gleamed. “I'll see him tomorrow. This will start as a business relationship, but it will lead to something more. I'm going to make sure of it.”

Bella's lips curved into a knowing smile."Then we should make a toast." Meanwhile, Lilly sat in Alexander's office, her thoughts tangled in knots.The weight of secrets was starting to weigh on her shoulders, but she wasn't ready to tell Alexander the truth. Not yet. Her sisters' deaths were still an open wound, and she wasn't prepared to expose everything. But the more she thought about it, the more she questioned her silence. Was it time to tell him? Would Alexander understand, or would he take matters into his own hands? She glanced at him, lost in thought as he sat behind his executive desk,his focus unwavering. But when he noticed her staring, he didn't look at her with concern. Instead, his expression was cold and calculating.

"The more you delay serving your punishment, the harsher it will be,"Alexander's voice sliced through the silence, pulling Lilly back to the present.


Lilly blinked, caught off guard by his words. She hadn't expected this. She'd thought her punishment would be more severe, but instead, it was this-a simple, mind-numbing task of sorting documents.She could get through this easily. It was nothing compared to the torture her grandfather had put her through as a child. But Alexander's presence, the way he watched her every move, made her feel like a caged animal.

As she worked through the documents, the hours passed by in silence.Alexander left the office for meetings, but his presence lingered in the air,heavy and oppressive. When he returned, the tension in the room was almost unbearable. Lilly could feel his eyes on her, judging her every movement.

At 4 PM, her stomach rumbled-she hadn't eaten all day. The hunger was almost unbearable, but there was no time to think about it. She was still stuck in the office,sorting through piles of paperwork. As she wandered over to Alexander's desk, her gaze fell on a file. Curiosity tugged at her,and before she knew it, she was flipping through its contents. The project was a mess. Flaws at every turn. As she marked the errors in red,she found more and more mistakes until it became clear-this project was a disaster. Lilly quickly scanned the other files, finding the same pattern of incompetence. Only one file was relatively clean, but even that had a minor flaw. She wasn't sureif Alexander would notice-or if he would fire someone on the spot.

Just as she was about to finish marking the final file, the door to the office clicked open. Lilly quickly straightened up and returned to her seat, just as Alexander entered. His eyes immediately flicked to the sorted documents,then to the files on his desk.


"That was fast," he said, his voice laced with skepticism.

"It's not my first time with this kind of task," Lilly replied evenly,though her insides were churning.

Alexander's gaze shifted to the files again, and something about his demeanor changed. His eyes narrowed, and his lips twitched as if he were about to say something.

Before he could, Lilly's stomach gave another growl, louder this time. The sound seemed to cut through the tension, and Alexander's gaze snapped to her.

"Why haven't you eaten yet?" His voice was sharp,almost accusatory.

Lilly couldn't stop herself. “Aren't you the one who put me on punishment?" She shot back, trying to mask the hunger that was clawing at her. "It's entirely your fault that I and your baby are hungry." The words left her lips before she could stop them, and as soon as they did, the room went deathly silent. Alexander's eyes darkened. But before Lilly could make another move, the air between them thickened with unspoken tension. What had she just done?
###Chapter 38

Lilly's eyes sparkled as she gazed at the spread before her, an assortment of dishes she hadn't expected to find in Alexander's office. Seated at a small, hidden diningtable tucked away in a corner of the room, she couldn't help but marvel at the surprise. She hadn't noticed this part of the office before, and it seemed as though Alexander had spent nights here,perhaps alone, before their marriage. A mini kitchen,a resting room-it was an oasis in the midst of his otherwise cold, corporate world.

The scent of the food wafted up, inviting and fragrant, and Lilly felt her stomach settle-no longer churned by nerves. She had grown used to the taste of tension, but now, the warm aroma was a welcome distraction.Alexander made a casual call, and within thirty minutes,the food arrived.

"Why are you just staring at it? Eat," Alexander's voice broke through her thoughts. He sat across from her, flicking through the files she'd marked earlier. She had a sinking feeling he'd seen what she'd written.

Without hesitation, Lilly picked up her utensils and began to eat,savoring each bite. "This tastes amazing," she murmured, her curiosity piqued. "Do you mind telling me where it's from?"

"No," Alexander replied flatly, his eyes glued to the papers before him.

"Why not?" Lilly pouted, her gaze drifting back to the food.

Without missing a beat, Alexander pointed to the markedt-up file. "You did this?" Lilly glanced down, realizing he must have reviewed the documents and noticed the corrections she'd made."Yes. I marked the errors. The one that says 'Redo' needs to be rejected, the 'manageable' one is good but needs work, and the rest need major revisions."

Alexander glanced at the marked file titled "Redo," then back at the one labeled "manageable." His brow furrowed, a small flicker of annoyance crossing his face. "You said this one is manageable?"

Lilly hesitated, unsure of the sudden shift in his demeanor. "Yes, their plan is solid overall, but their cost projections and land requirements are off. It's salvageable with some corrections."

He studied her for a moment before nodding. As much as it irritated him,he had to admit she was right. At first glance, he would have tossedI the projects aside, but she was trying to give the companiesa second chance.However, something about her defense of the 'manageable' company nagged at him. "Do you know whose company this is?" he asked, his voice dropping slightly.

Lilly shook her head, confusion crossing her features. "No, I don't."

"And this one?" Alexander's eyes never left hers as he pointed to the 'Redo'file.

Lilly's eyes darted between the files and his piercing gaze, her pulse quickening. "No," she answered, her voice softer than before.

Alexander's stare lingered for a beat longer than necessary, the tension palpable. He seemed to be weighing her every word, his thoughts unreadable. "Since you want to give them a second chance," he said, breaking the silence, "why don't you attend the meetings with me tomorrow and evaluate the projects yourself? After all, you know exactly where they went wrong." Lilly blinked, taken aback by the unexpected offer. She hadn't expected him to actually involve her in the meetings. But a thrill ran through her at the thought of returning to the world she'd once been a part of-before everything had changed. "I'd love to," she said, her voice light with excitement. "But just so we're cear, I'm not your employee. Is it alright if I speak on behalf of the projects?"

"You'll be acting as a business consultant," he replied coolly,his expression unreadable. "And that's final."


Lilly nodded, a grin forming on her lips. She hadn't expected him to give in so easily. She was eager to get back into the swing of things, to prove that she still had a sharp mind for business, despite the years spent in exile.


"Alright," Alexander said, standing up from the table. "We'll leave in an hour."


Before she could respond, he turned to leave. A question lingered on the tip of her tongue, but the moment he walked out, she dismissed it. There would be time for that later.

An hour later, as they made their way home, Alexander's phone rang. Lilly's curiosity piqued when she heard the word "Grandma" echo through the car. "Grandma," Alexander answered with a polite tone, though Lilly could tell by his voice that he'd already known the conversation would take a predictable turn. "Did Sandra tell you she's finally coming back in three days?" Grandma's voice sounded on the other end, her words sharp and filled with irritation."I can't believe she didn't inform you!" Alexander feigned ignorance. "She is? I dlidn't know."

Grandma huffed. "I'm going to give her a piece of my mind when she returns. You make sure she knows how much she's missed out on!"

Alexander nodded, though he couldn't suppress the smile tugging at his lips. He knew his grandmother well. "Alright,Grandma."

"And how's Lilly?" Grandma continued, the tone of her voice softening. "I've missed her."

Alexander glanced at Lilly, who was looking at him curiously. She could hear every word from the speakerphone, and it was clear that his grandmother had a special place in her heart for Lilly.

"She's fine," Alexander answered, his gaze never leaving Lilly's.

"Is she there with you?" Grandma pressed.

"No," Alexander replied smoothly. "She's at home resting."

"Make sure to pamper her," Grandma warned. "If she ever complains to me,I'll give you an earful!"

The call ended with a chuckle from Alexander,though Lilly couldn't help but smile at the exchange. Grandma Helen always had her back.

Just as the car turned onto the familiar road leading home, Lilly's phone rang, the caller ID displaying a name she wasn't prepared for. "Michael?" Alexander asked, his sharp eyes flicking to her, a subtle edge to his voice. "Who's that?" Lilly's stomach clenched, and she quickly hit 'decline.' "A friend," she said,sending a quick text instead. "A friend?" Alexander's tone darkened. "Explain."

Lilly's heart pounded in her chest as she considered how much to tell him.She had always been upfront about Michael, but the look in Alexander's eyes made her second-guess everything. "We met in school," she began,her voice steady. "He came to the country with me. That's all."


Alexander's expression soured. "HHe left his country and came with you?"

Lilly sighed, growing weary of the questions. "You're still qquestioning me,even after all this time? We agreed not to meddle in each other's lives, but you're doing the exact opposite."


The silence that followed was suffocating. Alexander's gaze turned icy, and for a moment, Lilly felt like she was under fire. The tension thickened.Why was he so bothered by Michael? The question lingered in the air,unanswered.


And then, before she could breathe a sigh of relief, Alexander spoke, his voice low and dangerous.


"I'm going to have James look into him."


Lilly froze, her blood running cold. What was he planning to uncover about Michael? What would he find? The unease in her stomach grew as she wondered how far Alexander would go to control every part of her life.
###Chapter 39

The following day, Lilly dressed with purpose. She slipped into a sleek black pencil skirt that ended just above her knees, the fabric hugging her curves with an elegance that felt powerful yet restrained. Her silk blouse,neatly tucked into the waistband, added a touch of refinement. She finished the look with modest heels, the subtle click of them echoing as she moved. Her hair, pulled into a ponytail, cascaded down her back, a soft.controlled wave. A quick swipe of makeup, just enough to accentuate her features, and she was ready.


Excitement surged within her at the thought of the project consultation meeting ahead. It had been so long since she'd immersed herself in the world of business, and this felt like the perfect opportunity to step back into it.


As she made her way downstairs, she found Alexander at the breakfast table, something unusually hearty in front of him. For once, he was not consuming his usual tea and newspaper, but a substantial meal. Lilly greeted him with a cheerful, "Good morning," but he only nodded in acknowledgment, his attention focused elsewhere. She noticed a flicker of approval in his gaze as he looked her over,clearly pleased with her attire.

After breakfast, a maid quickly served her meal, and they were off to the office. During the drive, curiosity gnawed at her. She didn't know anything about the companies whose projects she would be reviewing. "Mr. Kane," she called,breaking the silence. He glanced at her briefly. "What is it?" "Istill don't know anything about the companies that submitted those projects," she admitted, her voice tinged with uncertainty.

Alexander was silent for a moment, his gaze fixed on the passing scenery outside the window. "You'll be briefed during the meeting," he said, his tone clipped.


Lilly felt a knot form in her stomach. How could she understand the full scope of each company's project in just one meeting? She couldn't remember the abbreviations on the files, nor had she taken the time to look them up the day before. She had failed to prepare.


Upon arrival at the office, they entered through the main entrance for the first time, the lobby filled wvith employees going about their tasks. A few people whispered under their breath as they caught sight of Lilly.

"She's even more beautiful in person," one employee remarked in awe.

"She must have something special to be the heir to the Blake empire,"another added in hushed tones.


Yesterday, they had taken a different route to avoid the media, but today,Alexander walked with confidence, unaware-or perhaps uncaring-of the gazes and whispers following them. Lilly walked at his side, her heels clicking against the polished floor, tho ugh the sting of judgment lingered in the air. Inside the elevator, Alexander remained focused, and Lilly lagged behind,struggling to keep up with his brisk pace. James, walking beside them,noticed the slight delay and turned to her. "Sir, the meeting will start in an hour. Do you want to go to the meeting room or your office first?" Alexander, his gaze sharp and unwavering, stopped, turned to face her.James followed suit, both men seemingly aware of her slower pace. The briefest flicker ofsomething passed through Alexander's eyes, but he remained impassive. He spoke before she could react. "We'll go to the meeting room first."


"We?" James asked, raising an eyebrow, clearly confused.

Lilly smiled faintly at James's surprised expression. She was equally taken aback by the turn of events. "Yes, I'm attending the meeting," she answered, her voice confident, but with a touch of uncertainty beneath it.

James's face showed pure shock. "But... why? You don't even know anything about the projects."

Lilly's smile widened in response to his baffled expression. Before she could say anything else, Alexander's cold voice sliced through the tension."James, I want you to fire every employee who gossiped about us in my presence today. Make sure they never find a job elsewhere."

"Right away, sir," James responded, his voice stiff with compliance.

Lilly's heart skipped a beat. "Why fire them? They didn't say anything bad," she asked, her tone filled with genuine confusion.
Alexander's eyes, hard as steel, met hers for a moment before he answered with chilling detachment. "Let's go." His words were final, leaving no room for argument. Lilly had no choice but to follow, the weight of his command pressing on her chest. Inside the spacious meeting room, Lilly was handed a file with details about the companies they would be meeting with. As she flipped through the documents, reading through the first few entries with interest,something caught her eye. The last two companies were particularly striking-both projects marked in ways that felt far too familiar. Her eyes fell on the first one. ALCorp. She froze. The project she had marked "manageable" was from none other than Albert Lee's company.Her ex-boyfriend. The realization hit her like a wave, and her breath caught in her throat. She glanced up at Alexander, seated at the head of the table, but his gaze was cold,unreadable.

"Is there a problem?" he asked in a voice that sounded deceptively casual,though there was an undercurrent of something more dangerous in his tone. He knew. He had to have known it was Albert's company, yet he still insisted on her attending the meeting.

"Nothing," she said, forcing her voice to remain steady. Her pulse quickened, but she forced herself to focus on the task at hand.

She quickly moved to the last project. Her stomach churned. Blake Real Estate. The project she had marked "Redo." And then it clicked. It was her stepsister's company-the one that had been rushed, the one that lacked attention to detail. Her heart pounded in her chest as she connected the dots. Both companies were tied to her past, and now, she would be expected to evaluate them impartially.

She looked up at Alexander again. He was staring at her, his gaze unwavering. It was as though he was studying her, waiting for a reaction.His eyes flicked briefly to James, and then he spoke, his voice low but clear.
"We'll start with the Blake Real Estate company," he declared,his tone brokering no argument. James,seemingly caught off guard, nodded quickly and motioned to the coordinators. "Please bring Kate and her team in." Lilly's heart thudded in her chest as she watched the door open moments later.Kate entered with a practiced smile on her face, but when her eyes landed on Lilly sitting beside Alexander, her expression faltered.The smile vanished in an instant, replaced by a tense, clenched jaw.

Kate's eyes narrowed, her fists tightening at her sides as she took in the sight of Lilly. What was she doing here? The question was written all over Kate's face, and Lilly could feel the weight of her stepsister's gaze,sharp with something that bordered on hostility.

The tension in the room thickened. Lilly had no idea what Kate was thinking, but she could feel it in the air-the simmering undercurrent of animosity.

And then, just as the silence reached its peak, Alexander spoke, his voice calm but with a dangerous edge. "Let's begin."


Lilly's breath caught in her throat. What would happen next? How would Kate react tothe scrutiny? And, more importantly, what was Alexander really planning by putting Lilly in this position-surrounded by her past,forced to navigate a web of complications she hadn't prepared for?

The stakes had just gotten much higher.
###Chapter 40

The moment Kate walked into the meeting room, her earlier confidence evaporated. Her eyes immediately found Lilly, sitting beside Alexander at the head of the table. Lilly's expression was neutral, her eyes sharp and unreadable as she met Kate's gaze, offering nothing that would betray recognition. The weight of the silence was thick between them.

"Ms. Blake, they're ready for us," Kate's assistant murmured,noting her momentary shock. Kate quickly snapped out of her daze, forcing a smile as she mentally recalled her mother's words: Be cordial with Lilly. Win over her favor,and you win the family.

"Good morning, everyone," Kate began, her voice smooth and professional."I am the CEO of Blake Real Estate, and I'm eager to discuss the potential for a partnership with Kane Realty." She took a moment to let her words sink in, then moved toward the designated seat. The team followed,their eyes briefly flicking to Lilly before they sat down opposite her.

Kate flashed Lilly a bright, calculated smile, her gaze lingering,but Lilly remained stone-faced, her eyes narrowing ever so slightly. The silent tension between them was palpable. Kate then turned her charm on Alexander,who was observing the room with a detached air. Lilly caught it-ahint of something deeper in his eyes, like he was silently scrutinizing the very atmosphere. “Thank you for considering our proposal, Mr. Kane,” Kate continued, her tone purposeful, designed to convey respect yet laced with an underlying hope for approval. She glanced over at him, but Alexander's gaze remained unreadable. His lips only parted to issue a cold, matter-of-fact reply: "Let's wait until your project is reviewed before you thank me." Kate's smile faltered briefly, but she recovered quickly, gesturing for her team to begin the presentation. The lights dimmed as they activated the projector, and the room fell into a focused silence, all eyes on the screen.

Lilly sat back, her posture composed, her attention unwavering. She was completely still, almost too still, but Alexander noticed. She was watching-not just observing, but calculating. After a few minutes, the lights flicked back on, and Kate, feeling the weight of Alexander's silent presence,turned to him.


"What do you think, Mr. Kane?" she asked, her tone now tinged with uncertainty.


Alexander's gaze slid to Lilly, his eyes narrowing with a quiet intensity."What are your thoughts?" he asked, his voice a quiet command that sent a ripple of surprise through the roomn. Kate's smile faltered for a moment,not expecting him to turn the conversation to Lilly so quickly.

Lilly's gaze flicked up to meet Alexander's, and for a heartbeat, time seemed to stretch. She picked up the project file and slid it across the table toward Kate. The sharp sound of paper brushing against the table broke the silence.

Kate glanced down at the file, and immediately, her expression shifted from confusion to recognition. “What's this about?" she asked,her voice strained. "Open it and find out," Lilly replied coolly, her tone so calm it was almost unnerving. The room held its breath as everyone watched the exchange-this was more than just business now. This was personal. Kate's fingers trembled slightly as she flipped open the file. Her face drained of color as she scanned the pages. Red marks. The bold “Redo" stamped at the end of the last page. "How dare you?"she muttered under her breath. The irritation boiled in her chest, but she masked it quickly.

"This project is a mess," Lilly said, her voice dripping with scorn.′′Ilacks proper planning, and the presentation only made it worse. You should be embarrassed," she added, her eyes cold.

Kate fought to keep her composure, but the anger was evident in her clenched jaw. She turned toward Alexander, desperate to salvage something. "Mr. Kane," she began, her voice more measured but tight with frustration. "Our company has a stellar record, numerous successful government projects. You can trust us."

Lilly's laughter, sharp and unexpected, rang out, slicing through Kate's words like a blade. The room stiffened at the sound, and even Alexander's expression flickered with a hint of curiosity.

"Trust you?" Lilly said, her voice dripping with irony. “Don't you even know how the Blake empire works? And you think you can just waltz in here,presenting something this flawed, and expect us to take you seriously?"She leaned forward, her eyes narrowing. “Didn't our grandfather tell you that those 'stellar' projects were approved by me-and my late sisters?”

The silence that followed was suffocating. Kate's face twisted in disbelief,her hands shaking with barely restrained rage. The room seemed to shrink under the weight of the unspoken challenge. Alexander, ever the observer.watched the drama unfold with his usual detachment, but even he couldn't ignore the tension cr ackling between the two women. Kate tried to salvage her dignity, her voice now clipped and defensive."Grandfather had many consultants," she shot back, her words biting. "What makes you think it was your work?" Lilly's eyes darkened, the calmness in her expression now laced with something dangerous. "You still don't understand, do you?" she said quietly, her voice almost a whisper. "I am the heir. I'm the one who mnade those decisions. And if you're still questioning it, maybe you should do your homework."


The room froze. Kate's lips parted, her retort dying on her tongue. She wanted to argue, to find a way to turn the tables, but the facts were laid bare, and they weren't in her favor. Lilly had just crushedI any hope of salvaging her reputation at that moment.

"This is your first project, and it's a failure," Lilly continued, her voice calm but final. "I'm disappointed. What do you think Grandfather would say about this?"


Kate's face turned a shade of crimson. The room held its collective breath,waiting for her to snap. But she didn't. She clenched her fists, her shoulders stiff witha humiliation. She knew she had lost.

But Lilly, in a rare moment of grace, offered a lifeline. "I'll give you a second chance," she said, her tone surprisingly gentle. "Draft a new contract, and if it meets my standards, I'll approve it."

Alexander's gaze shifted to Llly, a small glimmer of admiration flickering in his eyes. He remained silent, but his approval was clear.Kate,seething,could hardly contain her rage, but she had no choice but to nod in reluctant agreement.


"Fine," Kate spat, her voice low. "But this isn't over." With that, she stormed out of the room, her heels clicking loudly on the polished floor, a thunderous declaration of her fury. As soon as the door slammed shut behind her, Lilly leaned back in her chair,exhaling slowly. She had expected resistance, but the venom in Kate's reaction had caught her off guard.


Out in the hallway, far from the meeting room. Kate was a different person."We have a chance to redo it. We should be grateful," she muttered to herself, her hands cleniched into fists. But the fury didn't fade. It only grew.


She turned to her team, her voice low but seething. "It was my sister,not Mr. Kane! She plans to humiliate me again-again! But this time, I'll make sure she knows her place."


Her smirk was cold, calculating. "You won this time, Lilly," Kate wvhispered,her voice a promise, "But next time... I'll be the one in control."


And as she walked away, the echoes of her words hung in the air, an ominous reminder that the battle between them was far from over
###Chapter 41

"Sir, the next company on the agenda is the STH Company. Should I call them in?”


Alexander Kane leaned back in his chair, his gaze cold and calculating."No," he said after a pause, his tone sharp."Call in GLX instead."

Lilly Blake, seated nearby, glanced up at Alexander, startled by his abrupt decision. His expression revealed nothing of his thoughts, leaving her in the dark about what he was planning.

In a waiting room down the hall, Albert Lee and his team were caught off guard by the sudden summons. Confusion flickered across Albert's face.They had been told they were last on the schedule. Why the sudden change? Dismissing his unease, Albert gathered his team and strode confidently toward the meeting room.

As the heavy doors swung open, the atmosphere inside was instantly stifling. Albert scanned the room, his professional smile faltering as his eyes landed on Alexander Kane, seated at the head of the table with an air of undisputed authority. Beside him sat Lilly, posed and unreadable.

Albert's stomach churned. Seeing Lilly there was a shock. The last time they had spoken, she had been somneone entirely different-or so he had thought. Discovering her identity as the sole heir of the Blake empire through the media had left him reeling. If only he'd known the truth back then, he wouldn't have severed their ties so easily. Suppressing his emotions, Albert introduced himself and his company,outlining their eagerness to collaborate with Kane Corporation. His words flowed smoothly, but his confidence wavered under Alexander's piercing stare. When the presentation ended. Albert turned to Alexander for feedlback,only for the man to shift his gaze to Lilly. “What do you think?”Alexander asked, his tone deceptively calm.


Albert stiffened, his confusion deepening.Was Lilly the decision-maker here?


"In today's meeting," Alexander said, his voice cutting through the tension like a blade, "my wife will be evaluating and decidling on your project."

The words struck Albert like a blow.*Mywife.* The phrase echoed in his mind, leaving a bitter taste. He masked his discomfort,nodding respectfully.“Understood.”

Lilly's heart racedat Alexander's deliberate acknowledgment of her. Was this for Albert's benefit, or was there something deeper at play? She forced a polite smile, her gaze briefly meeting Albert's before shiftingto Alexander,whose icy stare sent shivers down her spine.

Maintaining her composure, Lilly addressed Albert.“Your presentation was well-prepared, and I've reviewed your project proposal. It's a commendable effort."

Albert's relief was short-lived as Lilly continued. “However, there's a critical issue that needs to be addressed.”

Albert leaned forward, his unease returning."What issue?" Lilly pointed to a section in the document. "Your cost and land calculations for the resort in the east are inaccurate. The proposed budget and space allocation are insufficient to meet the project's needs." Albert frowned, quickly reviewing the section. The errors were glaring.How had they missed this? "You're right," he admitted reluctantly.“What do you suggest?"

"Find a different location and revise your calculations." Lilly said evenly.

Albert hesitated. “Does this mean we'll have another chance to present?"

Before Lilly could respond, Alexander interjected, his tone frigid.“That won't be necessary."

The room fell silent, the weight of Alexander's words sinking in.

“Mr. Albert Lee.” Alexander said, his voice devoid of emotion,“Kane Corporation will not be partnering with your company. You have ten minutes to vacate the premises."

Albert's jaw tightened in disbelief.“But-”

Alexander stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor as he exited the room, leaving no room for negotiation. James, his assistant, followed in his wake.


Lilly hurried after them, her heels clicking against the polished floor.She caught up to James. “Where is he going?”

"His office," James replied, his expression unreadable.

Inside his office, Alexander issued swift orders.“Cancel the remaining meetings. Return their project plans and inform them we're not moving forward.”


James hesitated. “But sir, they're already-"


Alexander's glare silenced him."And one more thing. Ensure no company partners with GLX." James stared at him, stunned. Alexander wasn't just rejecting Albert; he was dismantling his business. Was this about Lilly's past with Albert?

"You're still here?" Alexander's sharp tone jolted James.

"Right away, sir." James said, retreating quickly.

In the hallway, he crossed paths with Lilly. "Is he inside?"she asked.

James nodded."Yes,ma'am."

Lilly stepped into the office, her expression stormy. Twenty minutes later.she emerged, her frustration palpable. She headed to the ground floor,her pace brisk.


As she reached the curb to hail a taxi, a sleek black car pulled up beside her. The tinted window rolled down,revealing a familiar face.

"Mr. Victor?"she asked, surprised.

"Your grandfather requests your presence." he said smoothly.

“For what reason?”

“You'll find out soon enough," Victor replied.


Lilly hesitated, glancing back at the towering building before clmbing into the car. Meanwhile, Alexander stood on the rooftop, the wind whipping around him. His eyes scanned the city below as his mind raced. Unable to find her,he checked the security footage, his expression darkening as he watched her leave in the black car. A storm of emotions surged within him. Memories long buried resurfaced, and a chilling thought crossed his mind. Was history repeating itself?
###Chapter 42

Alexander's office was a chaotic whirlwind of tasks, but his mind was elsewhere. The stack of files on his desk blurred into irrelevance as his thoughts circled around Lilly. Knowing that Caleb Blake's men had taken her didn't ease his anxiety. He could picture her grandfather's stern face,his words slicing through the airlike a blade. What was Caleb planning?Why had he summoned her so suddenly?

Unable to suppress the unease tightening in his chest, Alexander pushed back his chair and stood abruptly. He grabbed his jacket, ignoringthe blinking notification on his laptop about an upcoming critical meeting.

James entered just as Alexander was storming out, abundle of files clutched to his chest. "Boss, are you leaving?"

"Yes." Alexander snapped without breaking stride.

“But-there's an important meeting in an hour," James protested,his voice rising with panic. Alexander never canceled meetings, let alone one so crucial.


"Cancel it." His tone was sharp,final.

James gaped, frozen in shock."Huh?"

Alexander stopped, turning his steely gaze on James. "I said, *cancelit∗!His voice rose, laced with impatience. James swallowed hard and bowed slightly,"Y-yes,boss." Without another word, Alexander strode past him, his demeanor stormy.Watching him leave, James muttered to himself, "Miss Blake must be involved in this. She's the only one who can shake him like this." Despite his boss's foul mood, James couldn't help but feel a flicker of curiosity. Alexander Kane, the man known for his impenetrable composure.seemed to be unraveling.





Lilly sat stiffly in the backseat of a black car as it wove its way through remote roads. The urban skyline gradually gave way to a quiet. forested landscape.The car finally stopped in front of a secluded inn, its stone fac ade blending into the surroundings.


Victor, her grandfather's trusted aide, opened the door and gestured for her to step out. "This way, Miss Blake."


She followed him through the inn's dimly lit corridors, flanked by silent guards. They stopped in front of a heavy wooden door. Victor knocked once, then pushed it open, revealing a modest room. A tea set rested on a polished oak table, steam curling from a fresh pot. Seated at the head of the table was Caleb Blake, the patriarch of her family. Though in his seventies, his piercing gaze and commanding presence made him seem decades younger.


"Good day, Grandfather," Lilly greeted, bowing respectfully.

Caleb studied her for a moment before gesturing to the chair opposite him.“Sit. You shouldn't remain standing too long."

His cryptic comment made her pause. Did he know? Shaking off the thought,she complied, lowering herself into the seat.

"Have some tea," Caleb instructed, pouring her a cup, "Last time you refused to join me. This time, you won't.”

Lilly wrapped her hands around the delicate porcelain, taking a small sip."
Grandfather, you sent for me."

"Mmm," he nodded. his sharp eyes nartowing slightly. "Tell me.child.what's on your mind?"


His question caught her off guard. "Nothing, Grandfather. I was just thinking."


Caleb leaned forward, his gaze penetrating."Is there something you need to tell me?"


"No... There's nothin-"


The loud *bang* of Caleb's hand slamming against the table cut her off.Lilly flinched,her teacup trembling in her hands.


⋯∗Ncthing?!*”he thundered. "How about explaining why you're pregnant and didn't think to inform your grandfather?"

Lilly's heart stopped. Her hands froze mid-air, the teacup slipping from her fingers and clattering onto the table. "How... How did you-?"


Caleb's sharp laugh carried no warmth."You should know better than to underestimate me. Lilly.”


Shame washed over her as she lowered her gaze. Of course, he would know.Caleb Blake's network was legendary, his reach extending into places most could only dream of. "And that's not all." His voice was laced with fury now. "How dare you sign a contract with that man to have a child-and then leave the child with him? Have you lost your mind?" The room felt like it was closing in on her. Lilly dropped to her knees before him,her voice trembling. "Grandfather, please forgive me. I didn1't-,,


“Didn't *what*, Lilly? Didn't think I would find out?" Caleb's voice softened, but the disappointment in his tone cut her deeper than any yell.“I raised you to be strong, to value yourself. And yet, you willingly bound yourself to a devil like Alexander Kane?"


“Grandfather,he's not-”


"Don't you dare defend him," Caleb barked, his fist slamming down once more.“Do you even know who that man truly is? The things he's done?"


Lilly stared up at him, her lips parting to respond but no words coming out: What was he talking about? Her mind reeled with confusion.She loved Alexander despite his flaws. But now, staring at the anger etched into her grandfather's face, she wondered if there was something she didn't know.


“You think he's some tortured soul, don't you?” Caleb's voice dropped,almost to a whisper. "That he can be saved by love?" He leaned closer,his expression dark. “He's a man who destroys everything he touches.And you're willingly giving him my great-grandchild?”

Lilly's stomach churned.“Grandfather,please-”

“No!” Caleb interrupted, standing abruptly. His towering figure cast a shadow over her.“You will tell me everything now."
###Chapter 43

Lilly's mind swirled with unanswered questions. Her grandfather's cryptic warnings rang in her ears.there something I should know about Alexander?"* she had asked earlier, desperate for clarity. Caleb's pained expression hinted at the weight of a truth he was hesitant to reveal.

Before Caleb could respond, the door to the room swung open wwith force.Both Lilly and her grandfather turned to see Alexander stride in, his presence commanding as always. His sharp gaze immediately landed on Lilly, kneeling on the cold floor, her delicate frame visibly tense.

Alexander's frown deepened. He crossed the room in long,purposeful strides and pulled Lilly to her feet, his touch firm but not unkind. “Never kneel on the cold floor, especially not when you're carrying my child,"he said, his voice low yet authoritative.


Lilly instinctively pulled away from his grasp, her confusion mounting.Alexander's frown tightened as he caught her wrist again, refusing to let her retreat. Yet, her eyes remained fixed on her grandfather,seeking answers that seemed just out of reach.

"You scoundrel," Caleb spat, his voice dripping with disdain as he addressed Alexander. "Are you here to exploit my granddaughter further?" Lilly's chest tightened. She stood between two men who clearly knew more than they were letting on. Her grandfather's animosity toward Alexander,coupled with Alexander's unreadable demeanor, created a storm of tension that left her uneasy. Alexander, as usual, ignored Caleb's ire, his focus solely on Lilly. “I need to speak with your grandfather. Alone." His words were curt, leaving no room for debate. Lilly hesitated, glancing between them, but Alexander's expression softened just enough to prompt her to nod reluctantly.

As she stepped out of the room, her heart felt heavy. Outside,she found Victor and Max waiting by the cars. Both men greeted her respectfully,their presence a stark reminder of the dangerous world she had unknowingly stepped into.

"Max,open the car door for her," Alexander's voice carried through the open doorway, a subtle command that left no room for disobedience. Max moved swiftly to open Alexander's sleek black car, but Lilly shook her head and walked toward the car she had arrived in. Max, though puzzled,silently complied.

Inside the car, Lilly's thoughts raced. *Why did Grandfather call Alexander a devil? What is he hiding from me?* Her mind darted to the possibility of Alexander's underworld connections, something her grandfather had alluded


to in hushed warnings. She tried to dismiss the thought, but it clung to her like a shadow. If there was any truth to it, what had she gotten herself into?


Minutes stretched into an hour, and her impatience grew. Finally, she rolled down the window and called out to Victor, who stood a few paces away. "Uncle," she said softly, using the term of endearment she and her sisters had always called him.


Victor approached with a slight bow. "Yes, young miss?” "How long have they been talking?" "It's been over an hour now," he replied, glancing toward the inn. She frowned, her unease deepening, "Do you think something's wrong?"Victor hesitated, choosing his words carefully. "Discussions between them are rarely peaceful, but I wouldn't worry. Alexander... has his ways of handling things."


Lilly wasn't convinced."Did you bring anything to eat?" she asked,trying to change the subject and ease the knot in her stomach.


“I did, but I didn't think you'd want to eat in this situation," he admitted.
"Would you like me to bring you something?"

She shook her head. "No, I'll wait.”


Victor's concern lingered, but he nodded and returned to his post. As Lilly leaned back in her seat, the door to the inn opened. Alexander stormed out,his jaw set in anger, followed by Caleb, whose face was a mixture of frustration and resignation.

Victor sighed audibly. "As I said,it didn't end well."


Alexander scanned the area, his eyes narrowing when he didn't immediately spot Lilly in his car. "Where is she?" he snapped at Max.

Max gestured toward the other car.“Ma'am chose to wait in her car."

Alexander's irritation was palpable as he strode over to her, pulling the door open with sharp precision. “Let's go,"he said, his tone leaving no room for argument. Lilly hesitated, her own frustration rising,but she knew better than to defy him in front of everyone. He took her hand, his grip firm but not harsh, and led her to his car.Without a word, he helped her in, then followed, slamming the door shut behind him. “Drive," he commanded the driver, and the car sped off. Back at the inn, Caleb watched them leave, his expression conflicted. Victor approached him cautiously. "Master, did you come to an understanding?"

Caleb shook his head. "Not quite. But I've decided one thing-I won't be the one to tell her. She's smart; she'll figure it out. It's Alexander's responsibility now."

Victor frowned. "Do you trust him to protect her?"

Caleb sighed deeply. "I didn't, but today, I saw something in him. He may not realize it himself, but he cares for her. Perhaps more than he even understands."

Victor nodded, his own doubts somewhat eased."Then we can only hope she made the right choice."

As they got into their car anddrove away, a dark sedan parked discreetly nearby sprang to life. Inside, a man spoke into a phone. “They're on the move.”


“Good,"” came the cold voice on the other end."Continue to monitor her closely.”

“Yes, ma'am," the man replied before hanging up and driving off in the opposite direction.




In a luxurious penthouse, Bella set her phone down with a satisfied smirk.Beside her, Kate sipped her wine, her eyes gleaming with malice. "Did your men confirm they're keeping an eye on her?" Kate asked,her voice dripping with venom. "They're watching her every move,”Bella assured, her tone icy. "Lilly will no longer humiliate you-or stand in our way. Soon,she'll be gone for good."

Kate's lips curled into a wicked smile. "I can't wait to see her suffer."

Bella raised her glass. “Patience, my dear. Her downfall is already in motion.”


Their laughter echoed through the room. a chilling prelude to the storm brewing for Lilly.
###Chapter 44

The ride home was steeped in a tense silence. Lilly stared out the window.her mind a whirlwind of questions that gnawed at her resolve. Her grandfather's ominous words rang in her ears: *“You don't truly know him."* She stole glances at Alexander, his expression unreadable, his eyes fixed ahead as if the tension between them didn't exist.

When the car stopped in front of the estate, Lilly pushed the door open before the driver could reach her, stepping out into the cool night air.She didn't wait for Alexander and headed straight for the house, her heels clicking sharply against the marble steps. Behind her, she heard his measured footsteps quicken, and before she could ascend the grand staircase,he caught her wrist.


"Stop," he said, his voice low and firm.

She turned to face him, her expression challenging.“What now?”

Clara appeared at the doorway, her usual warm greeting stilled by the palpable tension. She gave a quick nod and retreated with the other maids,their whispers trailing behind them.


Alexander's gaze was unrelenting.“Do you have something to ask me?"

Lilly hesitated, but the weight of her unanswered questions tipped her resolve.“Yes. Why did my grandfather sa y I don't truly know you? WVhat haven't you told me?" His lips pressed into a thin line before he spoke. "Follow me." Her stomach churned at his tone. He led her to the elevator, the air around them thick with unspoken truths. Lilly's brow furrowed as he pressed a 
button she hadn't noticed before-one marked only with a small symbol.


“There's an underground floor?" she asked.

"You'll see," was all he said.


The elevator descended, the hum of machinery filling the oppressive silence.When the doors slid open, the darkness beyond was almost suffocating.


“It's pitch black," she murmured, taking an uneasy step forward.

"Lights on," Alexander commanded, his voice cutting through the void.

The basement was suddenly awash in bright, sterile light. Lilly's breath hitched as she took in the sight before her: a pristine white corridor leading to a glass door.


"What's behind that door?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.


“You'll find out soon enough." His tone was calm, but the edge in it sent a shiver down her spine.


He placed his hand on the biometric scanner, and the door unlocked with a soft click. As it swung open, the lights inside flickered on, revealing an arsenal that made Lilly's blood run cold. A shooting range stretched out before her, its walls lined with glass cases displaying an array of weapons,from sleek pistols to intimidating rifles. Her voice wavered as she asked, "Why do you have this here?" Alexander's response was unsettling in its simplicity. "To clear my head." She stepped inside cautiously, the cold tile beneath her feet amplifying the chill creeping up her spine. Her eyes roamed over the guns,her mind flashing back to the few shooting lessons she'd taken for sport. But this was different. This was calculated. Dangerous.


Turning to face him, she asked the question that had been building in her mind since their conversation with her grandfather. "Are you involved in the underworld?”


Alexander's gaze darkened, his eyes locking onto hers with an intensity that made her want to retreat. Instead, she stood her ground, even as his silence became deafening.


"Yes," he finally admitted, the word hanging in the air like a thunderclap.

Lilly's breath caught. She had suspected as much, but hearing him confirm it was a different matter entirely. Her grandfather's warnings about the devil in disguise echoed in her mind. Yet, here he was, openly admitting the truth-a truth that could shatter everything she thought she knew about him.


"Why are you telling me this now?" she asked, her voice trembling.


“Because you deserve to know what you've signed up for,"he said,his tone unreadable. "And because I don't hide from the people I care about."


The admission took her by surprise. Was this his way of saying he cared for her? Or was it a calculated move to earn her trust? Lilly couldn't tell.


The weight of it all became too much. She tuarned to leave, needing space to process what she'd just learned, But Alexander's hand shot out,grabbing her wrist. "Where are you going?"

“To clear my head," she said, echoing his earlier words. He studied her for a moment before letting her go. “Don't leave the house,”
he said firmly.

"I won't," she assured him. "I'll be in my room."

For the next five days, they barely spoke. Lilly avoided their shared meals,timing her routines to avoid crossing paths with him. But Alexander noticed. He always noticed.


One evening, after her bath, she emerged to find him sitting on her bed.his phone in hand. Startled, she froze, clutching the towel wrapped around her body. His eyes lifted to meet hers, sweeping over her in a way that sent heat rushing to her cheeks.


Embarrassed, she grabbed her clothes and retreated back into the bathroom,her heart pounding. *What is he doing in my room?* she wondered.His gaze lingered in her mind, a mix of something unreadable but undeniably intense.


When she finally stepped out, dressed and composed,he stood,closing the distance between them. "Where are you going?"he asked, his voice low.


"To meet my grandfather," she replied, hoping he wouldn't press further.

“And your antenatal appointment?" he asked, surprising her. “It's today,isn't it?”


“Yes, I'm going," she said, thrown by his attention to detail.

He nodded but didn't move. “Are you avoiding me?” “What?”she stammered. “You've been avoiding me for five days," he said, his voice tinged with frustration. "That stops now. From today, you'll have breakfast and dinner with me. No more excuses."

Lilly blinked, caught off guard by his sudden demand. But beneathn his stern words,she saw something else-something that looked almost like longing. Her heart softened despite herself.

"Fine," she said quietly. “But I'm not avoiding you out of dislike. I just needed time to process...everything."

Alexander's eyes softened for a moment before he stepped closer,his hand brushing her waist. "You signed up for this, Lilly. You don't get to walk away just because it's difficult."


She looked up at him, her heart pounding. “I'm not walking away," she whispered."I just need you to meet me halfway."


His eyes flicked to herlips, and before she could say another word, he kissed her-deep, possessive, and unapologetic. In that moment, all the doubts, fears, and questions faded into the background.
###Chapter 45

The kiss lingered in Lilly's thoughts, a heady mix of surprise and confusion. When they finally broke apart, her breath hitched, her cheeks a deep crimson. Alexander's piercing gaze locked onto hers, unreadable yet intense, as though he was unraveling her every thought. The room felt too small, the air thick with unspoken words.

He finally broke the silence. "I've arranged for a driver and a bodyguard to accompany you from now on," his voice steady,yet holding an edge of command.


Her brow furrowed. "A new driver?"

"Yes. You won't be leaving or returning alone anymore. Your safety is non-negotiable."


She nodded slowly, unsure whether to feel reassured or alarmed.

"When you're done with your errands, head to the family residence tonight."he added.


Her heart skipped. "The family residence? Is Grandma okay?" Concern laced her voice; Alexander rarely mentioned family unless it was significant.


He tilted his head, his expression softening just enough to stir unease. "Sandra arrives this afternoon. Grandma's hosting a welcome party for her.She expects you there." "Will you be there?" she ventured cautiously, her voice almost a whisper. His lips curved slightly, the ghost of a smirk.'′′Dyou want me there?" Caught off guard, she hesitated before retorting, "Isn't she your sister?Shouldn't yoube welcoming her home?"

"Mmm," he hummed, his fingers finally releasing her waist.She hadn't even noticed how firmly he'd been holding her until his absence left her cold. The sudden space between them felt unbearable.

Alexander leaned in, brushing his hand through her hair,his fingers twisting a strand before letting it fall. His eyes held a promise, or perhaps a warning. "Be good," he murmured before turning and walking away,leaving her standing there, her heart racing.

Lilly pressed her palm to her chest, then her lips, the memory of his touch still warm. It wasn't their first kiss, but it felt unlike any before-raw,purposeful, and completely disarming.




Descending the grand staircase, Lilly noticed a sleek black car parked at the entrance. Two men stood by it, both unfamiliar. The bodyguard opened the door with a precise, almost militaristic bow.

"Good morning, ma'am. I'm Pedro, your new bodyguard," he said, his voice deep and clipped. He was tall, dark, and imposing-an unmistakable air of authority about him. She nodded, her gaze shifting to the driver, who introduced himself as Samuel. His build was equally intimidating. Alexander wasn't taking chances,it seemed. "To the hospital," she instructed. "Yes, ma'am," Samuel replied as Pedro took the front passenger seat,his eyes scanning their surroundings with hawk-like precision. At the hospital, Lilly knocked lightly on Dr. Sophia's door before stepping inside. The doctor greeted her warmly, her face lighting up.

"Good morning, Mrs. Kane," Sophia teased, the title making Lilly's cheeks flush.


"You look radiant today," Sophia noted, her observant eyes narrowing. "Wait-what's this glow? Spill it."

Lilly hesitated, recalling the way Alexander's kiss had left her breathless."I'll tell you when I'm sure," she hedged.

"Sure about what?" Sophia pressed, her curiosity piqued.

"About Alexander," Lilly admitted quietly, a faint smile betraying her thoughts.

Sophia's eyes widened, practically dragging Lilly to the couch."He did something, didn't he?"


Lilly sighed, nodding. "He kissed me this morning," she confessed,her voice barely above a whisper.

Sophia gasped, clasping Lilly's hands. "Finally! What did you do?"

"I told him my feelings hadn't changed," Lilly said, the memory of his response sending a shiver down her spine. Sophia beamed. "And this is Alexander we're talking about? The same man who avoids emotions like the plague? Oh, Lilly, this is huge!" Lilly's heart warmed at her friend's enthusiasm but tempered her excitement. "He also ordered me to eat with him every day," she said, unsure whether to view it as affection or control.

"For him, that's practically romantie." Sophia quipped.




By early afternoon, Lilly found herself standing in front of Blake Headquarters. The towering building loomed over her, a stark reminder of her family's legacy. As she stepped inside, employees and directors scrambled to greet her, their deference almost suffocating.

"Miss Blake, welcome," one of the directors said, bowing.

Lilly responded with a curt nod, allowing them to escort her to the 20th-floor meeting room. Her grandfather's presence dominated the room,seated at the head of the table. Beside him sat her father, his expression a calculated mix of authority and pride.

"Grandfather," she greeted respectfully before turning to her father with a professional nod.


Her eyes swept the room, landing on Kate at the far end. Her half-sister's frown was as sharp as a dagger. Ignoring Kate's obvious discontent. Lilly took her seat beside her grandfather, her posture regal yet unyielding.

"Let's begin," she said, her voice steady, carrying the weight  of someone who knew her place in the family hierarchy. But beneath the surface, tension simmered. In a family like theirs, every meeting was a battlefield, every move calculated. Lilly braced herself,knowing that this was only the beginning.
###Chapter 46

"This initiative will not succeed," Lilly declared, her voice cold and sharp as she uncapped a red pen. With a single, deliberate stroke,she scrawled the word FAIL across the cover of the project document. The sound of the folder hitting the table echoed through the boardIroom,leaving an uncomfortable silence in itswake.


The tension was palpable. Every pair of eyes darted toward her, disbelief etched on their faces.


Peter Blake leaned forward, his gaze narrowing at his daughter. "I already sanctioned that project. On what grounds do you believe it will fail?" His voice was calm, but there was an undercurrent of irritation. This wasn't what he had expected when he insisted she oversee the project sign-off.

Lilly met his eyes with an unwavering stare, her demeanor exuding authority far beyond her years. "Do you want my honest assessment,or are we here to rubber-stamp failures?"

Peter flinched slightly, caught off guard by her boldness. Around the room.whispers began to ripple as the directors exchanged uneasy glances. Kate,standing off to the side, clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms.The disrespect! Did Lilly even comprehend the months of effort their father had poured into this? "How dare you dismiss a project without proper justification?" one of the senior directors challenged, his voice trembling with barely concealed indignation. Lilly turned to him, her expression unreadable. "Let me ask you this-did you personally inspect the rural area where you plan to build, or did you rely on a glossy pitch deck and online research?" The director's face flushed as he stammered, "The team-uh, they assured me一


"Exactly as I thought," Lilly cut him off, her voice icy. "You approved a multimillion-dollar project based on assumptions."


She turned back to Peter, her voice dropping into a tone laced with disappointment. "Mr. Blake, as the president, isn't it your responsibility to scrutinize proposals? Or have you delegated that duty entirely to complacency?"


The room fell silent as the weight of her words sank in. Peter's jaw tightened, a flicker of hurt crossing his face. She had called him*Mr.Blake,* not *father.* Not since... the incident.

"How can you be so sure the project will fail?" Peter demanded, his voice low but strained. "You haven't even visited the site yourself."

Lilly exhaled slowly, her patience wearing thin. "Because I *did* my research," she said, her tone laced with quiet defiance. "If you send a team for a proper inspection, they'll find what I already know-this land is a disaster waiting to happen. Frequent natural calamities. Unstable terrain.Build a resort there, and you're not just wasting money. You're inviting ruin."


A wave of murmurs spread through the room. Kate looked like she was ready to explode, but even she couldn't deny the doubt creeping into her mind.

 Peter, however, was silent, his gaze fixed on his daughter. Could she be right? She had always been sharp,but this? Lilly didn't wait for further questions. "I suggest you verify my findings before proceeding. Until then, consider this project dead." With that,she gathered her papers and strode out, her heels clieking against the marble floor like a gavel delivering judgment.

As the doors closed behind her. Peter's father-who had been silently observing-allowed a small, approving smile to curve his lips. She's ready.*he thought.




Lilly walked briskly down the hall, her mind swirling with unspoken emotions. She barely noticed her father's voice calling after her until his hand caught her arm.


"Lilly," Peter began, his tone softer now.


She turned slowly, her expression guarded. "Is this about the project? I've said all I needed to say."

"No," Peter replied, shaking his head. "It's about u1s."

Her jaw tightened. "What about us?"

"I... I want to fix this," he said, his voice tinged with desperation. "I want us to go back to the way things were. Before... everything." His words faltered, his eyes searching hers for any sign of warmth. Lilly's lips curled into a bitter smile. "Go back? To what? To when you broke our hearts by remarrying so quickly after Mom died? Or to when you prioritized Brenda over your own daughters? Tell me, *Mr. Blake,*which part of the past are you so desperate to return to?" Peter flinched as if struck. "Lilly, please. I know I made mistakes,but-" "But nothing," she interrupted, her voice trembling with suppressed anger."You want to fix things? Start by finding the people who killed my sisters."Her voice cracked, betraying the depth of her pain.

"Lilly,I-"

"Don't," she snapped, stepping back. "You can't undo what's been done.And you can't make me forget."


With that, she turned and walked away, her steps heavy with emotion.Peter stood frozen, his heart aching as he watched her retreating figure.





By the time Lilly arrived at the family residence, exhaustion had settled over her. The glowing "Welcome Back Home" banner hanging over the entrance felt almost mocking.


"Welcome, ma'am," Camila greeted, bowwing slightly.

"Good evening, Camila," Lilly replied with a faint smile, her eyes scanning the bustling house.

"She's here early," Grandma Helen's voice rang out as she descended the stairs.


Lilly hurried to her, offering her arm for support. "I missed you, Grandma."And I missed you too," Helen said warmly. But her sharp eyes quickly noticed the redness in Lilly's eyes. "Have you been crying?" ′′NO,Grandma," Lilly lied smoothly. "Just something in my eye." Helen's gaze lingered, but she chose not to press. Instead,she smiled."Go rest in Alexander's room. You've had a long day. I'll have Camila fetch you when everyone arrives."

As Lilly retreated upstairs,her mind churned with thoughts of the evening ahead.She knew the night would bring questions,challenges,and perhaps revelations she wasn't ready to face. By 7:30 pm, the house was alive with chatter. Sandra's friends,family acquaintances, and key figures had all gathered, their laughter filling the air.


Lilly joined them, her face composed as she greeted the guests. Yet, amidst the pleasantries, a nagging tension lingered, like a storm cloud waiting to burst.


"Where's Alexander?" Sophia asked, her tone light but pointed.

"Busy with work, perhaps," Lilly replied evenly, though she wasn't sure herself.


Outside, a sleek car pulled up to the mansion. A young woman stepped out, her dark hair catching the fading light. Her eyes sparkled with childlike excitement as she gazed at the grand estate.


"Home sweet home," she murmured, her lips curling into a smile that hinted at secrets untold.
###Chapter 47

“Surprise!!"

The moment Sandra stepped through the door, a chorus of voices erupted in a warm, boisterous greeting. She froze in place for a heartbeat, her eyes wide as she took in the sight. A roomn filled with friends, family, and familiar faces greeted her, the cheerful noise mingling with laughter and excitement.


“Oh my..." Sandra's smile spread, her heart leaping in her chest. It had been so long since she felt this kind of warmth. Her eyes scanned the crowd,catching sight of her high school friends and a few family friends she hadn't seen in ages.


"Welcome back, my granddaughter," Grandma Helen said with open arms.her voice brimming with joy.

"Grandma," Sandra said immediately, rushing into her embrace."I missed you.”


"I missed you too," Helen replied emotionally, holding her close as tears welled in her eyes.


Lilly, standing off to the side, watched the reunion silently, her smile small but genuine as Sandra hugged one friend after another. Sandra's laughter filled the room as she made her way through the crowd, greeting familiar faces until she approached Richard.  “Richard!" Sandra exclaimed, her voice warm and familiar. “Sandra!" Richard responded just as enthusiastically. They embraced, their hug tight and full of the kind of affection only old
 friends could share. But as they broke apart. Sandra's gaze shifted to Lilly,who stood a few paces away, observing the reunion with a polite.composed smile.

"Welcome home, Sandra," Lilly said, her voice soft, yet undeniably warm.

All eyes in the room shifted toward Sandra as she stood still for a moment.contemplating. Everyone was waiting. Even Grandma Helen, who stood at the edge of the room, was eagerly watching to see how Sandra would react to Lilly.


After what felt like an eternity, Sandra smiled-an unexpectedly bright,welcoming smile. She stepped forward, wrapping Lilly in an embrace that startled everyone, including Lilly. No one had expected such a gesture on their first meeting, least of all Lilly.

For a moment, the room was completely still, the tension in the air dissipating as Sandra pulled back from the hug and flashed a teasing grin.“I never thought my cold-hearted brother had such a good eye for beauty,"she commented, her voice playful yet laced with an edge.


Lilly smiled, her lips curling in response.“You're stunning," Sandra added,her words genuine.

“Thank you, and so are you," Lilly replied, her voice steady, though there was an underlying hesitation.Grandma Helen let out a sigh of relief, the tension in her shoulders melting as she watched Sandra and Lilly engage in a conversation. It was clear to everyone that, for the momenat, Sandra had accepted Lilly. Sandra leaned in closer to Lilly. "So, tell me more about you and Alexander," she asked, her curiosity piqued as they continued to talk. As their conversation deepened. Sandra was delighted to learn that she would soon be an aunt. Her excitement was palpable. "That's the greatest gift Alexander could give me" she said with a broad smile.

By then. Sandra's thoughts turned to the only other petson she truly wanted to see."By the way, where is Alexander?" she asked.

Lilly's smile faltered, but she quickly recovered."He'll be here soon." she said,though the uncertainty in her voice didn't go unnoticed.

The room fell into a lighter chatter as everyone continued to enjoy dinner.Just as they were beginning to settle in, the door opened. and Alexander stepped inside. His presence was commanding.his eyes scanning the room before they landed on his sister.


"Brother!" Sandra stood up quickly, her voice filled with warmth and affection.


Alexander walked toward her. his expression a mix of fondness and calm control. As soon as they embraced, the room seemed to quiet. Lilly watched.noting the brief but genuine warmth in Alexander's eyes as he hugged Sandra. Despite his usual stoic demeanor, it was clear he cared deeply for his family.


After a moment, Sandra let go of her brother and took a seat, leaving Alexander to settle next to Lilly. There was a brief silence before Lilly spoke, her voice a bit softer now.

"I'm glad you made it," she said. Alexander nodded, his gaze lingering on her face for a moment longer than usual. "Is something on my face?" Lilly asked, raising an eyebrow. "No,” he replied slowly, though his gaze didn't waver, "Did you cry?" Lilly blinked, confused. "Huh? No," she said, her voice carrying a hint of uncertainty."Why do you ask?"

Alexander said nothing, but his eyes never left her. He knew more than he let on-his bodyguards had reported everything about her recent activities.including the fact that she'd cried after speaking with her father earlier that day.

The evening passed in relative ease, with laughter and shared stories around the dinner table. However, as the night wore on, Lilly's mind was elsewhere. Her phone buzzed in her pocket, and she quickly excused herself from the room. It was a message from Matthew.

We've found him. Call me.

Lilly's heart skipped a beat as she read the text. She rushed outside to make the call.


\---

"Where is he?" Lilly demanded, her voice urgent as she paced the hallway.

"If we're right, he's hiding in a small village in the western part of the country,"Matthew's voice crackled through the phone.

"That's not too far. How long will it take to get there?" Lilly asked,her mind already racing through the logistics of the journey.
 "The village is near City U. We'l need to get to the city, take a train to a nearby town, and then drive from there," Matthew explained.
Lilly cursed under her breath. "He's done well to hide, but we've found him. Now we need to catch him." 
"Yes," Matthew agreed."We'll make him confess to his crimes and tell us who sent him."

Lilly felt the weight of the situation pressing down on her. But there's more,"she thought. Sarah's warning echoed in her mind:

*"You need to tell Alexander. He trusts you now."*

Lilly hesitated, but Sarah's voice was firm in her head. *If you keep this from him, you'll lose that trust.*

"I think it's time you tell Alexander," Sarah had said earlier.“You can't keep hiding this. He has connections that could get the assassin to talk.”

Lilly stood still for a moment, lost in thought. Then Michael added, “Sarah's right. Your stepmother-now that you're the vice president-she's definitely planning something. You can't face this alone."

Lilly nodded,though doubt lingered in her mind. She needed Alexander's help,but telling him felt like walking a dangerous line.




When she returned home later that evening, she found Alexander already there.Clara greeted him warmly, but Sandra's usual welcome was absent.He looked around, noticing Lilly's absence. "Ma'am is already back home," Clara commented, watching Alexander closely. Without a word, he walked up the stairs, his mind racing. When he knocked on Lilly's door, there was no response. He opened the door and found it empty. His steps quickened as he made his way to the mini-library on the ground floor,where he found Lilly reading,her back to the door.

Lilly turned when she heard the door open, and when her eyes met Alexander's, her breath caught in her throat. She stood up immediately.moving toward him and embracing him without hesitation.

"What are you doing here?" he asked, his voice low,laced with curiosity.

“Waiting for you," she replied, her words steady but carrying an undertone of something heavier.


"In here? That's new." Alexander's lips quirked into a small, amused smile.


"I need to tell you something important," Lilly said, her tone suddenly serious.


Alexander's expression shifted, and he gestured for her to sit."What is it?"

Lilly hesitated, but then she stepped back and looked him in the eyes,her face somber. "It's about my sisters'deaths."

Alexander frowned, his attention fully on her. "You said you were investigating but found nothing."

"I did find somnething," Lilly corrected softly. "I know who killed them."
 
Alexander's brow furrowed, "You do?” "Yes,” Lilly replied, her voicetrembling with the weight of the revelation. “Who? And how long have you known?” Alexander pressed, his concern deepening.
"My stepmother and Kate," Lilly whispered. her throat tightwith emotion.


A heavy silence filled the room as Alexander processed her words.He turned away, his fists clenching.

"How long?" he asked again, his voice rough with anger.

"Two months after I went into hiding," Lilly replied, her voice breaking.

"And you've kept it to yourself? Letting the murderers walk free all this time?" Alexander's voice raised with fury, his control slipping for a moment.

Lilly swallowed,her heart pounding in her chest. “There wasn't enough evidence. I couldn't risk going to anyone without solid proof.”

"Solid proof? You should have told me, told your grandfather,"he snapped.unable to contain his anger. “You've been putting yourself at risk while they roam free!"

Lilly's breath hitched as tears filled her eyes. But despite the fury in his words, Alexander saw the pain in her eyes, and it softened him. He crossed the room and wiped the tear that slipped down her cheek.

"Stop crying," he muttered,pulling her into his arms.

Lilly leaned into him, finding solace in his warmth despite the storm that raged within her. "Tell me what you need me to do," Alexander said, his voice calm now but carrying a dangerous promise. Lilly pulled away slightly, her eyes locking with his. "I need your help to make the killer confess," Alexander's gaze turned cold, his jaw tightening. "Then we'll make them pay.”
###Chapter 48

Over the past month, everything between them had changed. Alexander.though never expressing his affection verbally, had showvn her in countless ways how deeply he cared. His actions spoke louder than words ever could,and Lilly had finally started to feel it. The last two months had been a whirlwind of unexpected turns-first. Alexander was undeniably falling for her;second, she had risen to the vice president of the Blake empire;third,she was carrying their child; and fourth, she had developed a strong relationship with his grandmother and sister. But despite everything that seemed to be falling into place, Lilly knew that true happiness would remain just out of reach until she avenged her sisters' deaths.

"I know where the one who killed them is hiding," Lilly said, her voice low,barely a whisper.

Alexander stiffened.“Where?"

“A small village in the west."

"I won't let you get involved," he said, his tone sharp."This is my responsibility. I'll make sure the truth comes out. You just focus on yourself and our baby."

“No,”she replied, hervoice unwavering. "I need to be there when you confront him. I want to witness his confession." He eyed her intensely, his expression unreadable. “You're sure? You really want to be there?" “Yes. I have to be." His eyes darkened, the tension between them growing heavier. "Are you asking me to go all the way? To make them suffer completely?"

Lilly shook her head. "No. I don't want you to make it easy for them.I want them to pay. I want the world to know they're responsible and to be locked away,facing the consequences."

A brief flicker of something almost like admiration crossed Alexander's face,but it was gone before Lilly could fully recognize it. “Yoú think I plan to give them an easy way out?”His voice was cold, filled with a promise."I will make them face the full weight of their actions. You don't need to worry about that."

Lilly's heart raced, but she held her ground. "Then I want to be there when you get the truth. I want to see it for myself.”

Alexander's gaze hardened.“No.”

The single word struck her like a slap. She stared at him, refusing to back down. "Please, Alexander. I need this. I need to be there for them. They took my sisters from me.”

“I said no," he repeated, his voice much firmer now. “The last thing I want is for you to witness what's coming. It's not a world I want you exposed to."

Lilly's breath caught, her chest tightening. She stepped closer, desperation creeping into her voice. "You don't understand. I need to be there. I can't be left out of this." Alexander's expression remained rigid, but his eyes betrayed a flicker of conflict. Still, he stood firm. "When I say no, I mean it.” She knew he wouldn't budge, but the fire in her rose, unyielding. She followed him as he turned to leave, his footsteps echoing in the quiet of the room. Without thinking, she stepped into the elevator with him, not letting him out of her sight.

"You're not changing my mind," he said, his voice low.

"I'm not trying to," she replied, her eyes focused on him as she unbuttoned his suit jacket. Slowly, she removed his shirt, her fingers grazing his chest. The touch was intimate, electric, and she could feel his resolve weakening just as much as hers.


Alexander's breath hitched, his body reacting to her touch in an instant.Before either of them knew it, they were on the bed, wrapped in each other,the world outside forgotten.


"I don't want you going back to your room," he muttered between kisses.“Clara will move your things to mine."


Her heart swelled at his words, and she smiled softly. “How long have I waited for you to say that?"


He smirked, that rare, charming smile creeping onto his lips. "Since the day I kicked you out of it, I'm guessing?”

Lilly's heart fluttered, but her thoughts were quickly lost in the heat of the moment. Their passion took over, but even then, a part of her remained determined, knowing that she couldn't let go of her need for justice. Hours later, Alexander held her in his arms, his gaze soft as she drifted into sleep. He kissed her forehead tenderly, but his mind was far from peaceful. He couldn't keep her safe from the storm that was coming, no matter how much he tried to shield her. The morning light crept in through the curtains, and before she had fully opened her eyes, he was already pulling her back into the storm.Their connection was undeniable, his every touch a promise, each kiss a reaffirmation of his desire.

As Lilly examined her body in the mirror, she couldn't help but gasp. The hickeys scattered across her neck, chest, and thighs were vivid marks of possession. She smiled faintly, touching them gently, before realizing how much she had to cover up. She placed a hand on her stomach, still flat at four months along, but a small smile tugged at her lips. She was carrying their child, and the thought of it was enough to push away her fear,for a moment at least.

Lilly chose a stylish black outfit to hide the marks-tight pants, a silky white shirt, and a cream coat to cover the rest. Thankfully, the cold weather made it all seem more natural. No one would question her choice of clothing. Not that she cared what anyone thought.


At the Blake empire headquarters, things were starting to feel more familiar. It had been a month since she assumed the vice presidency, and her role was only growing. Relationships with the staff were stronger,and the company's stock had risen sharply. Her name was now synonymous with success and power.


But when she stepped off the elevator, the last thing she expected was to see Kate standing outside her office.


"What are you doing here?” Lilly asked, her voice taut with suspicion. Kate turned, her smile forced, but still dangerous. “Dearest sister," she greeted in a sickly sweet tone.Lilly couldn't help but notice the way Kate's eyes lingered on her neck. A flash of anger passed through her stepsister's gaze before she covered it with a practiced smile. Lilly's heart skipped a beat. She knew exactly what Kate was thinking.

“You still haven't answered my question," Lilly pressed, keeping her voice calm, despite the rising tension in her chest.

“Oh, I'm just admiring how happy you look," Kate said, her voice taking on a mocking lilt. “But tell me, how long do you think that happiness will last?”


"Forever," Lilly responded, her voice steely,refusing to show weakness.

Kate's laughter was cold,devoid of warmth. "You've taken everything from me, everything I ever wanted. But it's okay,"she said, her voice dripping with venom. "What are sisters for,right?”

Lilly stood tall, her eyes narrowing. “Leave.”

Kate raised her hands in mock defeat. “Okay, okay, I'll leave." She turned toward the elevator, but as the doors opened, her smile faded.She looked back at Lilly, her eyes filled with malice. "Today is your last day on earth.Lilly.”


The doors closed with a soft hiss, and Lilly felt her blood run cold. Kate's words hung in the air, a chilling warning.
###Chapter 49

After Kate left. Lilly couldn't shake the feeling that her stepsister's visit was more than a mere coincidence. There was an underlying tension in the air, a sense of something dark looming just out of reach. Lilly's mind raced,replaying their conversation over and over. Kate's words felt like a slow-burning fuse, and Lilly was certain that her stepsister wasn't finished with her yet.

Her frustration boiled over as she walked back to her office. Every day,she lived with the same burning anger-the anger of knowing that the people responsible for her sisters' deaths were still out there, living freely without consequence. She had already provided Alexander with every shred of evidence,including the location of the assassin who had orchestrated the whole thing. It was only a matter of time before Kate and her mother's entire web of deceit would unravel. But until that happened, Lilly couldn't relax. Not yet. Not until she saw true justice for her sisters.


That morning, Alexander had taken further precautions, ramping up security at the estate, making sure Lilly would be protected at all costs.She appreciated his concern but couldn't shake the feeling that something more was brewing. Something bigger than just her sisters' killers.

As the day drew to a close, Lilly headed to her lunch date with Sandra.Her bond with Alexander's sister had deepened over the past few weeks,and it was one of the few things that managed to keep her grounded amidst the chaos of her life. "Sister-in-law!" Sandra greeted her with a warm hug as Lilly stepped out of the car. Lilly chuckled, hugging her back. "You've been waiting long?" Sandra grinned. "For two hours!"

Lilly raised an eyebrow, eyes wide with surprise. "Really?”

Sandra's face broke into a mischievous smile. "Kidding! Only about fifteen minutes."


Lilly sighed in relief, then playfully swatted Sandra's arm.


"Come on, let's go eat," Sandra linked her arm with Lilly's. "And after, we're going shopping... and maybe a movie?"


"Shopping again?" Lilly asked, incredulous. They had just gone a fewdays ago.


Sandra grinned. "You know I can't resist. And it's not like my brother's complaining."


Lilly's mind flickered back to the last shopping spree, when Alexander had blocked Sandra's cards after she'd maxed out the limit. It had been a whole week of no spending for Sandra, a punishment that Lilly had wholeheartedly supported. Now, Sandra was trying to convince her to join in on another spree.

"You're planning on spending my money again, aren't you?" Lilly said,knowing where this was headed.
 Sandra pouted but then flashed a bright smile. "Let's use your card this time. I'll be good, I promise!" Lilly sighed. "You never change, do you?" Sandra's eyes glinted mischievously. "I will, after this shopping trip.I swear." Lilly hesitated for a moment, then gave in. "Fine, but only because you promised."


"Yay!" Sandra cheered, dragging her toward the restaurant. The meal was delicious, and the shopping trip that followed had Sandra's excitement off the charts. Every store was filled with things Lilly didn't need, but Sandra had a way of convincing her that they did.

After hours of shopping, they finally made their way to a baby clothing store. Sandra was already picking out baby outfits for both genders, even though Lilly's pregnancy was only four months along. It was still a touch too early to tell the baby's gender, but Sandra's excitement was infectious.

Finally, they made their way to a jewelry store, where Sandra picked out an extravagant set of matching dresses. The last thing Lilly wanted was more jewelry or clothes, but Sandra insisted on them trying on the matching outfits.

"Come on, sister-in-law, please," Sandra begged, showing Lilly the white skirt,blouse, and jacket combination.

Lilly hesitated, eyeing the elegant outfit. "It's beautiful, but...”

"Just once!" Sandra urged.

Lilly's resolve crumbled under Sandra's pleading gaze. "Fine. Just this once." Sandra grinned, thrilled, and pulled her into the dressing room. They emerged, both wearing the matching outfits, their hair styled similarly.They laughed at how alike they looked. "We look like twins," Sandra exclaimed as they stared at their reflections. Lilly laughed, but a part of her felt unsettled. It had been a day of indulgence, but something was off. She couldn't shake the feeling that something dark was closing in.

By the time they finished their shopping, the sun was starting to set.Sandra insisted they walk to the nearby park, but Lilly was reluctant.

"It's getting late," she said, her unease growing as they neared the park.
There were far too many people around for her liking.

Sandra, however, wasn't hearing it. "Just a quick walk. I want ice cream."

Lilly rolled her eyes but agreed, albeit reluctantly. “Fine. But we're going home after that."


As they approached the ice cream stand, Lilly felt her anxiety spike. The crowd in the park seemed too dense, the air too thick with tension. Her eyes darted around, looking for any sign of trouble.

Two cars parked nearby, their engines running quietly. The hairs on the back of Lilly's neck stood up. Something wasn't right.

One of the men in the passenger seat of the car spoke into a phone.“Target in sight."

Lilly didn't hear the rest of the conversation, but the words “Finish it”echoed ominously in her mind. She turned to Sandra, about to say something, when the roar of an engine tore through the air. A car sped toward them at terrifying speed. Before Lilly could react, there was a deafening∗bang∗−ashot rang out, followed by the sound of screeching tires and panicked screams from the bystanders.


Lilly's heart stopped as she turned toward the horrific sight unfolding before her. Sandra's body crumpled to the ground, lifeless, blood pooling around her.


Time seemed to freeze. Lilly screamed, her voice drowned out by the chaos.as the lifeless body of her sister-in-law lay before her.

Everything around her blurred, and her mind was consumed by one thought-revenge.
###Chapter 50

Lilly's heart pounded as the car hurtled towards the ice cream stand. She barely had time to process what was happening before the screech of tires filled the air, and she saw Sandra's figure knocked violently to the ground."Sandra!! No!l" Lilly screamed, her voice breaking as she rushed to her sister-in-law's side, her hands trembling.


The scene was chaotic-blood pooled on the pavement. staining the
ground red as Lilly cradled Sandra's limp body in her arms. "Sandra.please... please stay with me," she begged, her voice barely above a whisper.The weight of the moment crushed her, her hands trembling as they soaked in Sandra's blood. She had been through this kind of pain before-the kind that made her feel powerless and small. The memory of her sisters' deaths loomed over her like a dark cloud. She couldn't lose Sandra
too.

The bodyguards had already begun chasing the fleeing vehicle, but Lilly was frozen in place. "Stay with me, Sandra, don't close your eyes," Lilly sobbed, pressing her forehead to Sandra's, her tears mixing with the blood on her face. Her mind raced,memories of that tragic day when she lost her sisters flashing before her eyes. It felt as though the world was closing in on her, and once again,she was helpless in the face of danger.

"Sandra.,, please..." The words escaped her lips in a desperate whisper.The pain was too much to bear, and yet, the chilling silence of the crowd-standing frozen, watching-only amplified her anguish. She had to stay strong. For Sandra. For the baby. But everything felt like it was slipping through her fingers.

The minutes dragged on, an eternity of fear, before Pedro and Samuel finally managed to call for an ambulance. Lilly's hands,now soaked in blood, trembled as she gazed at the dark crimson stain spreading across the pavement.her world spinning.


In the hospital room. Lilly lay unconseious, the events of the past two days catching up with her in a sea of nightmares. Her body was still recovering from the trauma. Alexander sat by her side, his eyes filled with worry.He brushed a lock of hair from her forehead, but the sweat beading on her skin spoke of her inner torment. "Please wake up," he whispered, his voice filled with a mixture of hope and despair. "I won't let them get away with this."

The doctors had explained it: the trauma had triggered a deep-seated memory of the day her sisters were taken from her. It had shaken her to the core, and now, Lilly remained in a deep sleep, fighting demons only she could see.


As Alexander sat beside her, the weight of the situation pressed on him.His sister's lífe hung in the balance, and yet all he could think about was Lilly-how close he had come to losing her, just like he had lost so much else in his life. The thought of facing another tragedy was more than he could bear. He couldn't allow it. "I will make them pay," he whispered under his breath, eyes dark with determination. Outside, in the hospital corridor, James stood, watching Alexander, his face grim. The scene before him was a rare one-Alexander,usually the stoic and controlled man, was a shadow of himself, consumed by worry.James knew this was different. This wasn't just about business or revenge. It was personal.
Alexander looked up sharply when he heard James approach. "What are you doing here?" His voice wvas cold,clipped. James raised an eyebrow, unfazed. "You weren't answering your calls," he said simply, "So, I decided to check in."

"Did you find the gang leader?" Alexander's tone remained flat, his eyes never leaving Lilly's face.

"Not yet," James replied. "But we're getting close."

Frustration flared in Alexander's chest. "Then why are you here?!"

"Calm down," James replied, his voice unbothered by Alexander's outburst.
"I'm here about the other matter, the one you asked me to handle."

Alexander didn't flinch, his gaze hardening. "Did you locate the assassin?"he demanded, his patience running thin.

James gave a slight nod. "Yes. Our men are transporting him now."

"Good," Alexander muttered, his eyes burning with a fierce, quiet rage. "Let me know when he arrives."

James crossed his arms, his eyes never leaving Alexander."How can I when you're not answering your phone?" He smirked, clearly not backing down.


Alexander's jaw clenched, but before he could respond, James spoke again."Look, I know things are hard right now, but you need to focus. You have responsibilities, too. You can't let your personal emotions cloud your judgment."

"I know what I'm doing," Alexander retorted sharply. "You can handle the rest."

James wasn't fooled by the cold demeanor. He saw through it-he could read Alexander better than anyone else. "You're afraid," he said, his voice softer now. "Afraid of losing her like you lost them. But Lilly's not the same. She's stronger than you think."

Alexander's eyes flickered with something unreadable before he turned back to Lilly. "Don't waste yourbreath," he muttered, though the weight of his words carried more meaning than James could see. "When she wakes up. I'll make them regret everything. All of them."

James's gaze softened, understanding the depth of Alexander's pain. "You love her, don't you?"

Alexander didn't respond, his gaze fixed on Lilly's pale face. The silence said everything. James could see the raw emotion in his eyes-the fear, the pain, the love. "Tell her how you feel when she wakes up," James added,his voice gentle. "Before it's too late."

After James left, Alexander adjusted Lilly's blanket, carefully tucking it around her. "We've found the assassin," he murmured softly,his voice just above a whisper. "When you wake up, we'll get justice. You won't have to fight this battle alone."

He kissed her hand, his lips lingering for a moment, and then leaned back in his chair, staring at her with determination. "You'll wake up. And when you do,we'll make them pay."
###Chapter 51

Grandma Helen stood at the threshold of the intensive care unit, her hand pressed against the cold, transparent glass. Her eyes, bloodshot from hours of silent vigil, followed the still figure of Sandra lying motionless on the hospital bed, hooked to an array of machines that beeped rhythmically-each pulse a reminder of how fragile life was. The sight of her granddaughter in such a condition brought fresh tears, which she wiped away in vain. "Sandra," she whispered, her voice breaking as she gazed at the girl fighting for her life.

Camila stood beside her, her face ashen, unable to look away from the woman in the bed. "Please recover soon, young miss," she murmured under her breath. It was hard to believe that just two months ago, Sandra had returned home with so much promise, only to find herself on the brink of death.


A few steps behind them, Mr. Blake, the patriarch, stood stoically, his eyes scanning the room before he turned to leave. His thoughts were elsewhere-on his granddaughter's near-fatal encounter. His people were still digging for answers, but he couldn't shake the feeling that things were spiraling beyond his control. The chilling possibility that his granddaughter could have been in Sandra's place sent a wave of anger through him. His fists clenched at the thought.

"How's the investigation progressing?" Caleb demanded, his voice steady but filled with frustration. "Our team is still gathering intel. The mastermind is elusive,covering his tracks well," came the response from one of his most trusted aides. Caleb exhaled sharply, unwilling to give up hope. "Mmmm." James, who had been standing in the corner, watching the scene unfold.took a step forward. "Sir, what did the doctor say about Sandra's condition?"His voice was tinged with a rare sympathy as he glanced at the ICU.

"The doctor said it would take a miracle for her to wake up." Caleb's tone was grim,each word weighed down with the harsh truth.

James nodded, looking towards Lilly, who was still unconscious and pale."And what about Lilly?"


"The doctor says only Lilly can decide when to wake up. She keeps calling out Sandra's name," Caleb replied, his voice softer now, a flicker of helplessness in his eyes.

"Sir, I want you to inform the hospital that we will cover both Miss Sandra's and Lilly's medical expenses from now on," Caleb ordered, his determination not to let them suffer financially despite the grim circumstances.


James hesitated for a moment. "You mean Miss Sandra,right?"

"Yes," Caleb affirmed. "And Lilly's too."

"Sir, with all due respect, you know Alexander won't accept your help,"James warned. "He's too proud."

"'I know." Caleb's jaw tightened. "But I can't sit here and do nothing."

James shifted uncomfortably. "Sir, your son tried to see Lilly. But he wasn't allowed."


Caleb's brow furrowed. "What do you mean he wasn't allowed?"

"According to what I gathered, Alexander has restricted visits. Only you are permitted to see her."

A slow,simmering anger began to rise in Caleb. "Since when?"

"This morning. Mr. Peter came with Bella and Kate, but they were turned away. I heard there was an argument between Alexander and Peter,"James informed him, concern creeping into his voice.

"Hmmm. James, I want you to find out what's going on. Alexander wouldn't have done this without a reason."

James nodded, his tone resolute. "I'll get to the bottom of it,sir."

Meanwhile, in a dark room a few floors up, Kate sat rigidly beside her mother. Bella, her face twisted in frustration. "How did we fail, mother?"she spat, her voice filled with venom. "Lilly should be dead by now.How did those people screw this up so badly?"

Bella remained silent, lost in thought. The thought of Lilly still being alive was a thorn in Kate's side, especially considering her own schemes were at risk of being exposed.

"Mother," Kate hissed, her impatience mounting. "We need to act fast. As long as Lilly is alive, Alexander will keep hating me. If she's gone, I can get close to him, make him see me differently."

Bella's response was slow, deliberate. She didn't even meet Kate's eyes."Shut up." Her voice was sharp, her gaze icy. "You're not thinking straight.Don't you realize te mess we're in right now?"

Kate's frustration boiled over. "What do you mean? We've been planning this for months! If Lilly's out of the way, I can get to Alexander.W′11−′′

"No!" Bella snapped, cutting her off. "Alexander is investigating, and so is your grandfather. They're both looking for answers. Did you not see the rage in Alexander's eyes when he saw you? He knows it's us, Kate. If he discovers the truth about your involvement, he will come after us. And believe me, he won't stop until we're dead."

Kate's breath caught in her throat as the weight of her mother's words hit her. "What do we do now?"


"We need to clean up our mess," Bella growled. "Alexander is dangerous.He'll hunt down anyone connected to this, and we can't afford to let him find the gang leader. We need him dead before your grandfather or Alexander get to him.Fast."

Kate's heart raced as she realized the full scope of their predicament."How soon can you take care of it?"

"I'll make the arrangements," Bella replied, her voice cold, calculating. "But you need to focus on staying out of Alexander's radar. We've gone too far for you to slip up now."

As the pieces fell into place, both Kate and Bella knew that their lives hung by a thread. They needed to act swiftly, or everything they had worked for would crumble. But as the net closed in, one thing was certain-their past mistakes would catch up with them sooner than they expected. And when Alexander finally found out the truth, there would be no place for them to hide.
###Chapter 52

On the outskirts of the city, a dilapidated warehouse concealed a chilling secret-ahidden underground complex with five levels, all kept in complete darknessfrom the outside world. This secluded base was one of many places where Alexander's enemies found themselves brought to face brutal consequences for their betrayals.

In a dimly lit room on the fourth level, Alexander stood over a table cluttered with an array of grim tools and weapons. His icy eyes locked onto a young man, bound and suspended on a stool, with a thick rope cutting into his neck. The room reeked of blood and fear, as the man winced in pain from his ongoing torment. Terror gripped him as he saw the gleaming butcher's knife in Alexander's hand.


"Please..." the captive begged, his voice trembling, as tears ran down his battered face. He had only followed orders to run down a woman,unaware of the dangerous game he was entangled in.


"Please?" Alexander sneered, his voice low and mocking. "Not until I get what I want."


The young man's body trembled violently as he desperately tried to control his breathing. "If I were you, I wouldn't do that," Alexander said,his voice chilling as he watched the man struggle. "A little too much movement, and you'll strangle yourself." "I'd rather die than endure this," the man muttered, his face contorted in pain before he kicked the stool from under him, the rope tightening around his neck.
Alexander's cold gaze never wavered. "Hold him steady," he commanded.His men,hidden in the shadows, swiftly rushed forward, stabilizing the stool, keeping the man from choking to death.


Gasping for air, the man whimpered, his throat raw. "Why won't you just let me die?" he rasped.


"I'm not finished with you," Alexander replied, his voice laced with venom.
He approached the man and plunged the butcher's knife into his foot, the blade sinking deep, causingthe man to scream in agony.

Up above, on the first underground level, Ethan's car screeched to a halt.
A guard greeted him with a nod.

"Where's your boss?" Ethan demanded.

"In the torture room," the guard answered with a somber tone.

Ethan strode toward the elevator, déscending into the depths of the building. He made his way through the shadowy corridors, the unsettling silence broken only by the sound of his boots hitting the cold floor.Reaching the torture room, he swung open the door, revealing the grisly scene: Alexander standing over the tortured young man, blood splattered across the floor.

"Alexander!" Ethan called out, his voice sharp. When Alexander didn't respond, Ethan's frustration boiled over. "Stop!" he shouted, his eyes burning with urgency.

It was only then that Alexander paused, turning toward Ethan, his face unreadable. "Lilly has woken up," Ethan said in a voice thick with urgency, causing Alexander to stop dead in his tracks. The nurse trembled, her voice barely above a whisper. "Dr. Sophia went to the ICU." Alexander's gaze darkened, a dangerous edge creeping into his voice." What did you say? This better not be a joke, or you'll regret it."

"Lilly woke up. I was just at the hospital. You weren't answering your calls, so Richard told me you were here," Ethan continued. Alexander dropped the knife, his face momentarily softening before he made his way toward theexit, but Ethan stepped in front of him.

"Are you really going to see her like this?" Ethan asked,noting the blood stains on Alexander's clothes.


Alexander glanced down at his attire and then dismissed the question,pushing past Ethan with a cold, calculated stride. He made his way to the fifth floor to clean up. Ethan sighed, his gaze lingering on the suffering man in the room.


After a quick shower and a change of clothes, Alexander rushed to the hospital, his mind racing. He arrived to find his bodyguards tense, their faces strained.

"Sophia has taken Lilly out of her room," one of them reported.


The news sent a wave of anger through Alexander. "Where?" he demanded.

"Sophia's office."

Rage simmering beneath his calm exterior, Alexander stormed into the office,but only found a nurse there, clearly flustered.


"Where is the doctor?" he barked, his patience thinning. Realizing where Lilly had been taken, Alexander's heart quickened. He rushed to Sandra's room, his pulse hammering in his ears. As he neared,he could hear the sound of muffled sobbing. There, against the glass,stood Lilly-her face pale, tears streaming down her cheeks as she stared at Sandra's lifeless body. Lilly's hand was connected to an IV drip, her fragile statebarely holding together.

Sophia caught sight of Alexander's approach, her eyes widening in surprise. He walked over to Lilly, gently wrapping his arms around her,offering her a semblance of comfort despite the chaos swirling around them.

"Alexander," Lilly whispered, looking up at him. She had never looked so vulnerable, so broken.


He wiped away her tears with a tender hand. "I'm here," he reassured her,his voice soothing yet firm.

Lilly's voice quivered with guilt. "It's my fault. I was the target, but Sandra's the one fighting for her life."

"Shhh," Alexander hushed her gently, pulling her closer. "It's not your fault. She'll pull through. Don't blame yourself."

Lilly rested her head against his chest, her sobs softening. "You need to rest," he urged. "You're not strong enough yet."

"No," Lilly protested weakly, shaking her head. "I want to stay and watch over her." "Listen to me," he said, cupping her face so she could see the concern in his eyes. "A sick person can't take care of another. You need to recover first. You know that, right?" Lilly reluctantly nodded, but her gaze lingered on Sandra, her heart heavy with the weight of thesituation.


"I caught the hitman," Alexander said, his voice quiet but intense, bringing a flicker of hope to Lilly's eyes. "And the driver who hit Sandra.We're closing in on the gang leader. We'll find out who ordered this."

Lilly's relief was palpable, but she didn't want to be left behind. "I want to be there when you interrogate them."


"You will," Alexander promised, placing a kiss on her forehead. "But first,you need to rest and take care of our baby. Can you do that for me?"


Lilly nodded, the exhaustion evident in her face, yet there was a glimmer of determination behind her eyes.


"Good girl," Alexander whispered, leading her back to her room. As they walked, his eyes shot a chilling glare at Sophia, who was clearly uneasy under the weight of his gaze. He hadn't forgotten that Sophia had taken Lilly out of her room without permission.


Sophia felt a chill crawl up her spine. She knew she was in deep trouble.Desperate, she made her way to Richard for help.


Richard, weary from an eight-hour surgery, was just trying to rest when Sophia barged into his office. She immediately climbed onto the bed,disturbing his peace.


"Richard," she whispered, her voice filled wvith panic. Richard blinked, his eyes softening as he looked at her. "What's wrong,baby?" "I'm in trouble," Sophia confessed, her voice trembling. "I need your help before Alexander sends someone to drag me back to his base."

Richard, now fully awake, sat up in bed. "What did you do?"

Sophia's voice dropped to a guilty whisper. "Lilly woke up... and I..."


Richard's eyes widened. "Lilly finally woke up? That's amazing!"

Sophia nodded, but the dread was still in her voice. "Yes. And when she asked about Sandra, I told her Sandra was fine. But she insisted on seeing her. So, I took her to the ICU. I didn't think Alexander would show up so quickly, but he did. I tried to get Lilly back to her room before he arrived,but..."


Richard sighed deeply, rubbing his forehead. "You've really done it now,haven't you?"


Sophia's face crumpled, terrified. "What's he going to do to me?"

"Don't worry. He won't do anything," Richard said, though his tone lacked conviction.

"Why not?" Sophia asked, looking at him in confusion.

"Because Lilly is his weakness," Richard replied with quiet certainty. "If Lilly pleads for you, he won't touch you."

Sophia breathed a sigh of relief, but it was short-lived as the reality of her actions settled in. "I hope you're right," she muttered.

Richard lay back down, pulling the covers up to his chest. "Now,go to sleep. You're safe for now. But remember, fear of Alexander is the first step to wisdom."

Sophia snuggled beside him, still uneasy but grateful for the small comfort his words gave her. As Richard drifted off to sleep. she lay awake.wondering just how far Alexander's wrath would stretch.
###Chapter 53

"My heart is at ease now that you and the baby are okay. What happened eo Sandra is  terrible," Sarah murmured, her voice laced with concern as she adjusted Lilly's blanket, sitting next to him on the hospital bed. She had rushed to be by his side the moment she learned Lilly had woken up the previous day.


Lilly let out a heavy sigh. "I was the intended target. They thought it was me, but it was Sandra they hit instead."


Sarah's expression darkened. "Im certain it was Bella and Kate," she said with quiet conviction.


Lilly nodded, her gaze hardening. "Kate came to my office earlier that day,spouting nonsense. Then the accident happened."

Sarah clenched her fists. "If I get my hands on Kate, she'll regret it. Her and that wicked mother of hers."


They'Il pay for everything they've done," Lilly vowed, her voice thick with determination. "And it won't be long before they're behind bars."


Sarah nodded in agreement. "You should tell your grandfather,Lilly.He'll be shocked when he sees the news."


Lilly paused, her thoughts racing. She needed Bella and Kate to confess,to reveal the truth to the world in front of her grandfather. The last thing she wanted was for him to learn about it like everyone else, through the media.


"You're right," Lilly finally said.11Alexander mentioned the same thing earlier. I'll prepare to tell him when he visits tomorrow."

"I ean't wait for this to be over. For Sandra to recover." Sarah's voice

 
softened.

"Me too," Lilly agreed.

"By the way..." Lilly glanced around the room, suddenly noticing the absence of certain familiar faces. "Where are Jacob and Michael? Don't they know I'm awake?"

Sarah hesitated, a strange smile playing on her lips. "Well.."

Lilly raised an eyebrow, sensing something amiss."What?"

Sarah's smile widened. "You didn't tell me that Alexander was the jealous type," she teased, her eyes sparkling with amusement.

Lilly stared at her, confusion clouding her expression. "What are you talking about?"


"Don't act surprised," Sarah grinned. "When you woke up, Michael and Jacob came with me to see you. But Alexander wouldn't let them in."

Lilly blinked in disbelief. "Are you serious?"

Sarah nodded. "Michael and Alexander had an... altercation, just the second day you were hospitalized."

Lilly's jaw dropped. "What? No way." Sarah's face turned serious.′′Itwas intense. If Alexander hadn't held himself back, he could have hurt Michael badly. But he didn't want you to wake up and find out something happened to him." Lilly had to sit up a little, the shock evident on her face. "What happened exactly?" Sarah sighed, her tone turning more serious. "We rushed to the hospital when we heard what happened. But Alexander's guards wouldn't let us in to see you. Alexander came out of the VIP room, saw us standing there,and allowed me in, but not Jacob or Michael. He said they weren't needed.Michael got angry, though. He insisted he had the right to see his friend,which triggered the altercation."


Lilly couldn't believe what she was hearing. "Michael told him he's been in my life longer and knows me better. That made Alexander lose his cool."

"Exactly," Sarah confirmed, her eyes filled with disbelief. "He had his guards throw Michael and Jacob out. Even though Jacob hadn't said a word."


Lilly stared at Sarah, her mind racing. "I didn't think Alexander would ever do that."


Sarah almost laughed at Lilly's shock. "Well, now that he has feelings for you,you're going to see a side of him you've never seen before. Trust me,Alexander isn't just the tough, commanding CEO. He's also an overprotective, jealous husband in the making."


Lilly's thoughts were interrupted by a voice that made her heart skip a beat.


"I don't want any man near you," Alexander's voice echoed through the room, his cold gaze locked on Lilly as he entered, his presence commanding. Lilly blinked, caught off guard by his sudden arrival. She opened her mouth, but words failed her. The intensity of Alexander's gaze made her hesitate. "You didn't let Jacob and Michael see mne," Lilly said, her tone betraying her confusion. "They're family-close friends who've been with me for years. They have every right to be here."

Alexander's jaw tightened. "You shouldn't have male friends."

Lilly was speechless. Sarah had warned her, but she never expected Alexander to be this insecure.


"But they're family," Lilly insisted, hoping to reason with him.

Alexander didn't flinch, his expression unreadable. His silence hung heavy between them.


Finally, after a long pause, he exhaled, his voice quiet but firm. "Fine.They can see you."


Lilly's lips curved into a small smile, relieved. Without thinking, she threw her arms around him, hugging him tightly. She couldn't deny the flutter in her chest-seeing Alexander so possessive, so jealous, made her heart race.


He hugged her back, his hold tightening. "You'll be discharged tomorrow,"he murmured.

"Really?" Lilly looked up at him, her eyes wide with surprise.


"Yes," Alexander confirmed. "We'll go home tomorrow after we visit Sandra." Lilly pulled back from the embrace, her mind racing. "Ineed to see my grandfather tomorrow before we leave," she said, her voice steady but resolute. "Why?" Alexander asked, his brow furrowing. "He can visit you since you're the one who's been sick."

Lilly's gaze hardened. "I need to tell him, Alexander. I need to tell him everything before he finds out from the media."


Alexander's eyes widened slightly, realizing what Lilly meant. "You've decided to tell him?"


Lilly nodded. "Yes. The truth needs to come out, and I want him to hear it from me first."


Alexander fell silent for a moment, his eyes dark with thought. "What about your father? Won't you forgive him?"

Lilly's face hardened at the mention of her father. "I want him to be more remorseful," she said, her voice cutting through the tension. "I need him to understand the damage he caused-how he destroyed his family and lost two of his children because of his actions. Only then will I forgive him."

Alexander stared at her, his gaze faraway, as though his thoughts were drifting to something painful.

Lilly watched him closely, sensing the weight of his unspoken thoughts.His silence made her wonder if the mention of her father had triggered something from his past-something he wasn't ready to share.


"Alexander," Lilly said gently, her hand reaching out to him, "I hope one day you'll open up to me. I want to understand... what's hurting you."She knew the truth, but part of her wanted him to speak it out loud. Alexander didn't respond. Instead, he stared at her, his expression unreadable. After a few moments, he leaned down and kissed her forehead,his touch soft but intense. "It's late," he said, his voice low. "You should sleep."

Lilly nodded, though her mind was still buzzing with everything that had been said. "You need rest too," she murmured. "You haven't slept in days."

Alexander smirked."Okay, but only if you give me a kiss first."

Lilly smiled, her heart warming at his words. She leaned in and kissed him without hesitation. As the kiss deepened,she could feel the weight of the world lift off her shoulders for just a moment, the quiet comfort of being in his arms almost enough to make her forget everything else.


Meanwhile, in the cold confines of a high-security prison, a woman sat alone, her eyes fixed on a business magazine. A photograph of Alexander graced the cover, and as she ran her fingers over the image, a wicked smile spread across her lips. Her dark eyes gleamed with something dangerous,a spark of recognition.

"You've grown up well, Alexander," she whispered to herself, her voice laced with an unsettling mixture of pride and malice.

The woman's features were strikingly similar to Alexander's, the same dark eyes, the same sharp features. But the warmth in her gaze was absent.replaced by a cruel smile as she continued to study the picture.


The past was never far behind, and it was only a matter of time before Alexander would have to face it.
###Chapter 54

Bella rushed out of the elevator, her heart racing as she shoved past the employees who greeted her with puzzled glances. Her mind was consumed with a singular thought: get to Kate. She stormed down the hallway,her footsteps echoing with urgency, until she reached her daughter's office.The door flew open with a crash, startling Kate, who looked up, eyes wide with surprise.


"Mom, what are you doing here?" Kate asked, confusion and concern mixing in her tone.


Without a word. Bella rushed in, her hands gripping Kate's arms as she yanked her to her feet. Kate stumbled, caught off guard by the force. "Why are you pulling me? What's going on?" she demanded, her voice sharp with alarm.


"We need to leave," Bella said, her voice taut with panic, the words a command rather than a suggestion.


Kate's confusion deepened. "What do you mean, we need to leave? And let go of my hand,Mom."


Bella released her but began pacing back and forth, her movements sharp and agitated. Kate could feel the tension radiating from her mother, and something in her gut told her this was more than just a fleeting moment of anxiety. "What's going on, Mom?" she asked, her voice steady despite the rising dread in her chest. "We need to leave," Bella repeated, this time her eyes flashing with intensity as she turned to face her. The urgency in her tone made Kate's heart skip a beat. Leave? What do you mean?" Kate's voice wavered slightly as she stood frozen, trying to process her mother's frantic words.

Bella's eyes locked onto hers with an unblinking stare. "The man I hired to eliminate the gang leader has gone missing. That means Alexander already has him. And... I've just heard word from the people watching him. They said he was taken by a group of men. I'm sure it's Alexander's people."

Kate's breath caught in her throat, a cold wave of dread washing over her."What??" she gasped, her mind reeling with the implications.

"Keep your voice down," Bella hissed, her hand gripping Kate's wrist,pulling her closer. "Don't let anyone hear."

Kate's mind raced, her pulse quickening. "You mean he already knows...about Lilly's sisters? About the accident with his sister?" Fear surged through her as she realized the weight of Bella's words.

"Yes," Bella whispered harshly, "which is why we need to leave now. It's only a matter of time before he comes for us."


Kate's thoughts scrambled, her mind racingfor a solution. "Leave? Where to?"


Bella's eyes darkened with resolve. "We have to flee the country. We're not safe here anymore. I'll have one of our most trusted maids bring our valuables to a safe location. We need to withdraw every penny from our accounts, then leave by ship. I've already made arrangements." Kate froze. The idea of abandoning everything, her position, her life, was almost unthinkable. Yet the cold dread in her stomach told her there was no other choice. Bella grabbed her hand again. pulling her toward the door. "Come on, we don't have time to waste."


But Kate didn't move. She stood there, her mind reeling with what her mother had just proposed. Bella turned sharply, her expression fierce."Kate!! There's no time to think about what we're leaving behind.If we don't leave now, we're dead."


Kate's face drained of color as the realization hit her.′′Ithere no other way?" she whispered, her voice trembling.


Bella's gaze softened for a moment, but only just. "Not right now. The only way to save ourselves is to run."

Kate nodded. though her mind was still clouded with doubt and fear. But Bella had already started pulling her toward the exit, leading her through the back halls of the company. As they moved swiftly, Kate could only wonder how deep the web of lies and betrayal had gone. There was no turning back now.




"I'll visit you every day, Sandra. Goodbye," Lilly whispered softly,standing just outside the ICU room. The doctor had said her sister's condition was improving, but she still lay unconscious, trapped in a coma. They were waiting for the moment she would wake up, but that moment seemed so distant. Alexander stood next to her, his eyes tender as he gazed at his sister. "Get welI soon, Sandra," he said, his voice low with emotion.′′Bythe time you wake up, those responsible for this will pay with their lives." Lilly could see  the fire of vengeance in his eyes, and she placed a hand over his, offering what little comfort she could.

Just then, Alexander's phone buzzed. He glanced at it but didn't answer.Lilly raised an eyebrow.


"It might be important," she suggested softly.

Reluctantly, Alexander answered the call. "What is it?" His tone was sharp,the impatience clear.


"They've figured out we have the gang leader and the assassin. They're planning to flee the country," James reported, urgency in his voice.

Alexander's eyes darkened. He looked at Lilly, his expression unreadable."Your stepmother and stepsister are planning to escape."

"What?" Lilly's heart sank. The idea of Bella and Kate fleeing now, after everything that had happened, filled her with dread. If they escaped,they would never face justice for what they had done.

"I'll send the driver and a few men to get you to your grandfather's place.Once you've told him the truth, he can follow you to the base. By then, we'1l have caught them," Alexander promised, his voice steady with determination.


Lilly's heart was heavy with the weight of the situation, but she nodded."Okay. Promise me you'll catch them."


"There's no way they can escape," Alexander assured her. He kissed her forehead gently. "Please, stay safe." "I will," Lilly said softly, her heart aching as she watched him leave to meet James. Lilly arrived at the Blake estate later that day, her mind a whirlwind of thoughts. Victor greeted her at the door, his face a picture of polite respect.

"Welcome,Young Miss," he said, bowing slightly.

"Thank you, Uncle," Lilly smiled faintly. "Where's Grandfather?"

"He's waiting for you."

Lilly followed him toward her grandfather's study, but as they neared the door, something stopped her in her tracks. Victor turned to look at her.

"Is something wrong, Young Miss?" he asked, his concern evident.


Lilly hesitated, then shook her head. "You can go back, Victor. I'll go in alone."


Victor studied her for a moment, sensing the tension in her demeanor.But he nodded and stepped back, leaving her standing before the door.

Taking a deep breath, Lilly steeled herself. She knocked on the door,then entered at the sound of her grandfather's voice.


Inside,Caleb sat at his desk, writing as always. When he saw her,he smiled warmly,setting down his pen and walking over to embrace her.The hug was unexpected, and Lilly's heart clenched in both surprise and longing. She hadn't realized how much she had missed her grandfather's embrace. "Good day, Grandfather," she greeted softly as he pulled away. Caleb frowned as he examined her face. "You look unwell. Why didn't you rest instead of coming here?" Lilly smiled faintly. "There's something I need to tell you."

Her grandfather's expression softened,sensing the gravity of the situation."What is it, my child?"

Lilly swallowed, gathering the strength to speak. "I don't know how to tell you this, Grandfather," she whispered, her voice trembling. "But... my sisters and mnother, they were killed by..."

Caleb's gaze sharpened. "You know who did it?"

Lilly nodded, her heart heavy. "Yes, I know. I've been investigating. And right now, as we speak, the assassin is locked up at one of Alexander's bases."


The words hung in the air, a chilling truth settling into the room.

###Chapter 55

"Did you capture the assassin?" Lilly's grandfather's voice was like ice,his eyes burning with a silent fury.


Lilly's nod was all the confirmation he needed. The darkness in his gaze deepened. “Bring him to me. I will have him executed for what he did to my granddaughters. Who sent him?" His words were sharp, like a bladle,the muscles of his jaw taut with restraint. His rarely seen emotions now emerged with the weight of every painful memory of his lost granddaughters.


"He confessed under severe torture," Lilly replied, her voice a whisper in the stillness."He revealed those who hired him."


Her grandfather's expression shifted, his anger now like a tempest in his eyes."Who are they?" he demanded, barely containing the violence in his tone.


Lilly reached into her bag, her fingers trembling as she retrieved her phone.She tapped a few buttons, and a video began to play-a recording of the confession, the words too heavy for her to speak aloud. The screen flickered to life, showing a bloodied man, his face distorted with pain, his body marked by scars of countless betrayals.

"I... was paid to kill them," the man rasped.

A low, calm voice echoed from off-camera."Who hired you?" "Two women," the man croaked, wincing at the pain coursing through him. "One young... the other older. They never told me their names." The camera zoomed in on two photos, each framed with deliberate precision. The older woman was unmistakable.

Lilly's grandfather's eyes hardened, his lips pressing into a thin line as he scanned the images. His voice was a venomous whisper. "Recognize her?"

"Yes," the assassin muttered, his voice barely audible. "She's the one who paid me.”


"And this one?” Alexander's voice remained cold, showing the photo of Kate.


The man recoiled slightly, his gaze flickering with recognition.“She came with the older one... called her 'mother.'"

Lilly's grandfather slammed his fist onto the table, the impact loud and deafening in the tense silence. His eyes burned with unrestrained rage."How dare they! I should have seen it-should have known! I let that filth into our family!"


“Guards!" he bellowed, his voice echoing through the cold, vast space. Two men rushed in, their faces blank and obedient.

“Yes,sir.”


“Find Bella and Kate. Bring them to the torture room!" His voice was ice-cold, the weight of his fury now fully realized.


Lilly stood, her voice cuttíng through the thick tension. “You won't find them," she said, her words chilling the air around them. “A few months after I disappeared," she admitted, the guilt weighing on her like a suffocating blanket. “What do you mean?" her grandfather growled, the fire in his voice sparking again. "They must pay for what they've done!” His gaze turned to ice as he fixed her with an accusing glare. "And you didn't think to tell me? After everything that happened?" "They're already gone," Lilly explained, her voice firm despite the turmoil inside her. "They're trying to flee the country. Alexander and his men are already in pursuit."

Her grandfather's face twisted with frustration. "Then I'll send more men.
They won't get far."

"No need," Lilly said, her gaze unwavering."“Alexander will catch them.
He has it under control."

The old man's teeth ground together as he turned away, pacing.“Do you expect me to sit here and do nothing while they escape?!"

Lilly's heart skipped a beat, but she remained calm. "No, Grandfather.We'Il go to Alexander's base. Once he catches them, they'll be brought there."

Her grandfather's eyes darkened with determination. “What are we waiting for, then? Get the cars ready!" he barked, his orders swift and cutting.


The car ride was heavy with tension. Lilly noticed her grandfather's stare,his eyes distant, lost in the abyss of his thoughts. The muscles in his clenched fist betrayed the storm of emotions brewing inside him.


“How long have you known?" he asked, his voice low and dangerous. Lilly's stomach dropped, the question she'd been dreading finally coming to the surface. She'd kep t this secret for too long, and now the weight of it crushed her. "I'm sorry." she whispered, her voice fragile.

"Sorry?!" he roared, his face contorting with anger."After what they did?And you kept this from me? Victoria and Shigella are dead, and you let them walk free. You let them worm their way into our family, into our lives!" He was trembling with fury, his voice a dangerous whisper."And Alexander knew before I did?"

"I didn't want to burden you," she replied, her voice barely a breath."After everything. I didn't want to add to your pain."

His anger didn't subside.“Pain?*Pain*?You should've told me. Lilly! Do you know what I've lost? What we've all lost because of their deceit? I trusted Kate. I gave her everything, made her CEO. And she's nothing but a murderer!”


"I'm sorry," she repeated, her voice cracking.

He turned away, his fists clenched, each word from his mouth a stinging lash.“I'm going to make them pay for this," he said, his voice cold as steel.“When we get there, I'll deal with them myself."

Lilly hesitated but finally spoke. "Alexander won't let you."

Her grandfather turned sharply, eyes blazing. “And why the hell not?”

"Because they caused Sandra's accident," Lilly said, her voice barely above a whisper. "She's in the hospital, fighting for her life.,, and it's all because of them. I wastheir target, Grandfather. But Sandra.., she was hit instead."

The words hung in the air,a dagger aimed straight at the heart. Lilly's grandfather froze, his body rigid with rage.

"They deserve death. All of them," he growled, his voice a promise of
violence.

**Earlier that Day:**

Kate and her mother had been frantically gathering their things, preparing to flee,when the walls of their escape collapsed around them. A voice cut through the air, familiar and cold.

“Not so fast.”

It was James, Alexander's most trusted associate. The look on Kate's face soured in an instant.


“Damn it, we're finished," Kate hissed under her breath, realizing how close James was to Alexander. He was sent after them, and there was no escaping now.

"So,trying to run from your sins, are we?” James' voice was calm,but the malice in it was clear. "Seize them!" he ordered.

The men around them moved swiftly, expertly neutralizing the threat as they injected both women with a tranquilizer, rendering them unconscious before they could react.

Hours later, cold water splashed across their faces,jolting them awake. The harsh light was blinding, the room oppressive. They were tied to chairs.their vision blurry as they tried to make sense of their surroundings.Bloodstains on the floor, ominous shadows creeping along the walls, and the cold chill in the air all sent waves of terror through them. Then, three battered men were dragged in, tied to chairs opposite them.Bella's heart lurched when she recognized two of them-the assassin and the gang leader. In a distant, sterile room, Alexander watched everything unfold on a screen.The sharp contrast between the pristine, modern control room and the filth of the torture chamber was chilling.


"Alexander, they've arrived," James's voice called as he entered the room.

Alexander nodded silently, his expression unreadable. He stood up, ready to face what was about to unfold, and followed James to the warehouse. It was time for the reckoning.


As Lilly and her grandfather arrived, they were greeted by an empty, eerie warehouse.The air felt still, like a trap waiting to spring.

"Is this the place?" her grandfather asked, his suspicion growing.

Lilly scanned the surroundings, noting the hidden guards lurking in the shadows.


"Yes,” Pedro confirmed, his voice a whisper. "This is where he told us to come.”


Suddenly, the sound of a door creaking open echoed through the quiet.Alexander emerged, his figure tall and commanding, his gaze locking onto Lilly's grandfather.


“Alexander," Lilly called, rushing to him.

He embraced her, his eyes briefly meeting her grandfather's. “Did you capture them?” "I did," her grandfather replied, his voice still laced with fury. "I'll let you decide their fate." Lilly exhaled, relief washing over her. She knew, at long last, Bella and Kate's time had come.

As they made their way underground, Lilly felt her curiosity stir. Thebase was hidden away beneath the earth-a secret lair of sorts.


"Why underground?" she asked, the question burning on her tongue.

"It's a story for another time." Alexander replied cryptically.

Her grandfather, however, was not so patient. His frustration was evident.and his foot tapped impatiently as they descended into the depths.

The doors opened to reveal a hallway that stretched out before them-dark,cold, and endless. But it was the clean, organized monitoring room that caught Lilly's attention. It stood in stark contrast to the bloody torture chamber she saw on the screen, and she shuddered at the thought of what was happening to her enemies in real-time.


Her grandfather's anger was palpable as he clenched his fists. “Take me to them.”


Alexander didn't hesitate. He signaled for a guard to escort him. But just as Lilly took a step to follow, Alexander's grip stopped her, his eyes softening as he wiped away her silent tears.


“Why are you stopping me?" she asked, her voice breaking.

“Because youI can't go in there," he said quietly, his gaze firm yet gentle.
###Chapter 56

He turned Lilly to face him, his gaze falling on the tears that stained her cheeks. With a tenderness born of deep care, he wiped them away, hislips brushing her forehead in a soft kiss.


"Why are you stopping me?" she asked, her voice fragile,strained by emotion.

"Because you can't go in there," he replied, his tone unyielding.

"But I have to!" Her hands trembled as she reached out, her words sharp with pain. "You promised I couId see them. They killed my sisters. I need to make them pay, to make them suffer."

Alexander's jaw tightened. He understood the torment in her eyes more than anyone else, but he couldn't allow this. Not like this.

"No,”"he said firmly,his voice final.

"Please," she begged, her tears falling freely now. Her words were raw,desperate. "I need to feel it, Alexander. I need to vent my anger."

He took her hands in his, pressing them gently to his lips. "I won't let your hands be stained," he whispered, his voice laced with both regret and determination. "You're not like them. You're not like us. Your grandfather will handle this-he will take care of it for you. You'll watch. And you'll make the final decision." Lilly shook her head, her heart in turmoil.′′Iwant to be there! I want to make them feel every ounce of the pain they caused." But Alexander's resolve never wavered. He held her close, determined to shield her from what lay beyond that door. She wasn't ready, and neither 
was he willing to let her be.

Inside the room, the tension was palpable. Bella and Kate's faces drained of color as they saw who had entered.

“Grandfather..." Kate's voice faltered, and in an instant, her defiance was met with the sting of a brutal slap that sent her chair crashing backward.

“How dare you call me that, you traitor?" Bella's voice was cold, but fear flashed in her eyes. She knew her life was slipping away. There was no saving them now. Her blood would be spilled tonight.

Bella remained silent, the weight of her crimes hanging over her like a death sentence. She had killed his granddaughters. There would be no mercy for her.


“Take them away!" her grandfather commanded with chilling authority.His men moved swiftly, securing ropes around their necks and hoisting them to the ceiling. The air was thick with tension, and Lilly could feel the anger bubbling inside her, even from the other room.

She stared at the monitor, her eyes glued to the screen. Her breath caught as she watched them suffocate, only to be pulled down and tortured further. A hot knife seared their skin, and their screams echoed in the silence. Her grandfather's methodical cruelty matched the vengeance she had longed for. But it wasn't enough. Not yet. She'd demanded they suffer longer. She didn't want them to die quickly. They needed to know what it felt like to lose everything. For over an hour, Lilly watched her family's torment. Her grandfather,unyielding, never relented. He carved marks into their flesh, left scars that would never fade, each stroke a reminder of their treachery. Bella, the monster in disguise, had also killed his real daughter-in-law.Her punishment was even harsher.

Lilly's mind reeled with the new discovery-that Bella had also been responsible for her mother's death. A bitter fury coiled deep within her.But Alexander stood by her side, watching her, sensing the storm within her.


When the ordeal became too much to bear, Alexander stepped in,blocking the monitor with his body.


"Why are you blocking the screen?”Lilly demanded, her voice raw with frustration. "I haven't had enough yet."


"It's been over an hour already," he replied, his tone soft but resolute."That's enough."


"You're denying me my justice," she hissed, the anger in her eyes burning brighter than before. "I'm not done."

“Lilly, you don't need to witness any more of this. It's too much for you to bear." His hand gently combed through her hair, his touch tender,almost protective.

"I can handle it!" she snapped, her voice trembling. "I still want to see them suffer. I want to look them in the eye and make them understand what they've done to me, to my family." “You will. After they're locked away for good. After they've been sentenced to life," he promised her, his voice filled with determination. But even as he spoke, he could see the anguish in her eyes. Lilly wasn't just looking for revenge-she was searching for something deeper, something only she could understand.

Back in the chamber of punishment, the minutes dragged on, each second stretching as her grandfather's men worked methodically, coldly. Bella and Kate cried for mercy, pleading for an end, but their cries were ignored.No amount of begging would save them. Their fates were sealed.

Eventually, they collapsed, their bodies limp. Each time they fell unconscious, they were revived with ice-cold water, only to be subjected to more torture. Her grandfather didn't want them to die too quickly. His plan had always been for them to suffer and then rot away in prison.

The sounds of their torment finally ceased when her grandfather, satisfied with the punishment, left the room to cleanse his hands of the blood.

One of his men approached him, indicating three other men tied to chairs,gagged and trembling from what they'd witnessed.

“What should we do with them?" the guard asked.

"Dispose of them," her grandfather ordered coldly, not sparing them another glance.


The last thing he wanted was for Lilly to witness their deaths. Alexander had already ensured she would only see the aftermath of the punishment,a decision he knew she would later thank him for.


As her grandfather returned to the room where Lilly and Alexander waited.his heart clenched. Lilly was crying in Alexander's arms, the weight of it all crashing down on her.

In that moment, he realized the truth of it all-his daughter-in-law and granddaughters had been lost because of his failure to protect them. The betrayal that ran through their bloodlines had cost him everything,and now his own family was fractured beyond repair.

He swore to himself, he would never let this happen again.

**********

Back at home. Peter walked in to an oppressive silence. Victor, his ever-faithful aide, greeted him quietly. But there was an edge to the air,a tension that made Peter's skin crawl.

"Where is everyone?”he asked,eyes scanning the room.

Victor hesitated, as though weighing his words carefully."Lilly was here earlier,"he said, his voice barely a whisper.

Peter's heart sank. "Lilly? But... she was supposed to be in the hospital."His mind raced with worry.


Victor nodded. guiding Peter to the second-floor living room, where a shocking sight awaited. Peter's eyes widened as the TV flickered to life,revealing Bella and Kate, their heads shaved, their bodies marked with burns and scars.


"What... is going on?" Peter's voice cracked with disbelief. "Why are they being taken to prison?"


Victor remained silent, allowing the reporter to continue. The words sent Peter into a spiral of shock. The evidence laid bare before him,and the truth of theircrimes came crashing down like a storm. His body went cold as the report revealed the murders of his daughters,his wife-and the dark role Bella and Kate had played in his family's destruction. Peter stood motionless, his world shattering around him as the reality of the monstrous people he'd shared his life with became undeniable.
How could he have been so blind?
 

###Chapter 57

The judge's voice echoed through the courtroom,cold and final:"Based on all the evidence presented. I sentence Bella Blake and Kate Blake to life imprisonment for multiple charges. including manslaughter." The gavel struck,punctuating the silence that followed.

"All rise!" the court clerk called, signaling the end of the trial.

Everyone stood as the judge departed, leaving behind the weight of justice.Lilly's chest tightened as the finality of the verdict settled in. She had done it-she had succeeded in bringing them to justice,and the truth was now laid bare for the world to see. But as she watched Bella and Kate being led out through the back door, a sudden chill gripped her. Bella's smirk lingered in her mnind like a shadow, and something in that twisted smile set her heart racing with unease.

Alexander,standing close by,noticed the change in her demeanor. "What's wrong?"he asked,his voice laced with concern.

Lilly forced a smile, but it didn't reach her eyes. "Nothing, Just... relieved.Now my sisters and mother can rest in peace."

Alexander studied her closely, his sharp gaze sensing the depth of her unrest. He opened his mouth to speak, but the words died on his tongue as he chose not to press further, respecting her silence. Peter nodded, tears welling in his eyes. "I know everything, Lilly.Everything that happened... it's my fault. I destroyed our family. I lost your mother because of my betrayal, and now... I've lost my daughters.I'm ready to accept whatever punishment you think I deserve. Please, just...forgive me." her name, halting her steps. She froze, dread crawling up her spine as she turned to see Peter approaching.


Her frown deepened.

"We can leave if you don't want to talk to him," Alexandler offered,his voice quiet but firm.

Lilly hesitated for only a moment before answering, her voice low and steady. "I can't keep avoiding him forever. We need to have this conversation.”


Alexander nodded, his expression softening. “Do you want to speak with him privately?"

Lilly gave a brief nod, and with a reassuring kiss on her forehead,Alexander walked toward the car, leaving them alone.

Peter reached her, his face drawn and weary, as if the last few weeks had aged him years. He stood before her, his shoulders slumped under the weight of his remorse. "I'm sorry... please," he whispered,his voice cracking with guilt.

Lilly looked at him, fury and disbelief mixing with the sorrow in her heart."You're sorry?" she repeated, her voice trembling with emotion. His words, though heavy with regret, only fueled the anger burning within her."Why are you only realizing now how much you've ruined everything? Why?!" Lilly's voice cracked as the tears began to fall.

The onlookers outside the courthouse turned, sensing the tension in the air.Alexander, who had been watching from a distance, rushed over the moment he saw the tears in Lilly's eyes. His eyes locked on Peter with a fierce,protective glare, but he said nothing, focusing only on Lilly as he wiped her tears away.


“Do you want to leave now?" Alexander asked, his voice gentle but insistent.

Lilly nodded, her voice breaking. “Please take me away.”

Alexander didn't need to hear more. He pulled her into his arms, offering what little comfort he could. “Shh, it's okay. We're leaving now,"he murmured,guiding her to the car, his presence a steadying force.

Peter stood frozen, tears streaming down his face as he watched the car drive away. His heart clenched with the realization that it had taken him losing everything to understand the depth of his failure. His eyes lingered on the car, filled with regret, as he whispered to himself, "I won't stop seeking your forgiveness."


In the car, Lilly stared out the window, lost in her thoughts. She could feel Alexander's gaze on her, soft but unwavering. He placed his hand over hers,a simple gesture that brought a sense of peace she desperately needed.

"It's all over now," Alexander said quietly. Lilly nodded, though her heart was still heavy. "It's over." He moved closer, wrapping his arms around her and kissing her forehead. 
"Thinking about your father?"

Lilly's eyesclosed briefly as the emotions swirled within her.∘YesHe's so selfish."


"You were disappointed in him. I saw it in your eyes," Alexander said,his voice low and understanding.


She nodded again, feeling the weight of betrayal and disillusionment.“I just want this period to pass."

"It will," Alexander reassured her, brushing a stray lock of hair from her face."I'll make sure it does. So you can focus on our new family... on me,and our unborn child."


A week later, on the anniversary of her sisters' deaths, Lilly stood before her mirror, dressed in all black-gown, shoes,gloves,and a veil draped over her head. The weight of the day pressed heavily on her shoulders,but there was a strange comfort in the routine of honoring them.

She took the elevator down to the sitting room, where Alexander was reading the newspaper. His smile, warm and sincere, made her heart flutter despite the heaviness in her chest. The simple act of seeing him made everything feel more bearable.


“You look beautiful," he said, standing as she entered the room.His arms wrapped around her waist, pulling her into a gentle kiss. “Even in all black.”

Lilly blushed, a small smile tugging at her lips. "Thank you." Alexander cupped her cheek with his hand,his thumb brushing over her skin tenderly, "Where do you want to go first?The grave...or the prison?" Lilly hesitated, her mind weighing both options. "The prison first. I need to say my final piece."

Alexander studied her for a moment, as if sensing the weight of her decision. Then he nodded, a quiet understanding between them.“I'll be there with you."


They left for the women's prison, a journey of three hours that allowed Lilly time to settle her thoughts. When they arrived, the strict security measures gave her a sense of uneasy relief. The thought of Bella and Kate escaping haunted her nightmares, but seeing the prison's tight security calmed her. Alexander's own efforts to ensure their confinement brought her a measure of peace.


They were led into a VIP visitors' room, and though Lilly felt exhausted,she refused to let herself falter. She couldn't afford to.


Thirty minutes later, the door opened. Two female officers entered.escorting Bella and Kate-both in prison uniforms, disheveled and defeated. yet something in their eyes remained defiant.


Lilly's pulse quickened, a flood of emotions surging within her. Anger,sadness, and an odd sense of pity all collided in her chest. She had prepared herself for this moment, but nothing could have prepared her for seeing them so broken yet still capable of defiance.

As they took their seats across from Lilly and Alexander, Bella's eyes remained sharp, filled with a quiet rage, while Kate seemed resigned to her fate. Her once-strong spirit had crumbled. Lilly exhaled, steadying herself before speaking."I needed to see you both one last time," she began, her voice shaky but determined. "To understand why you did what you did... and to tell you that, despite everything,I hope you find some form of redemption here."
###Chapter 58
Upon their arrival at the prison, the tension in the air was palpable. Kate and Bella had no words for their visitors at first. As they were led into the room, they looked at Alexander, his expression cold and unreadable, and then shifted their gaze to Lilly. Despite their grim surroundings, there was still a flicker of emotion in Kate's eyes-an ache, a longing-for something lost. Lilly noticed it, but she wasn't interested in playing that game.

The glass barrier between them seemed to magnify the silence, but Lilly's resolve remained firm. She walked to a seat, sat down, and picked up the telephone. The air was thick with anticipation as Alexander stood behind her,watching with an intensity that mirrored her own.

Kate and Bella mirrored their actions, lifting the phones to their ears, their eyes never leaving Lilly.

Lilly's voice broke through the silence, her tone calm but laced with unspoken fury."How does it feel to be here? I bet you never imagined your lives would end like this." Her gaze never wavered from Bella. “You'Il rot in here for the rest of your lives. All the harm you've done to my family, it's time you paid for it."

Bella's eyes flashed for a split second-was it defiance? Lilly couldn't tell,and it unsettled her. She had expected Bella to react, to show some sign of the person she once knew, but Bella remained stone-faced. It was unnerving. Lilly leaned closer, her voice low and dangerous. “You'll regret ever crossing me. I will make sure you never see the light of day again." Her eyes locked with Bella's, searching for any hint of fear-but there was nothing. Turning her attention to Kate, Lilly's gaze softened just for a moment.but the venom in her words remained. "And you, Kate. You'll never get out of here. Not now, not ever. You think Alexander's going to come rescue you?You're wrong."

Kate's eyes flickered, but it was fleeting-she quickly masked the emotion,her fingers trembling around the receiver. Lilly knew that, deep down,Kate's feelings for Alexander hadn't disappeared. But it was irrelevant now. Lilly was no longer that naive girl.

With a final look at the two women, Lilly put the phone down and stood.“I said what I needed to say," she murmured, her voice steely as she turned away, her hand brushing against Alexander's as he walked her out.

As they drove away, the weight of the visit settled over her like a heavy fog."You did what you needed to," Alexander assured her, his voice steady."They won't escape. I've made sure of it."

Lilly didn't feel reassured. The unease that had gnawed at her since the trial still lingered. Bella was too calm, too collected-something wasn't right. She couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to this than met the eye.

Several hours later, they arrived at the graveyard. Lilly took the flowers from the bodyguards, her movements slow and deliberate. As they approached the family plot, she froze. Someone was kneeling by the graves,crying softly. It was Peter. Alexander stood at her side, his gaze hard as he observed the scene. Peter was a broken man, his shoulders hunched in sorrow, his eyes red-rimmed with regret. He had been there for over an hour, paying tribute to the daughters he had failed. The assistant standing off to the side had never seen him cry, and even he couldn't help but feel the weight of the moment.

Lilly's eyes narrowed, her pulse quickening. She wasn't prepared for this confrontation,not today.

Peter stood as he noticed their approach. His eyes were bloodshot, his movements sluggish. "I came to ask for their forgiveness,"he said,his voice cracking.

"You're leaving?"Lilly asked, her voice trembling with a mix of disbelief and anger.

Peter nodded slowly. "I'm leaving in three hours. I have to. I've lost everything." His voice was tinged with a quiet desperation.“I need to find a way to fix this. I promise I'll come back. I'll make things right."

Lilly shook her head, the weight of his words sinking deep into her.“Is this your solution? Leaving? Is this how you plan to make amends?"

"I'm not running away, Lilly,” Peter said softly, stepping toward her, his hand outstretched. But Lilly stepped back, her eyes filled with fury and disappointment.

“Then what exactly are you doing?" she demanded, her voice rising.“What do you want from me?"

Peter's face contorted with emotion,but before he could speak, Lilly's words cut through him. “Leave. Just leave, I don't want to hear any more.” He hesitated, his eyes filled with anguish. "Lilly-” “Leave!" she shouted, her voice echoing in the quiet cemetery. He nodded, defeated, and turned away, his assistant following him with a look of sympathy for the broken family left behind.

Lilly stood frozen for a moment, the tears that had been building finally spilling over. Alexander was there in an instant, his arms enveloping her in a comforting embrace. "It's okay," he murmured softly. "I'm here for you. You don't need him."

Her tears didn't stop, but his words soothed the pain, if only a little.When she finally pulled back, she took the flowers from the bodyguards and made her way to her sisters' graves. The quiet whispers of the wind felt like a conversation with the lost. She placed the flowers carefully,whispering a prayer for their souls before she stood, a sense of closure washing over her.

Alexander stood beside her, their fingers entwined."How do you feel now?”he asked, his voice gentle.

Lilly closed her eyes,feeling a sense of peace she hadn't known in years. “
I feel like I can breathe again. Like the weight of the world is finally lifting.”

Alexander's lips curled into a smile, his gaze full of love. "Good. Because now we can focus on what really matters-our child and our life together."

Lilly's smile mirrored his. "I love you, Alexander," she whispered,her heart full.

"I love you too," he said, his voice thick with emotion.

She suddenly found the courage to ask what had been on her mind.“When did you start feelingthis way about me?"

“From the first day I saw you," Alexander replied, his tone unwavering. Lilly's eyes widened. "From the very first day?"

"Yes," he confirmed, a small, affectionate smile playing on his lips.“Ididn't know it then, but when your grandfather took you away, I almost lost my mind. That's when I knew."

Tears threatened to rise again, but this time, they were tears of happiness."I love you too. I always have."

And in that moment, everything felt right. The past was behind them, and the future-together-was all that mattered.


The bodyguards respectfully turned away, allowing the couple their moment of peace, as Lilly and Alexander shared a kiss, the promise of a future filled with love and a new life together.

 
************

THREE YEARS LATER.
###Chapter 59

**THREE YEARS LATER

The air inside the conference hall was thick with tension. A hundred executives sat at attention, their eyes trained on the man at the head of the table: Alexander Kane, the ruthless CEO of the Kane Corporation,whose reputation for being unforgiving and calculating was legendary acrosS Aurora City. He sat with unyielding authority, the sharp lines of his face betraying nothing of the storm brewing beneath his cold exterior.

A faint sound broke the oppressive silence-the gentle breathing of a child asleep on Alexander's shoulde. His three-year-old daughter, Viola,had become a fixture in these high-stakes meetings. Her presence was both a symbol of Alexander's complex. fiercely protective nature and an unspoken challenge to anyone daring enough to disrupt the sacred calm surrounding her.

Before the meeting had begun. Alexander had made one thing crystal clear to everyone present: *Not a single soul would dare disturb his daughter*.His directive had the effect of turning even the most seasoned executives into silent, sweating statues. Who else but Alexander Kane would bring his child to such an intense setting? And who else would fire an employee with a single word if their slightest mistake disturbed his daughter's peaceful slumber? It was a dangerous gamble, but in this room, no one dared question it. The presenter stood, voice shaky and slow,carefully pacing through his slides. His every word was weighed, measured, and scrutinized under the watchful gaze of the powerful men and women surrounding him. Every so often, his eyesflickered nervously toward the small figure nestled against her father's chest, her innocent face framed by her father's broad shoulder. But then it happened. A chair scraped back abruptly, its legs screeching as a director stood too quickly. The chaos that followed felt like a storm cracking through the silence-a loud crash as the chair tumbled to the ground.

The room went still.

Alexander's gaze flickered from the presentation on the screen to his daughter, whose small body stirred, the delicate sound of her whimpering filling the room. Viola rubbed her eyes with tiny fists, a frown forming as she looked up at her father, her innocent face contorted with confusion and distress.

Alexander's eyes narrowed. his lips pulling into a thin, implacable line. His voice, when it came, was ice-cold, cuttingthrough the tension with brutal finality.


"You're fired. Get out."

The words struck like a whip. The director's facedrained of color,panic flooding his chest as he scrambled for any shred of dignity. But there was no point. Alexander's word was law, and his punishment was swift. The man fled, leaving the room in stunned silence.

Viola,still tearful, clung to her father, her cries echoing softly in the sterile room. The air felt thick-charged, almost suffocating. Alexander's attention never wavered. His steely eyes remained fixed on the group of executives, all of them motioning to make their exit."What are you waiting for?" His voice was hard,leaving no room for negotiation. "Leave. Now." The remaining executives fled in a flurry of motion, the room emptied in moments. Only James remained, silently standing by the door, his eyes flickering between the father and the child.


Alexander moved with precision, his tone softening as he turned back to his daughter, his anger melting away. He gently wiped the tears from her cheeks, his hands tender as he comforted her.

"Shh... It's okay. Daddy's here. Stop crying now."

Viola's sobs slowly quieted, and her face softened into a contented pout.Alexander stood, cradling her against him, his arms protective and firm as he walked toward his office. James followed quietly behind them, the weight of the aborted meeting hanging over him.

As soon as the door to Alexander's office clicked shut. Alexander adjusted his daughter in his arms, the intensity of the meeting lingering in his eyes despite his apparent calm. His gaze shifted to James.

"What's the situation?" he asked, his tone authoritative but distracted by his daughter's innocent presence.

James hesitated,glancing at Viola. The project they had been discussing was urgent-critical. even-but at this moment, nothing seemed to matter more than the child nestled in Alexander's arms.

"The meeting we just canceled, sir... It was crucial. We need to submit the finalized project plan to the government by tomorrow." Viola's large eyes, innocent yet sharp, looked up at James, as if understanding the gravity of the situation. She'd been the cause of the disruption. yet her father's focus was unwavering. It was as if nothing could deter him from his commitments. Alexander nodded, still holding Viola close. "The project from the first presentation will suffice. Send that to thegovernment tomorrow."

James exhaled in relief. "Yes, sir. I'll make sure it gets done."

With the weight of the decision lifted, James stepped back, preparing to exit the office. Alexander's attention, however, was now entirely focused on his daughter, his icy demeanor melting in her presence.


Viola had barely settled on the couch before Alexander's voice broke the quiet again.

"You need to stay there for a while, alright?" he said gently, motioning to the couch where an array of treats awaited her.


Viola glanced at the treats, her small face scrunching in indecision. "Only if you promise to take me to the airport to pick up Mommy," she bargained,her voice sweet but filled with the kind of quiet power only a child could possess.


Alexander sighed, his resolve slipping just a little. "I already told you,you can't go-it's too late."

Her lip began to quiver, and tears pooled in her eyes. Alexander,despite himself, relented. "Alright, I'll take you."

Viola's face lit up with triumph, and she jumped into his arms. planting a kiss on his cheek. "Yay!" A rare, soft smile touched Alexander's lips as he kissed her forehead.He set her down gently and watched as she made her way to the couch,already excited by the promise of treats. For a moment, the office was still. The man who commanded millions,whose every decision rippled through the business world,was now lost in the simple joy of a child's smile.
As Viola munched happily on her snacks, Alexander turned back to his work. The documents on his desk were a mountain, demanding his attention, yet somehow, with Viola nearby, the burden seemed lighter. He was Alexander Kane-the cold,calculating CEO, a man of great power-but in this moment, he was just a father, quietly balancing the weight of the world with the weight of love.
###Chapter 60

Lilly's gaze drifted out of the airplane window as the city below grew larger, a smile slowly forming on her lips. After three long weeks of business travel, the familiar sight of home had never seemed so sweet. The time away had been grueling-not just for the work but for the ache of missing her family. She had left behind her little girl and her husband,Alexander, who had made it clear he wasn't happy about the length of her trip. The thought of seeing him again, of being in his arms, made her pulse quicken. But she was certain-now that she was back, he wouldn't let her take another trip like that again anytime soon.

As the airplane descended, her mind drifted back to their video call the day before. She couldn't help but chuckle at the memory of teasing him about not being able to come home today. His reaction had been instant-anger, sharp and clear. She'd had to quickly backpedal, trying to calm him.Then, in an attempt to keep the peace, he showed her their daughter,fast asleep in their bed, refusing to sleep alone because she didn't want the house to feel empty. It was an unspoken message of his own loneliness,one that made her heart ache.

The memory warmed her as shegazed out the window. She hated being away from them, but her role as the president of Blake Group had demanded it. Late nights, endless meetings, constant travel-life had become a whirlwind. But now, with the weight of the past few weeks behind her, she was determined to change things. Regular hours,more time for family-this was going to be her new normal. Stepping off the plane, Lilly was flanked by her assistant and her ever-present personal guard. She scanned the bustling crowd, her heart searching for the familiar, comforting sight of Alexander. "Mommy!" The high-pitched voice cut through the noise, and Lilly turned just in time to see her daughter barreling toward her, tiny legs carrying her with unrestrained excitement.

Lilly's heart swelled as she dropped her hand luggage, rushing to scoop up her little girl. "My baby, I missed you so much!" she exclaimed, lifting her daughter into her arms and spinning her around. Her laughter rang through the air, pure and unrestrained.


Her daughter beamed, touching Lilly's long blonde hair and planting a kiss on her cheek. "I missed you too, Mommy," she said, her voice a soft whisper.

"And I missed you, my darling," Lilly murmured, spinning her around once more, her laughter mixing with her daughter's. The unexpected joy of this reunion filled her to the brim, and she almost forgot everything else.


"But Daddy missed you more," her daughter added, with a knowing look in her eyes.

Lilly froze,her smile faltering as she glanced around. The crowd had gathered around them, snapping photos of the perfect family reunion, but something was missing. She didn't see Alexander anywhere.

"Where's Daddy?" she asked, her voice slipping with a hint of confusion.

"In the car," her daughter replied casually. A wave of discomfort washed over Lilly. He was waiting in the car? Not here to greet her himself? Her mind raced as she held her daughter close,trying to push down the unease that bubbled up inside her. What was going on? "Let's go," she said, forcing a smile for her daughter's sake, even as her mind churned with questions.

Her assistant had already collected her bags, and they moved quickly through the crowds, cameras flashing around them, but Lilly's focus remained on the missing presence of her husband.


Outside, several sleek black luxury cars stood in a neat line, drawing the attention of bystanders who couldn't help but admire the polished vehicles.But it was the first car that caught her eye-specifically, the man sitting inside,checking his watch with restless impatience.

Alexander.


He watched her approach, his expression guarded, his posture stiff. She couldn't read him. It had been a long three weeks, but his distance now-his decision to let their daughter come in to greet her while he stayed in the car-wasn't lost on her.


The moment she reached the car, she slid into the back seat, still holding her daughter in her arms. Alexander was silent beside her, his calm gaze meeting hers, but there was something in his eyes that made her pulse spike. He had been distant, and it didn't sit right with her.

She leaned her head on his chest, breathing in the scent of him,the familiar, comforting feeling of his presence. "I missed you," she murmured.lifting her face to meet his eyes, hoping for the reassurance she craved."Didn't you miss me?" His hand slid around her waist, pulling her closer. "I missed you so much,"he said, his voice low, before he kissed her deeply, passionately. It was everything she'd longed for during their time apart. And yet,something felt off, as if there were words left unspoken between them. Their kiss deepened, growing more urgent, until Alexander pulled back.his breath ragged. "If I kept kissing you like this, we'd make headlines again," he said, his voice rough with restraint.

Lilly's cheeks flushed, and she pouted playfully. "You didn't want to greet me?" she teased, still trying to piece together the odd distance between them.


Alexander's fingers ran through her hair, his gaze unreadable. "IfI had.we'd have ended up all over the tabloids by tomorrow morning," he replied with a half-smile. He was right. The last time they had shown affection publicly, the backlash had been swift and cruel. The internet had exploded with jealousy, and Lilly had been the target of hate-filled comments. Alexander had been furious, making sure those who insulted her paid the price.

Lilly leaned in, pressing a kiss to his lips, a suggestion lingering in the air."Then we can just keep it between us," she whispered,her voice hushed.

A knowing smile curled on his lips. "Agreed."

As the car rolled toward home, Lilly's mind continued to swirl with questions. Her daughter had fallen asleep by the time they reached the house. Lilly gently tucked her into bed, kissing her cheek before leaving the room. But when she entered their master bedroom, Alexander was nowhere to be found. His study, she knew, was where he'd be. Seizing the opportunity for a moment of peace, she decided to indulge in a warm bath. The soothing water relaxed her muscles, and before she knew it, she'd drifted off to sleep. When she woke, she found herself in bed, Alexander's arms wrapped tightly around her. The softness of his embrace was comforting, but his stillness only raised more questions.

The next morning, Lilly found herself staring at her reflection, shock running through her at the marks on her neck. Her fingers traced them.her mind running wild. What had happened during the night?

As she turned to face him, Alexander's smug smile said everything.

"Isn't it beautiful?" he asked, his voice dripping with satisfaction.

Lilly opened her mouth to protest but closed it, speechless. Instead,she sighed, wondering where her plans for the day would fit in with Alexander's ever-present control.

"Where are you going?" he asked, his tone more commanding than curious.
"You're not working today. You'll stay home and be a good wife."

Lilly turned to help him with his tie, her fingers brushing against his chest.
"I'll pick Viola up from school, then take her to see Grandma," she replied,a smile tugging at her lips.


Alexander studied her for a moment before speaking, his eyes dark with something she couldn't quite place. "Make sure you're both back by 7 p.m.



The weight in his voice had her pause. Why the insistence on an early return? But she nodded, hoping it was nothing more than a father's protective instincts. As he kissed her forehead and left the room, Lilly's thoughts lingered on his words. There was something he wasn't telling her-something beneath the surface. And she intended to find out what it was.
###Chapter 61

The teacher held young Viola's hand, who hopped excitedly as they made their way to the parking lot where parents waited in their cars to pick up their children from school. Unlike most kids who were greeted by at least one parent. Viola was always met by her nanny and two bodyguards due to her parents' busy schedules. The entire school knew who her parents were and understood why they couldn't pick her up themselves.


Mrs. Hannah, the middle-aged school teacher, walked Viola to the familiar car that always arrived to collect her. The car door opened, and instead of the nanny stepping out as expected, Viola's mother emerged. Viola's eyes widened in surprise, and she released her teacher's hand, running toward her mother.


Lilly bent down and opened her arms wide to embrace her daughter.


“Mommy!”

Lilly hugged her tightly and kissed her cheek. "Happy to see Mommy?"Viola nodded enthusiastically, bouncing in her mother's arms, overjoyed that her mother had come to pick her up.

Lilly stood up, holding her daughter, and turned to the teacher."Hello,Mrs. Hannah," she said, bowing her head respectfully.

Seeing such a high-profile woman bow to her made Mrs. Hannah feel uncomfortable; she felt it shouId be the other way around, especially since Lilly was the child's parent.

“Good afternoon, Mrs. Blake," Mrs. Hannah replied, bowing and smiling.

"Thank you for being such a good teacher and for always looking after Viola." Even though she didn't pick Viola up personally,she always received reports from the nanny and bodyguards about how the teacher took care of her daughter.


"It's nothing; as her teacher, it is my duty to look after her."

"Thank you," Lilly repeated, bowing again.


Other parents who had come to collect their children watched Lilly with interest. They were aware of her influential status, not just as Alexander Blake's wife but also as the president and future heir of the Blake empire.

The school catered to the elite, but there was always a hierarchy,with some wealthy families outshining others. Many mothers saw this as an opportunity to gain Lilly's favor and instructed their children to befriend Viola, hoping it would bring them closer to Lilly.


After a brief conversation with the teacher, Lilly got into the car with Viola.who waved goodbye to Mrs. Hannah.

"How was school today? Did you make any new friends?" Lilly asked as the car drove away from the school.

"School was fine, but I didn't make any new friends."

“Why not?” “Because they only want to be friends because their parents told them to."Viola looked at her mother, seeing her confused expression. "What do you mean?” "Their mothers want to be close to you, so they tell their kids to be friends with me," Viola explained, recalling what a classmate had told her. Lilly nodded, now understanding. "Then just be friends with those who truly want to be your friend."

Viola smiled and nodded. "I have two real friends."

Lilly knew who her daughter meant, as she was close to their parents as well. It seemed Viola was content with having a few genuine friends instead of many superficial ones.

"What do you want to eat,sweetheart?"

"I want chicken," Viola said,her mouth watering at the thought.

Lilly smiled; her daughter loved chicken. “Alright, we'll get some chicken and other things, then head to great-grandma's place."

"Yay, I want to see great-grandma!" Viola exclaimed excitedly.

Lilly laughed at her daughter's enthusiasm.

Old Mrs. Blake had two reasons to be thankful: first, that Alexander had learned to love Lilly and remained married to her; and second,that she had lived long enough to experience being a great-grandmother.Viola,at just three years old, was already displaying remarkable intelligence.something she had inherited from her parents.

Mrs. Blake stood smiling as Viola ran toward her and hugged her legs.

“Great-grandma, I missed you!" "And I missed you too, my smart girl.” Viola blushed; she loved it when her great-grandmother called her smart.While others called her cute, her great-grandmother always praised her intelligence. "Have you eaten?"

"No,but we bought chicken."

"Your favorite!"

Viola nodded."Yes."

"Alright. let's go inside. I also had something made for you to eat with the chicken."


Viola took her great-grandmother's hand, and they walked inside together.

Lilly followed behind, smiling. It always amazed her how Viola seemed to forget about her and Alexander whenever she was with her great-grandparents.


As they stepped into the house, the aroma of freshly baked bread and roasted vegetables wafted through the air. The mansion, grand and elegant,was filled with the warmth of family memories and the charm of old-world sophistication. Viola's eyes sparkled as she looked around,remembering the many happy moments she had spent there.


“Great-grandma, can we go to the garden after lunch?" Viola asked, her eyes pleading.


"Of course, my dear. We can pick some flowers for your mommy," Mrs.Blake replied, her face lighting up with a smile. Lilly watched the exchange with a heart full of love. Seeing her daughter bond so deeply with her great-grandmother made all the sacrifices she and Alexander made worth it. She knew they were building a legacy of love and strength that would carry through generations. They settled at the dining table, which was adorned with a beautiful lace tablecloth and fine china. The house staff had outdone themselves.preparing a feast fit for royalty. Besides the chicken that Viola loved.there were mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables, and a variety of salads.

"Let's wash our hands first," Lilly reminded Viola, leading her to the sink.They washed up quickly and returned to the table, where Mrs. Blake was already seated.


The meal was a joyous affair, filled with laughter and stories. Viola shared tales from school. talking about her two close friends and the various activities they enjoyed together. Lilly and Mrs. Blake listened attentively,encouraging her with smiles and nods.


After lunch, they made their way to the garden. The Blake family garden was a sprawling expanse of greenery, with vibrant flowers,towering trees.and well-manicured lawns. Viola ran ahead, her laughter echoing through the space as she chased butterflies and picked flowers.

Lilly and Mrs. Blakestrolled behind her, their pace leisurely. "She really is a smart girl," Mrs. Blake said, watching Viola with pride. “You and Alexander have done a wonderful job.”

"Thank you, Grandma. We try our best. It's not always easy with our busy schedules, but we make sure to spend quality time with her whenever we can,”Lilly replied.

“You're doing just fine. Family is what matters most, and you're showing her that every day," Mrs. Blake reassured her.

They spent the afternoon in the garden, basking in the sunshine and the joy of being together. Viola's infectious energy and enthusiasm brought life to every corner of the garden. She made flower crowns, picked bouquets, and even attempted to climb a small tree, much to Lilly's amusement and mild alarm.


"Be careful, darling!" Lilly called out, laughing as Viola wobbled but managed to balance herself.


"I'm okay, Mommy!" Viola replied, her face flushed with excitement.

As the afternoon turned to evening, they decided it was time to head back home. Viola, now tired from all the running and playing, held her mother's hand as they walked back to the car.


"Did you have a good time, sweetheart?" Lilly asked,smoothing her daughter's hair.

"The best time ever, Mommy! I love spending time with you and great-grandma." Viola replied, her eyes shining with happiness.

Back in the car, Viola quickly fell asleep, exhausted from her day of fun.Lilly looked at her daughter's peaceful face and felt a deep sense of contentment. Despite the challenges and demands of her career,moments like these made everything worthwhile.

As they drove back, Lilly reflected on the balance she and Alexander had found between their professional lives and their roles as parents. It wasn't always perfect, but they had created a supportive environment for Viola,filled witha love and security.
###Chapter 62

Sandra had spent a year and six months in a coma and underwent therapy to make a full recovery. Now, after an additional year and a few months, her life had returned to normal. She was no longer the reckless girl who loved to overspend and was irresponsible. The accident and long coma had completely transformed her, and she now held a position in the family company and had been entrusted with her inheritance by Alexander,who recognized how much she had changed.


Sandra walked into the house and was greeted by Camila.

"Welcome, Miss Sandra," Camila said with a respectful bow.

"Thank you. Camila. Do we have guests?" she asked, noticing the noise coming from the dining area.


"Yes,your sister-in-law and niece are visiting."

"Is my sister-in-law back?"

Camila nodded.

Sandra smiled and headed to the dining area. She found three people at the table, enjoying a late lunch. Little Viola was busy devouring chicken.

Sandra smiled at her niece's cuteness, knowing how much she loved chicken. "Look who's back," Sandra said, hugging Lilly from behind. "I missed you.sister-in-law." Lilly smiled warmly. "I missed you too. Come, sit," she said, patting the seat next to her. Sandra greeted her grandmother, then went over to kiss Viola on the cheek."Hey,cutie,how was school?"


Viola shook her head, indicating her mouth was full of chicken, a sign she couldn't talk. Her mother had taught her not to speak while eating. and she was trying to be obedient.


Sandra laughed and kissed her forehead before sitting next to Lilly.

"How was your trip,sister-in-law?"

"It went well. By the way, how many times have I told you to call me Lilly?" Lilly felt slightly offended that Sandra always referred to her as sister-in-law despite their close relationship.

Sandra shook her head. "I can't call you by your name. Alexander insists on the utmost respect for you, and not calling you by your name is part of that."


Lilly laughed. "He won't mind; I'll talk to him."

"He's made it clear that if I callyou by your name, he'll tell Viola to stop calling me aunty," Sandra said, making Lilly sigh. Alexander could be quite petty sometimes. "I'll talk to him about that."

"Okay,if you say so."

Grandma Helen, who had been listening, smiled. "Have you had lunch?"she asked, knowing Sandra often skipped meals. "I had a snack, Grandma." "A snack is not a proper meal." "I'll just eat dinner later." "No,have somnething to eat now," Grandma Helen insisted, starting to fill a plate for her.

"No,Grandma, if I eat now. I'll have to skip dinner since it's already 5 p.m."


"Fine, but I know you plan to skip dinner even if you don't eat now. So,eat up." Grandma Helen instructed.

Sandra sighedand nodded. "Okay, Grandma."

Lilly smiled, then glanced at her daughter, whose face was oily from the chicken. Viola had pushed away all the vegetables on her plate and focused solely on the chicken, which Lilly had deboned to make it easier for her to eat.


Seeing this, Lilly sighed tiredly. No wonder her father had reduced the number of chickens Viola ate to encourage her to eat more vegetables. Now,
she regretted buying the chicken.

"Sweetheart," Lilly called.

Viola looked up and smiled at her mother.

"You're not eating the vegetables," Lilly pointed out.


Viola glanced at her plate and realized she had indeed ignored the vegetables. She blinked and looked up at her mother. "Eat the vegetables, or no more chicken for a whole month." Viola's eyes filled with tears. "Noooo." "I'm serious, Viola." She pouted and looked sadly at the chicken in her hand before putting it down and starting to eat the vegetables.

Grandma Helen patted her head and smiled at her obedience. "Good girl."she praised her great-granddaughter.


"When is your grandfather's birthday again?"

"Next Saturday,Grandma."

"And you haven't started preparations?"

"Preparations have already started. Grandfather has people handling it. It's his 80th birthday, and he wants it to be grand. He says I'm too busy with the company to handle the preparations myself. I insisted, but he refused."


"But you're still going to get him a gift, right?"


"I already did. I got something for him when I traveled. He's going to love it."


"Good,good." Grandma Helen said.

After spending another couple of hours with Grandma Helen and Sandra.Lilly and Viola headed home before it got too late. When they arrived, Alexander received a text from his men confirming their safe arrival. He put down his phone and dialed a number. The person on the other end answered on the first ring."Do whatever it takes to ensure she stays in prison," Alexander said before hanging up after gettíng a response. "Really? Again?" Richard sighed. Alexander shot him a cold look.

"Don't you think she's suffered enough? She's already paid for her crimes.
1

"Richard is right. It's enough. Stop extending her sentence. The court sentenced her to 15 years, and she's served that. She should have been released three years ago, but you extended it by three years, and now you want to add more?" Ethan said.


Alexander ignored them, continuing with his paperwork.

"Are you seriously working now? We're supposed to be having drinks and catching up," Ethan said, but Alexander paid no attention.


"She's your mother," Richard said, which was enough to make Alexander leave what he was doing and charge towards Richard.


In a flash, Alexander grabbed Richard by the collar and punched him,sending him to the ground. Ethan and Richard were taken aback by the speed and force of the attack.


Richard touched his lip; which was bleeding. The look on Alexander's face was so dark that Richard, usually unafraid, felt a pang of fear. He had made the mistake of referring to her as Alexander's mother, knowing fully well how much he despised that. "Say it again, and see what happens," Alexander warned, staring into his eyes. Richard got up and rolled up his sleeve."We might as well settle this.Whether you like it or not, you need to hear the truth." Sensing what was about to happen and who would likely get hurt, Ethan stepped in front of Alexander, whose fist was already clenched.

"Please. Alexander, let it go." Ethan pleaded. They had come to hang out.not fight.


"Not until he knows not to repeat himself." Alexander's cold voice rang out.
###Chapter 63

It was 10 pm, and Alexander still hadn't returned home. Lilly,growing increasingly worried, tried calling him twice, but he didn't answer. This was unusual, as Alexander typically picked up her calls immediately. She recalled him menationing he would be hanging out with Richard and Ethan,so she decided to give Ethan a call. After the first ring. he picked up.

"Lilly?" he answered, his voice slightly strained.

"Hi, Ethan. Is Alexander with you? He's not answering his phone," Lilly inquired. anxiety lacing her tone.


Ethan, standing outside Sophia's office,glanced towards Alexander,who was sitting nearby. He wasn't sure how to tell Lilly that Alexander and Richard had a fight, resulting in Richard being hospitalized. He took a deep breath, trying to keep his voice steady.


"He's fine and will be home soon..."

Before he could finish, Sophia took the phone from his hand, her face stern and concerned.


"Sophia? What's going on?" Lilly asked, her worry escalating.

Sophia gave Ethan a cold look before walking away to speak privately with Lilly.


"Hello? Hello, Ethan?" Lilly's voice quivered on the other end. "It's me, Sophia," "Sophia, did something happen?" Lilly's heart raced. "Yes,something did."

Sophia's voice carried an edge of frustration and concern. Lilly stood up from the couch, her mind racing. "Is Alexander okay? What's going on?"she pressed.


"Alexander and my husband fought, and they're both in the hospital right now," Sophia revealed.


Sophia and Richard had married two years ago and now had a toddler named Theo.


"What? Why? Are they badly hurt?" Lilly asked. panic setting in.

"Richard is."

Lilly could hear the pain in Sophia's voice. "I'm coming over," she said,hanging up quickly. She changed out of her nightclothes and hurried out of the room. She checked on Viola, who was sound asleep, before heading downstairs.


"Ma'am, are you going somewhere?" Clara asked, noticing Lilly's hurried pace.

"Yes. Clara. Please look after Viola. I'm going to the hospital and will be back."


"Is everything alright, ma'am?" Clara asked, concern evident in her voice. "I'll explain when I return, Clara," Lilly replied, rushing out the door. Clara nodded,worried but not pressing further. The fact that Alexander wasn't home yet only added to her concern. "Ma'amn, where are you headed at this hour? The boss instructed you not to leave the house at night." Pedro said, seeing her step out.

"He's in the hospital, Pedro. Take me there now," Lilly instructed firmly.

"The boss is in the hospital?" Pedro asked, surprised.

"Yes,now get the car," Lilly insisted.

Pedro nodded and quickly fetched a bulletproof Audi from the garage. He drove her to the hospital without delay.

Upon arriving, Lilly took the elevator to Sophia's floor. As she approached Sophia's office, she saw Alexander sitting on a bench with a bandaged hand.


"Alexander!" she exclaimed, rushing towards him. She hugged him tightly,inspecting him for injuries. Aside from his bandaged hand, he seemed relatively unscathed. This meant Richard must be the one badly hurt.What had happened?

"What are you doing here?" Alexander asked, his voice tinged with frustration.


"Why did you and Richard fight? Sophia said you two fought. I've never seen you fight before," Lilly questioned, concern evident in her eyes.

"Why didn't you just caIl instead of coming here?" Alexander retorted.

"I gave you two missed calls. Why didn't you pick up?" Lilly countered Alexander stared at her in silence for a moment, then stood up, pulling her along with him. "Let's go home," he said curtly. "I need to see Richard first," Lilly insisted, trying to walk away,but he held her back. Sophia will take care of him. Let's go." Alexander replied.

Lilly pulled her hand free and walked into Sophia's office. She saw Sophia tending to Richard, who was severely injured. Unlike Alexander, Richard was in bad shape.


"Richard," Lilly said softly,approaching them.

Sophia turned to her, her expression softening. "Lilly, you're here."

"How did this happen?" Lilly asked.her voice trembling.

"Didn't Alexander tell you?" Sophia asked,surprised.

"He didn't explain why you both fought," Lilly replied, glancing at Richard.

Richard sighed deeply. "Wait until he tells you himself," he said, indicating it wasn't his place to explain.


"Alexander is still angry, so you'd better take him home. I don't want another fight," Sophia advised seriously.


Lilly nodded. "Get well soon, Richard," she said, turning to leave.Whatever had caused Alexander to fight Richard so fiercely, it must have been significant.


Outside the office, she found Alexander waiting. She looked at him briefly before walking past him towards the elevator. She heard his footsteps behind her, indicating he was following. As the elevator doors opened, Ethan stepped out. "Lilly, you came," he said, about to say more but stopping when he saw Alexander. "Good night, you two," Ethan said, walking past them. Lilly entered the elevator, followed by Alexander. They rode in silence.


Reaching the uinderground garage, Lilly got into the back seat of Alexander's car. He joined her, instructing the chauffeur to drive home. Pedro followed in the car he had driven Lily in.


Lilly glanced at Alexander's bandaged wrist and sighed, feeling a mix of frustration and concern. She looked at his face, noting the calm demeanor that replaced his earlier anger.


"What happened?" she asked again. "Richard is in a bad shape. Why would you fight him?"

"Friends quarrel," Alexander replied shortly.

"What kind of quarrel leads to this. Alexander?" Lilly pressed.

"You don't need to know," he snapped.

"I don't need to know?" Lilly repeated,disbelief in her voice.

"Yes," he said firmly.

"Fine," Lilly said, turning to look out the window, ignoring him.

Alexander watched her until they arrived home. She stepped out and headed upstairs to their room.


She changed into her nightclothes and fouand Alexander in the room.Ignoring him, she triedI to pass, but he pulled her back. "What?" she asked,exasperated. "Don't be like this," Alexander pleaded. "Why not, when you're keeping things from me?" she retorted.

"Things?" he asked,feigning ignorance.

"I know there's a serious reason you fought Richard, but you won't tell me.
What's wrong?" she pressed, searching his eyes for answers.

Alexander remained silent, and Lilly pulled away again.

"Are you really going to bed angry?" he asked.

"Yes, if that's what you want," she replied.

He sighed. "It was a friend's quarrel. We'll sort it out."

Realizing it was futile, Lilly gave up. "I'll sleep now. I have work tomorrow."


Alexander left the room,and Lilly sighed tiredly.

The next morning. Lilly woke up to find Alexander cuddling her.She stared at his peaceful face, then remembered the previous night. Thinking of Richard's injuries, she grew angry again.

Lilly traced his face with her hand, waking him. He smiled. "Good morning."


"Mm," she responded, still upset.

"No good morning for me?" he asked,teasing. "No," she  replied,firm. He kissed her. "But I can get a kiss." "Stolen kiss," she said, trying to get up, but he tightened his hold. "Where are you going?" he asked.


"Work,"she replied.

"It's Saturday," he reminded her.

"I work on Saturdays, and so do you," she said, matter-of-factly.


"Not today. We're spending it with Viola," he declared.

She wanted to. but she had an uargent meeting with her grandfather."There's a meeting. Grandfather will be there."

"Postpone it." Alexander insisted.

"I can't," she argued.

"You will," he said firmly.

Alexander was determined to spend the day with his family,meeting or not.
###Chapter 64

"What do you mean the meeting was called off?" Caleb shouted,his voice echoing through the office. His face was flushed with anger as he glared at Lilly's assistant, who had just come to inform him that the crucial meeting he had traveled for was abruptly canceled. Caleb had meticulously planned his schedule around this important meeting, and now he was being told it wasn't happening.

"My granddaughter wouldn't cancel such an important gathering without a valid reason!" he exclaimed, frustration evident in his tone.

"Sir.,, sir, it was her husband, Mr. Kane, who called off the meeting on her behalf." Karina, Lilly's assistant, stammered, her voice quivering under Caleb's intense scrutiny. She could feel the weight of his disappointment and anger.

"Alexander did what?" Calet's eyes widened with disbelief.

"Yes,sir. He called and canceled the mesting" Karina repeated, her hands trembling slightly as she held onto her clipboard.

Caleb clenched his teeth, his jaw tightening as he processed this information."Hand me my phone. Victor," he commanded sharply.turning to his loyal aide who stood meudby.  Victor promptly handed over the cell phone, sensing the urgency in Caleb's demand. Caleb dialed Lilly's number with quick, precise movements.Alexander was already exerting control over every aspect of her life. Why did he feel the need to interfere with her professional responsibilities too?The phone rang for a few seconds before someone picked up. "Lilly." Caleb began, his voice stem. "It's Alexander" came the calm response from the other end of the line.

Caleb pulled the phone away from his ear,double-checking the number on the screen to ensure he had dialed correctly. Frowning, he placed the phone back to his ear. "Hand the phone to Lilly.What gives you the right to answer her calls?" he demanded angrily,furious that Alexander had the audacity to pick up when he saw it was her grandfather calling.

“Because I'm her husband, and what's hers is mine." Alexander said calmly, his gaze fixed on Lilly, who was sleeping peacefully beside him. He spoke softly to avoid waking her,his tone steady and unflappable.

Caleb's grip tightened on the phone, his knuckles turning white."Give her the phone this instant!" he shouted, his patience wearing thin.

“I can't." Alexander replied, his voice still calm.

“What did you just say?” Caleb's voice rose in incredulity. The young man was pushing all his buttons, and he regretted not ensuring they divorced when he had the chance.

"She is sleeping,” Alexander explained, glancing again at the sleeping Lilly.his expression softening as he watched her.

"Sleeping?" Caleb could hardly believe what he was hearing."Victor,what time is it?”


"10 am,sir," Victor responded promptly. “10 am,and she is still asleep?" Caleb's voice was filled with disbelief and irritation. “Yes, grandfather-in-law," Alexander replied, maintaining his calm demeanor. “Mygranddaughter wouldn't be sleeping at this hour. You must have done something to her."Caleb accused, his mind racing with suspicions.

Alexander looked at the sleeping Lilly again, tracingthe faint marks he had left on her neck earlier that morning. If making love to his wife and leaving her exhausted was the same thing as drugging her, then he would gladly continue to do so, he thought wryly.

"So now you're silent, you insolent young man!" Caleb shouted."Mark my words, she will leave you once her feelings for you fade." he threatened.His granddaughter didn't need him; she was an heiress with her own strength and independence.

Alexander's face darkened at the statement. He hadn't wanted to marry or have a child due to past experiences, but after finding and loving Lilly,he couldn't imagine letting her go. If she ever tried to leave him,he would never allow it and would rather keep her confined at home.


“And you think I will just let her go?" Alexander asked, his voice filled with quiet determination.


"We'll see about that. Meanwhile, I want to know why you canceled her meeting. What right do you have?" Caleb demanded, his voice regaining its authoritative tone.


"I canceled it on her behalf because she's not coming to the office today.You took her away from me and our daughter for three weeks to secure an international contract. Now, I want to spend the weekend with my family," Alexander explained, his voice firm yet calm.


For the first time, Caleb was speechless, He had indeed separated the family for three weeks, leaving his great-granddaughter without a mother.It was only right for them to spend the weekend together. Caleb cleared his throat, attempting to regain his composure. "Don't you dare answer her phone again if I call. I will make sure she leaves you," he threatened before abruptly hanging up.

Alexander stared at the phone with a cold expression, then turned his gaze to Lilly. "Are you planning to leave me?" he whispered softly, though he already knew the answer in his heart.

***

"Daddy!” Viola called out, her tiny voice filled with excitement as she stood up from where she was playing with her toys and ran towards her father.


Alexander picked her up and hugged her tightly. "What were you doing.my little one?" he asked, his voice gentle.

"Playing with my toys," she replied, her eyes sparkling with joy.

The nannies discreetly left the father and daughter alone in the room.sensing they needed some private time together.

"Is there something else you want to do besides playing with your toys?”Alexander inquired, a smile playing on his lips.

"Yes,”Viola nodded eagerly.

"What is it?" he asked, curious about her answer. "I want to play with Daddy," she said, her tiny hands gripping his shirt.“But don't you have work today?" she asked, her concern evident in her voice. Alexander smiled at her sweetness and thoughtfulness. "Daddy and Mommy don't have work today, so you have us both to yourself.”

She placed her little hands on his cheeks, looking into his eyes.“Really?”she asked, excitement bubbling in her voice.


"Yes," he confirmed, his heart melting at her innocence.

“Yay!”Viola cheered, clapping her hands.


Alexander couldn't help but smile at her joy. “But where is Mommy?"she asked,glancing towards the door.


"She's still sleeping," he explained, adjusting her slightly in his arms.

“Okay. I want to go shopping with Mommy when she wakes up," Viola announced with determination.


"Shopping?” Alexander echoed, surprised by her request.

She nodded enthusiastically. “Yes, Daddy. It's great-grandfather's birthday next week, and I haven't gotten him a gift yet. He'll be unhappy if I don't get him something.”


Sometimes, Alexander forgot how young his daughter was because she often acted so mature. Her awareness of such things at her age amazed him,but he loved how smart and thoughtful she was.


"My good girl," he said, stroking her hair gently. "So, what game do you want Daddy to play with you?" She thought for a moment, her eyes lighting up. "I want you to bake with me.” “But that's not a game,” he said, taken aback by her request.“Yes, but it's what I want to do," she insisted, her eyes shining with excitement.


“Baking?" Alexander was surprised. He hadn't expected that.

"Yes, Daddy. I want you to teach me how to bake. There are many things I want us to make together."


Alexander doubted his baking skills; the last time he baked was in high school for a project. But for his daughter, he was willing to try anything.

"Alright, baking it is,” he said, smiling at her.


“Yay!” Viola cheered again, hugging him tightly.

“Let's go to the kitchen then,” Alexander suggested, carrying her towards the kitchen.


As they entered the kitchen, Viola's eyes widened with excitement
###Chapter 65

Before long, the father-daughter duo had commandeered the entire kitchen for their baking session. Viola would occasionally leap up in joy as she learned something new. Recently, her school had organized a field trip to a bakery where her class saw how various cookies and pastries were made,sparking her fascination and a vow to learn how to bake.


She perched on a kitchen counter, well away from the oven and stove,as her father had insisted she keep a safe distance. She observed with keen interest as he gathered all the baking supplies they wvould need. Outside the kitchen, the chefs, some maids, and Clara peeked through a small gap in the door, watching their employer take on a role they had never imagined for him. It was a stunning sight-one of the city's most influential businessmen in an apron, ready to bake. No one would have believed it if they hadn't seen it themselves. They hadn't even expected him to marry or become a father. Seeing how he catered to the wishes of his wife and daughter showed them that even the toughest hearts could soften for loved ones.


They stayed outside, concerned that a mishap in the kitchen could lead to a fire, ready to step in if necessary. After watching several videos on how to bake cookies and a cake, Alexander began preparing.

“Daddy,"Viola's voice called out.

Alexander looked at her, smiling. He noticed her dissatisfied pout.“What is it,sweetheart?""How can I learn if all I do is sit here and watch?" she pouted again. “Oh, you're right," Alexander acknowledged, glancing at the items he had set out on the long kitchen island. "P'll move everything closer to you." He carefully relocated the ingredients and tools within her reach while ensuring she remained safe.


“I want to make cookies too," she declared.

He put an apron on her and kissed her forehead. "Alright. let's bake some cookies together," he said, grinning. He gathered all the necessary ingredients and placed themon the counter beside her. She eyed the array of ingredients with excitement. With Alexander's guidance, she started measuring flour and sugar, pouring them into a mixing bowl with precision. Alexander watched with pride as she added the ingredients,her face lighting up as the dough began to form. He handed her a bag of chocolate chips, which she eagerly sprinkled into the dough with practiced ease.


Once they finished preparing the cookies, Alexander placed them in the oven."We need to wait for them to bake. Meanwhile, let's start on the cake.”he suggested.


“Yay!" Viola jumped up, brimming with excitement.

Alexander arranged the ingredients for the cake on the counter,smiling at her eagerness. “Alright, Viola," he said, placing the recipe next to the ingredients. “Let's follow the steps carefully to make the most delicious cake."He read through the recipe with her, ensuring they understood each step. Viola nodded eagerly, her eyes fixed on the instructions. She instinctively reached for the mixing bowl, ready to dive into the baking process.Outside the kitchen, the staff continued to watch through the door,marveling at the ease with which father and daughter were baking.“At least they seem to be doing it right," one of them commented, and the others nodded in agreement. "I didn't think Mr. Kane had such skills." "What's going on here, and what skill are you talking about?" a familiar voice interrupted, causing them to jump in fright. "Ma'am!" they exclaimed in unison.

Lilly looked at them, puzzled. "Why are you all standing here peeking into the kitchen? Care to explain, Clara?"

She couldn't fathom why they were spying, including the chef. She had woken up and decided to come down for a glass of water and check on Viola when she found them like this. The aroma wafting from the kitchen had caught her attention.

“Ma'am, it's sir and Miss Viola in the kitchen baking, so we're just staying alert in case something goes wrong," Clara explained sincerely.

“Baking?”Lilly was taken aback. Alexander, baking?

They nodded.

"Let me see," Lilly said.

They stepped aside to let her through. Lilly opened the door slightly and peeked inside. There, in front of her eyes, were Alexander and Viola baking together, laughing and smiling.

Lilly was astonished, her mouth agape at the sight of her husband baking.It was a beautiful moment, seeing father and daughter bond. She turned to the staff.“Does anyone have their phone with them?"

"Yes, ma'am," Clara handed her phone to Lilly. "Turn on the camera," Lilly instructed. Clara activated the camera, and Lilly took several photos of Alexander and Viola baking from different angles. Handing the phone back, she said,“Thanks, Clara. Please send these to me later."


“Okay, ma'am,” Clara replied.

"Everyone can leave now," Lilly said.

The staff sighed in relief and dispersed after bowing their heads. Lilly fully opened the kitchen door and walked in.

"I thought I said no one should come in here," Alexander's voice, now cold,greeted her. He was adding the final touches to the cake batter when he heard the door open.


Viola turned and beamed when she saw her mother.“Mommy's awake!”She wanted to jump down to hnug her but realized she couldn't reach the floor.


Alexander looked up and smiled upon seeing Lilly.

Lilly walked over and kissed Viola. “Sweetie, you're covered in baking stuff.”

"Yes,because I'm learning to bake!" Viola exclaimed.

"How adorable," Lilly said,making her daughter smile.

“Mommy,"Viola called.

“Yes,darling?” "I want us to go shopping later." “Shopping?”Lilly asked. Viola nodded. "I need to get something for great-grandpa for his birthday next week."


“That's so thoughtful of you,sweetheart."


"So, are we going after we finish baking?" Viola asked,eyes wide with hope.


"Yes, darling, we'll go shopping after," Lilly promised.

“Yay!”Viola cheered.

"You joined us to bake?" Alexander asked.

"I came for water and saw you two baking. I had no idea you had such skills," Lilly said to Alexander.

He moved closer and kissed her lips. "I have many skills you don't know about.”


Lilly blushed.


Viola smiled as she watched her parents' affectionate moment. The family of three continued to enjoy their time together, baking happily.
###Chapter 66

one Week Later


Caleb Blake's 80th Birthday celebration, The Blake mansion bustled with activity as the staff hurriedly prepared for the evening's event. By 5 p.m.,reporters had already gathered outside the grand estate, eager to capture the arrival of the first guests for the party starting at 7 p.m. They wanted to be ahead of schedule to catch all the important arrivals.

"Isn't that Mrs. Kane's car coming?" asked a reporter from Aurora news Daily, turning to his senior colleague as a car approached the imposing gate.


"Yes, that's her vehicle," confirmed the senior reporter. Immediately,cameras were raised, and recording began.


"It's 5:20 p.m., and Lilly Kane has just arrived at the Blake residence for her grandfather's birthday celebration. We can also see her daughter,little Viola, accompanying her," narrated the cameraman as he filmed the luxury car driving through the gates.


"We'll go live again once more guests start arriving," the reporter concluded, noticing his colleagues' stunned expressions. "What's with the look?" he asked.


"You referred to her as Lilly Blake," one of them pointed out.


"Isn't that her name?" the puzzled junior reporter asked, only to be reprimanded. "How could you call her Lilly Blake! Do you understand the trouble you've just caused?" the senior reporter exclaimed. The junior reporter, now visibly worried, stammered, "But isn't she a Blake?"


"Are you an idiot? Do you not know whose wife she is? Didn't you read the brief I gave you? Being new doesn't excuse such a blunder!"

Realizing his mistake, the junior reporter pleaded, "I'm sorry, sír. I promise it won't happen again." He knew he should have referred to her as Lilly Kane or Mrs. Kane, acknowledging her marriage to Aleander Kane.


"Leave now and prepare for your dismissal. I'm certain Mr. Kane is already taking action," the senior reporter stated sternly.

Desperate, the junior reporter fell to his knees, clutching his superior's legs."Please, sir, help me. Explain to the superiors that I'm new and didn't know better. Please, sir," he begged, fearing the loss of his recently acquired job.


The senior reporter sighed. "There's nothing I can do. You could try pleading with Mr. Kane, but good luck finding another job. And just so you know, I'll face repercussions for your mistake too," he said before walking away.


The junior reporter began to sweat, understanding the immense power and influence Oliver Kane wielded over the city, even though he didn't own the news outlet.


Meanwhile, Alexander, who had watched the live report, was livid. He immediately summoned his assistant. "You called for me, sir?" James entered the office promptly. "Did you see the news?" "Yes, sir. I've already addressed it." James responded, bracing himself.

Oliver's eyes narrowed. "How did you handle it?"

"The reporter responsible will be dismissed soon,sir," James explained.

"Good," Alexander replied, his voice icy. He detested hearing his wife referred to by her maiden name, insisting she be recognized as a Kane.

"When is the last meeting scheduled?" he asked.

"At 6 p.m., sir. It will end by 7 p.m., giving you time to attend the banquet," James reported, handing over the business brief.

"Thank you. You may leave," Oliver said, glancing at the document.

James bowed and exited the room.

Back at the Blake estate, Lilly stepped out of the car, carrying her sleeping daughter. "Welcome, ma'am," greeted the head maid, Janet.

"Thank you, Miss Janet," Lilly replied with a smile, observing the hive of activity around her.

"Would you like something to eat or drink, ma'am?" Janet offered.

"No, we ate already. You can continue with your tasks. I'll join you after I settle her upstairs," Lilly said, looking at her daughter fondly.

Janet smiled, "She's adorable, even while sleeping."

Lilly nodded,"Yes,she is." Janet then excused herself to continue her work, while Lilly took Viola upstairs to her old room, which had already been prepared. She laid her daughter on the spacious bed and ensured she was comfortable before checking that all their belongings had been brought up. After confirming everything, she instructed the guards outside the room to ensure no one entered.


Making her way to her grandfather's study, she knocked and entered upon his invitation. "Happy 80th birthday, Grandpa!" she greeted warmly,hugging him.


"My dear," Caleb embraced her, patting her back.


"I have a special gift for you, Grandpa. I think you'll love it," she said,handing him a file.

Curious, Caleb opened the file to find a property deed with his name on it.He was astonished to see that his granddaughter had bought him an island,a piece of land he had long dreamt of owning to build a vacation home.This island, not found on conventional maps, had been a cherished wish since he first saw it while visiting an old friend in the mountains.


"How did you manage this?" he asked, amazed.

Lilly explained, "It's unclaímed land. To purchase it, I had it registered as a government property under the relevant country. Afterward, I acquired it.11


Caleb beamed with pride. "Why didn't I think of that?"


"I'm glad you like it," Lilly said, smiling. "This is the best birthday present ever, thanks to my precious granddaughter," Caleb declared, pulling her into a hug. "I'm so proud of you." With tears in her eyes, Lilly replied, "I'm happy you love it, Grandpa."

"Where's my great-granddaughter?" Caleb inquired. looking around.

"She's napping. I'll bring her to you when she wakes up. Meanwhile, you should rest before the banquet," Lilly suggested.

"Alright," Caleb agreed.

"I'll supervise the staff to ensure everything is ready," Lilly said before leaving the study.


As Calebgazed at the deed, a bittersweet smile crossed his face.He was overjoyed with the gift but saddened by the absence of his late granddaughters.Their loss still weighed heavily on him. It was this sorrow,coupled with a desire to ease his granddaughter's buardens,that led him to reconcile with his estranged son. He wanted to ensure that Lilly had support, knowing he wouldn't always be there.

It was time for Peter to return.

###Chapter 67

The Blake estate was an architectural marvel, a testament to the family's wealth and influence. It sprawled over acres of manicured lawns and gardens, is buildings echoing a grandeur that had been maintained through generations. The family temple, nestled in the heart of the estate,was a sanctuary of peace and reflection, often used for private family gatherings. În contrast, the grand reception hall, situated near the mansion.was the hub of activity for the evening's celebrations. Its opulent design,with high ceilings adorned with chandeliers and marble floors gleaming under the soft glow of hundreds of lights, was a sight to behold.

As the clock ticked past 6:30 p.m., the first guests began to arrive, their vehicles lining up the cobblestone driveway. Chauffeurs opened doors for elegantly dressed attendees, who stepped out with an air of sophistication and grace. The air buzzed with excitement and anticipation. The elite of society mingled, exchanging pleasantries and warm smiles as they made their way into the hall. Among the guests were members of the esteemed White family, whose military lineage was well-respected across the nation.Other notable individuals included politicians, business tycoons,and philanthropists, all gathered to honor the legacy of Caleb Blake. The media presence was substantial. Reporters and photographers from various outlets hovered near the entrance, capturing every moment.Cameras flashed as esteemed actors and artists arrived, each one stopping briefly to pose and answer questions. The journalists, eager to capture soundbites and statements, thrust microphones toward the celebrities,asking about their relationship with the Blake family and their thoughts on Caleb's remarkable milestone.Inside the hall, the atmosphere was vibrant and celebratory. Lilly, Caleb's granddaughter, stood near the entrance, her eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. When she spotted Sophia and Richard, a genuine smile spread across her face. She moved gracefully through the crowd, her lavender gown flowing around her like a gentle breeze. "Glad you could make it," Lilly said warmly,embracing Sophia and Richard as they reached her.


"We wouldn't miss your grandfather's birthday for the world," Sophia replied with a heartfelt smile. Her eyes twinkled with the genuine affection she held for the Blake family. Beside her, Richard nodded in agreement.

"Indeed. despite any issues between Alexander and me, this is an event we had to attend." Richard added, his voice carrying a note of sincerity. His relationship with Alexander, Lilly's husband, had been strained, but tonight was about family and unity.

Lilly's smile deepened, gratitude evident in her expression. "Thank you for coming and setting aside your differences with Alexander," she said,wrapping her arms around Richard for another hug. The gesture was a testament to the bonds that held them all together, despite any past grievances.

At that moment, Little Viola, Lilly's daughter, dashed across the room, her white princess dress shimmering under the lights. "Uncle Richard, Aunt Sophia!" she squealed, launching herself into Richard's arms.

"Viola," Richard laughed, lifting her up effortlessly. He twirled her around,eliciting a giggle of delight. "Did you miss me?" She nodded enthusiastically, her small hand reaching out to touch a faint bruise on his face. "What happened?" she asked with childlike curiosity. "Uncle was being careless," Richard replied, brushing off the question with a smile. It was a simple explanation meant to shield her from the complexities of adult life.

Sophia and Lilly exchanged knowing glances, the real reason for Richard's injury unspoken between them. They both understood the need to protect Viola from unnecessary worries.


The little girl, however, had her own opinions. "Then stop being careless,"she admonished him with a stern look, mimicking the tone of a concerned parent.


Richard chuckled, nodding in agreement. "I promise," he said, his tone playful yet sincere.


Satisfied with his response, liy turned her attention to Sophia, wrapping her arms around her. Lilly then asked Sophia, "Where's Theo?"her eyes wide with curiosity, referring to Sophia and Richard's young son.

"He's at home with his grandmother," Sophia explained gently, smoothing down Lilly's hair with a tender touch.

Viola's face fell, disappointment evident in her pout. "Why didn't you bring him?"


Sophia smiled, exchanging a glance with Lilly. "He's too young for such a large gathering," she said softly. "He'd cry all night with so many people around."


Understanding dawned on Viola's face, and her disappointment melted away. "Okay," she said brightly. "Can I have cookies?"

"Of course," Richard replied with a grin, carrying her toward a table laden with an array of delectable treats. Cookies, cakes, and pastries were artfully arranged,tempting anyone who glanced their way. As Richard and Viola explored the table, Sophia and Lilly continued their conversation. The bond between them was strong, forged through years of friendship and shared experiences. "Is Alexander here yet?" Sophia inquired, her gaze scanning the crowd for any sign of Lilly's husband.

"Not yet, but he'll be here soon," Lilly assured her, glancing at her watch.


"You look stunning in that dress, Lilly," Sophia complimented,admiring the elegance of her lavender gown.


Lilly blushed, smoothing down the fabric. "Thank you. Your dress is beautiful too," she replied sincerely.

Sophia,ever the playful one, made an exaggerated bow, prompting a laugh from Lilly. Sophia wore a form-fitting navy blue gown that hugged her figure perfectly, while little Viola sparkled in her white princess dress adorned with sequins,looking every bit the young royalty.

"Where's your grandfather? I'd love to give him my gift," Sophia said,glancing around the room.

"He's over there," Lilly pointed, leading Sophia through the throng of guests to where Caleb was engaged in conversation with his friends.including Wilson White, a figure of notable prestige.

"Grandfather," Lilly called out as they approached.

Caleb and Wilson turned their attention toward the two women. Caleb's face broke into a warm smile as he saw his granddaughter."Come over here," Caleb beckoned, his voice filled with affection. Lilly greeted Wilson with a respectful nod. "Hello, Master Wilson." Wilson smiled back, recalling the initial misjudgment he had made about Lilly, unaware of her connection to Caleb at the time. "How are you?" he asked kindly.


"I'm well, thank you," Lilly replied, her smile genuine.

"Good to hear. Let's start anew," Wilson suggested, offering a handshake to symbolize a fresh beginning.

"Yes, Master Wilson," Lilly agreed,pleased with his gesture.

Turning her attention back to her grandfather, Lilly introduced Sophia."Grandfather, Sophia Jonnson is here to wish you a happy birthday."

Caleb recognized Sophia immediately. She was the daughter of the former governor and now married toRichard Jonnson, a prominent figure in the medical field. Her presence at the celebration was both an honor and a delight. "Hello. Master Caleb. Happy 80th birthday," Sophia greeted warmly,extending her hand.

Caleb shook her hand with a smile. "Thank you, Sophia. How's your father? I haven't spoken to him since his retirement."

"He's well, and I'll pass on your regards," Sophia replied,pleased to reconnect old acquaintances.

With a gesture of sincerity, she handed Caleb a small gift box. Caleb,intrigued,asked Victor, one of his trusted aides, to take it and open it. As Victor lifted the lid, the contents were revealed: an emerald ring, glistening and pristine. ′′Ilost this ring in an auction. How did you get it?" Caleb asked.astonishment coloring his voice. 11Itappeared in another auction, so I bought it for you." Sophia explained simply, a smile on her lips.


Caleb, touched by the thoughtfulness of the gift, remarked, "It must have been expensive."


Sophia shook her head lightly. "Doesn't matter. Happy birthday," shesaid with genuine warmth.


Caleb beamed, appreciating both the gesture and the gift. "It's a beautiful gift. Thank you, Sophia."

As Lilly gently led Sophia away from the gathering, she assured her grandfather, "We'll be back soon, Grandpa." However, as they turned to leave, a familiar voice interrupted them,freezing Lilly in her tracks.

"Lilly?"

The voice belonged to Peter, her father. Lilly turned slowly, her eyes wide with disbelief. It had been three long years since she had last seen him.since he had left her behind. "Father?" she whispered, the word carrying a mix of shock and emotion.
###Chapter 68

Peter approached Lilly with a smile, enveloping her in a warm hug. "I've missed you so much, my child," he said, his voice thick with emotion. Lilly had thought she would be angry when she saw him again, maybe even lash out at him for abandoning her instead of seeking forgiveness. But here she was, feeling nothing but happiness at his return.


She wrapped her arms around him, holding him tightly. "Father," she said.her voice trembling with emotion.


Caleb watched the scene with a satisfied smile. He had orchestrated his son s return, ensuring that Peter would be there for this momentous occasion.


Around them, guests at the banquet paused to observe the father-daughter reunion. Those who knew the backstory began to whisper among themselves.


"It looks like the old master has asked his son to come back."

"Yes, that's how it appears."

"Do you think she'll forgive him?"


"Judging by the look of things, she might."

Meanwhile, little Viola, who had been enjoying her cookies, stopped eating when she noticed tears in her mother's eyes. Confused by the man standing with her mother, she assumed he was the reason for her tears.She looked up at her uncle Richard, seeking answers. "Put me down, Uncle Richard." "Why? Where are you going?" "To see Mommy," she said, pointing towards her mother.

Richard followed her gaze and was surprised to see Lilly's father. "He's back."


Viola, still curious, asked, "Uncle, do you know that man?"

"Yes, Viola, he's your grandfather."

Her brow furrowed in confusion. "Grandfather?"

Richard nodded."Yes."

"Why is he making Mommy cry?"

"I think those are tears of joy."

"Hmmm," she said thoughtfully.

"Do you want to go meet him?"

She nodded.


Richard stood up from their seat and walked towards Lilly. He gently placed Viola on the ground, and she walked over to the man and her mother.


"Mommy, who is this?" she asked, pointing at Peter, who looked down at her with a wide smile, clearly filled with pain from missing her early years.


Though Uncle Richard had already told her who he was,she still wanted her mother to confirm it. Lilly picked her up, holding her close. ′′Tlhis is your grandfather, Mommy's father." Little Viola blinked, trying to process the new information. She had always known about her great-grandfather, but she hadn't realized she also had a grandfather.

Peter smiled at her warmly. "Do you want me to carry you?" he asked gently.


Viola nodded, and Peter lifted her into his arms. "You're so big already and so adorable. Grandfather regrets not being here when you were born,"he said, his voice tinged with sadness.

Lilly smiled sadly, recalling how her father had been disowned by her grandfather, forcing him to leave. Now that he was back, it meant her grandfather had accepted him again. Lilly glanced towards Caleb,who smiled and nodded encouragingly.

Seeing her father and Viola getting along, she decided to step away and use the opportunity to call Alexander, who had not yet arrived.

"Are you ready to forgive him?" Richard asked as she approached.

"I think so. I didn't realize how much I missed him until now," she admitted.

Richard smiled. "It's good you are. You need him."

"I do," she agreed.

"I'll go meet Sophia. You should call Alexander," Richard said,walking away. Lilly went to the spacious balcony near the pool to call Alexander. The calm and quiet atmosphere, coupled with the fresh air, provided a serene backdrop. She closed her eyes, taking deep breaths,feeling grateful that her father was back. She took out her phone to call Alexander.

"Looking for me?" came Alexander's voice. He had just entered the banquet hall and scanned for her, paying no heed to the now-silent hall.

Lilly turned and smiled, running to hug him. "Alexander," she said, her arms wrapped around him.


Alexander looked at her face. "Did you cry?"

She nodded.

Alexander frowned. "Why?"

"I'm just being emotional. I'm actually happy that my father is back."

"Your father is back?"


She nodded. "Yes, and I didn't know I would miss him this much."

"Are you glad he is back?"

She nodded again. "Yes."

"Are you ready to forgive him?"

"Yes, I am."


Alexander wiped her tears and kissed her forehead. "Don't ruin your makeup. It looks good on you."

She laughed and nodded. "Where is Viola?""She's with my father. They're already getting along," Lilly said with a smile.

Alexander nodded. "I don't even know if your grandma and Sandra are here yet."


"They are. They arrived at the same time as I did."

"Okay," she said, relaxing her head on his chest.


Alexander wrapped his arm around her. "The view here is nice. Doyou want to stay longer before they start serving meals?"

"We should go inside. Don't you plan on giving your grandfather his gift?"

"No."


"Why?" Lilly raised her head to look at him.

"Because his gift hasn't arrived yet. It will come in a few weeks."

"What is it?"

"I can't tell you yet, but it's something he'll like," Alexander smiled.


Lilly gazed at him suspiciously. "Okay, if you say so. We should go inside now."


Alexander held her hand, and they both wvent inside. The banquet continued with everyone eating, drinking, and dancing. The air was filled with laughter and music as the guests celebrated the joyous occasion. The clinking of glasses and the harmonious tunes of the orchestra added to the festive atmosphere. Not far from the Blake estate,an old car was parked by the road. A woman in a nose mask and hoodie sat inside, watching the banquet live on her cell phone. She had an inside man secretly filming the event.

She frowned as she saw Lilly dancing happily with Alexander and their daughter. Her eyes narrowed, and her grip on the phone tightened,revealing the bitterness she held within. "Let's see how long this happy family will last," she said, clenching her fist, her voice barely a whisper but filled with malice.


The celebration continued inside, oblivious to the ominous presence lurking outside. The guests enjoyed themselves, indulging in the exquisite dishesserved by the renowned chefs hired for the occasion. Caleb,the patriarch of the family, moved from table to table, engaging with his friends and family, his heart full of joy at having his family reunited.

Peter, still holding Viola, approached Caleb with Lilly by his side. The three generations together was a sight that warmed many hearts in the room. Caleb's eyes shone with unshed tears as he looked at his son and granddaughter. "It's good to have you back, Peter," he said, his voice choked with emotion.


"It's good to be back, Father," Peter replied, his voice steady but filled with gratitude.


Viola,perched on her grandfather's shoulder, looked between the two men.sensing the weight of their words. She didn't fully understand the complexities of their past, but she felt the love and reconciliation in the air. As the night wore on, Lilly and Alexander moved to the dance floor,swaying gently to the soft melody. Viola, now with Richard and Sophia,watched them with a smile. Her small heart was content, surrounded by family and love. "Look at them," Sophia said, nodding towards Lilly and Alexander. "They're perfect together."

Richard agreed, his arm around Sophia. "They deserve this happiness."


Meanwhile, Peter stood with Caleb, both men observing the scene with pride. "Thank you for bringing me back," Peter said, his voice filled with gratitude.


Caleb placed a hand on his shoulder. "We all make mistakes, son. It's how we make amends that matters."


Peter nodded. his eyes on Lilly, who laughed as Alexander spun her around. "I won't leave again. I promise."

Caleb smiled, squeezing his son's shoulder. "I know you won't."

The night continued with laughter and joy, each moment building on the last, creating memories that would last a lifetime. As the clock struck midnight, the guests gathered around Caleb, raising their glasses in a toast to the man who had brought them all together.

"To Caleb," Alexander said, his voice carrying over the crowd. "A man who has taught us the true meaning of family."

"To Caleb!" the guests echoed, their voices mingling with the music and laughter.

Not far from the Blake estate, an old car was parked by the road.A woman in a nose mask and hoodie sat inside, watching the banquet live on her cell phone. She had an inside man secretly filming the event. She frowned as she saw Lilly dancing happily with Alexander and their daughter."Let's see how long this happy family will last," she said,clenching her fist.
###Chapter 69

"Papa?"

"Yes,darling?"

"You once told me grandpa had passed away."

Alexander moved his attention from his tablet to her. "Yes, do you want to visit his resting place?"


"I would love that."

"Alright, we will go there when we visit the family estate.For now,you need to finish your breakfast so you won't be late for school."

"Okay." Viola looked down at her cereal. She was sitting at her small table having breakfast while her father sat at the main dining table with his coffee. She picked up her spoon and began to toy with her food.


"What's wrong, darling? You don't like the cereal?" Alexander asked,noticing her hesitation.


"I like it."

"Then why aren't you eating?"

"Because I wanted to ask you something."

Alexander put down his tablet and gave her his full attention. "What do you want to ask, sweetheart?" "What about grandma, your mother?" She blinked up at him with wide eyes. Alexander paused, pondering the best way to answer. "She's far away."

"Far away?"

"Yes,Viola."

"Where? Is she dead?"


"No." As much as he wanted to say she was dead to him, he couldn't say that to his daughter, knowing she would then ask to visit a grave that didn't exist.


"Where is she. Papa? I want to meet her."

Alexander's expression darkened.


Seeing the frown on her father's face, little Viola wondered if she had done something wrong.


"You can't meet her because she is far away in a place she can't return from."


"Why can't she come back? Doesn't she want to meet me,her granddaughter? Doesn't she want to come back to her family,to you,just like Mommy's father did?" she asked,full of curiosity.


Her persistent questioning irritated Alexander. Sincethe party, Viola had been asking many family-related questions. He had anticipated her asking about her grandmother but hadn't expected her to be so relentless.

"Viola," he called sternly. Viola pouted, tears welling up in her eyes. Her father had used her full name harshly, indicating sh e was about to be reprimanded. "Eat your food. You'll be late for school."

Now he understood why she had wanted her mother to leave for work without her and why she wanted to have breakfast with him and have him take her to school. She had planned to ask these questions. How clever.


"But.Papa..."

"Quiet," he cautioned.

Unable to hold back any longer, she started crying, tears streaming down her face.


Alexander sighed, feeling a pang of guilt for making his daughter cry.He stood up, walked over to her, and lifted her from her chair, allowing her to rest her head on his chest. He gently rubbed her back.

"Stop crying. Papa is sorry for raising his voice."

She sniffled, blinking away her tears.

Alexander wiped her tears with his hand. "How old are you again?"

Viola was surprised by the question but answered anyway. "I will be three soon," she said with a smile,remembering her upcoming birthday.

"Mmm," Alexander murmured. Sometimes she acted so mature, and other times she was the little child she really was, Reflecting on the gift she had given her great-grandfather,Alexander and others had been astonished that she had chosen a special ink pen crafted by a renowned pen master. He had initially thought Lilly had suggested it, but his daughter had selected it on her own. Now she was crying like the child she was, reminding him of her age.

"Papa?"

"Mmm?"

"Did you forget how old I am?" She wondered why her father would ask her age.

"I didn't."

"Then why ask?"

"Because sometimes you act like an adult, and other times you behave like the child you are,like now."


Viola smiled. "Because my IQ is high."。

Alexander chuckled. "Your IQ?"

She nodded.

Clara smiled as she watched the father and daughter bonding.

Meanwhile, at the Blake Group headquarters, Lilly was in her office on the 11th floor. At home, she was a wife and mother, but at work, she was a strict boss. Sitting in her executive chair with arms crossed, she looked at her assistant, Karina, and the team leader of the project planning department. "What did you say the name of the company was again?" she asked Aden,the team leader. "The nameis BSC Company. It's an international firm, and they want to partner with us." Lilly had arrived at the office that morning to find out about a company her grandfather had approved for a partnership without her consent. The project file, meticulously prepared, had only required her signature. She wondered why her grandfather had approved working with the company without consulting her, the president. She had immediately asked her assistant to investigate the company and its owner.

"Did you find out who owns the company, Karina?" Lilly turned to her assistant. who was staring at her tablet in shock.

"What is it?" Lilly asked, noting the astonished look on Karina's face.

"Ma'am,it's..."

"Who? Is it someone I know?"

"Yes,ma'am."

"Hand me the tablet, let me see."

Karina walked over and handed her the tablet.

Lilly took it and saw her father's image on the screen. "What's this? Why
is my father's photo here?"

"He is the CEO of BSC."

Her father was the CEO of BSC? She was stunned.
###Chapter 70

She had spoken to her grandfather the day before, and although he had returned to the office, he hadn't mentioned that he was the head of BSC and intended for them to collaborate. Was this his way of mending their relationship by withholding information? Her grandfather, however, didn't see the need to share this with her. She slowly scrolled through the tablet,reading about his role as chairman of BSC, a company dealing with construction. According to the information, he had founded the company from scratch in France three months after leaving their home country. She continued reading, taking in all the details.

Lilly handed the tablet back to Karina, who stood nearby.

"What will you do now, ma'am?" Karina asked.


"Arrange a meeting with them for tomorrow," Lilly replied.

"Okay, I'll do that right away. Anything else you need?"


"Reschedule my last meeting to 5 PM. I have dinner plans with friends who just returned to the country."

"Got it. I'll take care of it."

Lilly turned to Adam. "Review their project proposal and note any changes we might request during tomorrow's meeting."

"Understood," Adam said before leaving the office.Both Karina and Adam could sense their boss's displeasure with the news she had received. After attending her final meeting of the day, Lilly returned to her office to prepare for her dinner date with Michael and Jacob, who had just returned to the country. As she gathered her belongings, she received a calI from her father but chose to ignore it. not ready to speak with him until their meeting.


Was she upset that he owned a new company and wanted to collaborate?No,what angered her was his decision to keep his intentions from her.opting for secrecy. If he wanted to keep things professional, so would she.

After giving Karina her final instructions, Lilly took the elevator down to the underground garage, where Pedro and Roland were waiting for her in the car. For three years, they had been her bodyguards. Despite Alexander's suggestion to replace them. Lilly insisted on keeping them, having grown accustomed to their presence.


"Good day, ma'am," they greeted in unison.

"Good day, Pedro and Roland," she replied with a smile.

"Where to next,ma'am?" Pedro asked.

"I have a dinner date with Michael and Jacob," Lilly informed them,knowing they were familiar with her friends. She gave them the location.and soon they were on their way.

Halfway to the restaurant, her phone rang, Seeing Alexander's name on the screen,she smiled and answered the call.

"Alexander." "Where are you going?" was his immediate question. Lilly glanced at Pedro and Roland in the front seats. Clearly, someone had informed Alexander of her movements, but it wasn't them. "You left the office. Where are you headed?" he pressed.

So he had people watching her again. He always did this for safety reasons.
The last time was when she was newly appointed as the president of the Blake Group, but she had made him stop. Now he was doing it again.

"Are you monitoring me again? Why?" she finally asked. Was something happening that she didn't know about? He usually did this when he felt she was in danger.


The line was silent, and all she could hear was his sigh.

"Alexander," she called. "Is something wrong?"

"No,nothing is wrong."

"Is Viola with you at the office?"

Alexander looked at Viola, sleeping in his resting room. "Yes, she's sleeping. She must be exhausted from her day at school."

"Okay."

"You still haven't told me where you're going," he said more seriously.

"Michael and Jacob are back, so I have a dinner date with them," she said excitedly, happy to see her friends after a year apart.

He was silent again.

"Alexander, are you still there?" "Mmm," was his only response. Alexander still didn't like Jacob and Michael because they were men. He had once said he should be the only man she was close to, both as a husband and a friend.


"You don't like it, do you?”


"Are you really asking that? You know I don't," Alexander replied.

Lilly bit her bottom lip. "They're like family. Why can't you see it that way?"


"I can't."

"Stop being jealous."

"I can't help it."

Lilly smiled. "You love that I do, don't you?"

"Well, a little," she admitted.

She heard him chuckle.

"Don't stay out too long. Be home by 7 PM."

Lilly looked at her watch. It was already 6 PM. How did he expect her to be home by 7 PM? Was she supposed to spend only ten minutes with Michael and Jacob?


"But 7 PM is too early. It's already 6 PM, and I haven't even reached our meeting place." "Fine, get home by 8 PM," he conceded before hanging up. "You wish," she murmured. She planned to stay out until 9 PM since it had been so long since she last saw them. Upon arriving at the luxury restaurant, she was immediately directed to the reserved floor. She felt as if someone had followed her as she entered the hotel.


Taking the elevator to the third floor, she walked into the restaurant and quickly located the reservedtable. She kept her eyes on the entrance to see if anyone followed her, but no one did. She was certain someone had trailed her.


Deciding to focus on her evening, Lilly ordered a glass of water while she waited. Ten minutes later, Michael and Jacob walked in,and she rushed to greet them.


Unable to contain her excitement, she hugged them both tightly. Socialites who recognized her began taking photos, particularly of her embrace with Michael. Unbeknownst to her, the images quickly spread online.
###Chapter 71

"I really missed you guys," Lilly said as they sat at their reserved table.

"I missed you too. I rushed back because I missed Viola as well. Has she been asking about me?" Michael asked.

"I told her you two were coming today, and she was thrilled."

"I can't wait to see her," Michael said.

"Her birthday is coming up soon, right?" Jacob asked.

"Yes, she will be three next month."

"I need to think about what to get her for her birthday," Michael said.

"Me too," Jacob added.

"She's growing up so fast, isn't she?"

"Way too fast. I wish she would just act her age because sometimes she behaves like an adult," Lilly sighed.

Jacob and Michael both smiled. "She's very smart. I wish I had a child like that,"Jacob admitted.


"You can, if you get a girlfriend and settle down," Lilly teased.
 
Michael laughed at the horrified look on Jacob's face. "You should do the same, Michael," Lilly said. "I'll pass." "Me too," Jacob added. Lilly couldn't believe her ears. "Are you both planning to stay single forever?"


Michael and Jacob exchanged a look.

"What's that look?" Lilly asked, noticing their silent communication.

"We're planning to start a tech company together. There will be so much work that we won't have time to look for girlfriends," Michael explained.

"Really? That sounds like a great business. I can't wait to be your first business partner. Cheers to a successful venture!"


They raised their glasses and made a toast.

After taking a sip, Lilly set her glass down. "But still, you both should give it a try. You can go on blind dates." She wanted them to settle down since they weren't getting any younger.

Both men shook their heads. "Not now."

"We'll let things happen naturally," Jacob said.

Lily pouted. "But I want to be a godmother or an aunt."

"You'll have to wait a while," Jacob replied.

She sighed. "I really miss Sarah. If she were here, she would help me convince you both."


"Nothing would change," Jacob said."We'll see about that. Once I tell her, she'll start matchmaking for both of you." "Oh no,please don't" Michael pleaded, knowing Sarah's capabilities.


"Please don't," Jacob shook his head.


"I thought you said it wouldn't change anything."

"I was wrong. You don't need to talk to her."

Lilly smiled: "I won't if you say so."

"When was the last time yousaw her?"


"She visited three months ago, and I haven't seen her since. I really miss her." Sarah had moved to G City six months ago for a job opportunity she loved.


"Have you thought about visiting her? Jacob and I are heading to G City in a few days. We can see her then.Do you want to come?"

"As much as I'd love to, I can't. I'm a wife, a mother, and I run a company.These three things need me here."


"We'Il send your regards."


Their meals arrived, and they continued chatting and laughing.


Her phone rang, and when she saw who was calling, she ignored it and kept talkíng. Her father must have heard about the meeting anad wanted to explain himself. Too late. The phone rang again, catching Michael and Jacob's attention. "You should answer that," Michael suggested. Lilly looked at her ringing phone and decided it was best to pick it up, but not there, "Excuse me, I'll be back." She walked out of the restaurant and headed to the restroom to take the call.Someone at a distant table immediately stood up and followed her.

In the restroom, Lilly answered the call and waited for him to speak.

"Lilly," Peter said, but she remnained silent. He had just learned about the meeting and was surprised.


"Why did you call?" Her tone saddened him. It felt like they were back to square one. If he had known, he would have told her first before his father.He just wanted his grandfather's approval first.


"My assistant just informed me about tomorrow's meeting. I was really surprised. I didn't think Father would approve the project."

"You didn't know when you presented it to him?"


Peter sighed. "I was going to tell you tomorrow evening when we have dinner at the family house. Unfortunately,you already know."


"I'm busy right now. We'll see each other at the meeting tomorrow.Goodbye." She hung up before he could respond.

As she washed her hands, she heard the restroom door open and close.She looked towards the entrance and saw a middle-aged woman standing by the door. The woman, with blonde hair and wearing a black hoodie,looked like she came from the streets. Lilly found her suspicious since she was just standing there staring. She dried her hands and picked up her bag to leave but the woman blocked her way. "Excuse me, you're in my way." "I know," the woman replied.

Lilly raised an eyebrow and gripped her bag tighter,reaching for her phone.


"No need to do that. I'm not here to harm you. I have a message from Angela Kane."


"Angela Kane?" Lilly asked in surprise, referring to Alexander's mother.

"Yes, Alexander's mother. I was released from prison last week, and before I left. she asked me to meet you. So I came to Aurora City immediately after my release."


"Alexander's mother is in prison?"

"Yes, and her son is the one keeping her there."
###Chapter 72

Lily was taken aback by the news that Alexander was keeping his mother in prison. She scrutinized the woman before her, unsure whether to believe her claims about Angela being incarcerated. Although no one, including Alexander, had ever mentioned his mother's whereabouts, she never imagined prison would be where she was.

"How do I know you're telling the truth?" Lily questioned.

"It's Amanda," the woman replied.

"Alright. Amanda, how do I know you're not lying or have some other motive?" Lily pressed.

"Why would I travel all the way from G City to Aurora City just to tell a lie instead of being with my family?" Amanda said seriously.

Lily examined her closely, seeing sincerity in her eyes. "You mentioned you came from G City. Were you imprisoned there?"

"Yes, that's where Angela is too," Amanda confirmed.

Lily nodded. "What do you mean by Alexander keeping her in prison?"

Amanda pulled a piece of paper from her pocket and handed it to Lily. "It's a letter she asked me to give you. She couldn't write it herself because she's under constant surveillance. While others in prison have some freedoms, she is only allowed to labor, eat, sleep, and read about her son in newspapers and magazines. Alexander ensures she can't call,be visited,or send letters."

Lily looked at the paper. "So you wrote this after getting out?" Amanda nodded. "Yes, but these are her words to you." Lily opened the letter and read:


"HELLO,LILY. I'M ANGELA, ALEXANDER'S MOTHER. I WOULD LOVE TO MEET WITH YOU."


Lily checked both sides but found nothing else written. "That's it?"

"Yes."

"She wants us to meet?"

"Yes."

"But you said no one can visit her."

"You'll go in as a prison warden. In about five days, new wardens will be added in the women's prison in G City, and you'll be one of them to see her."


"Did she tell you why she wanted to meet?"

"I was closeto her in prison, so yes, she told me why and everything that happened. She helped me when I first arrived, and we becamne close.Her sentence was 15 years, and she should have been released three years ago,but Alexander ensured she stayed."

"Alexander did that?" Lily was shocked. She knew how ruthless her husband could be but didn't realize he was this heartless. "Yes,we all witnessed it. She was ready to leave one Friday morning,said her goodbyes, but then learned her sentence had been extended. She was devastated. Angela talked about her son constantly and wished for him to find a good woman and start a family. She regretted her past actions every single day. I wish her son could give her a break; she has paid for her crimes."


Lily listened, seeing the pain and sadness in Amanda's eyes as she spoke.She couldn't believe what she was hearing.


"So please, see her. She doesn't know how long she'll be in prison, but she wants to meet her daughter-in-law, the woman Alexander loves," Amanda said with a smile. "She was thrilled when she found out you got married and even happier when you had Viola."

Amanda continued, "She warned me to be careful and make sure Alexander doesn't find out about this meeting because he's very protective of you. From the moment I followed your car, I saw people watching you.Even here, in this restaurant, you're being watched. I used to do such work,so I can tell when someone is being observed. I'm sure they'll come knocking on this door soon."

As if on cue, there was a knock on the door. Lily looked at it in surprise,then back at Amanda.

"I told you, they're here because you've been in here a long time," Amanda said.

"Who is it?" Lily called out.

"It's me, ma'am," Pedro replied. He was supposed to be downstairs,so how did he know she was in the restroom? This confirmed what Amanda said. "Aren't you supposed to be on the ground floor?" "I came up a few minutes ago to ask when we're leaving and was told you were here. The boss informed us to take you home; it's already 8 PM." Lily checked her watch. It was indeed 8. "I'll be out soon."

"Okay,ma'am. I'll wait in the car."

"How will I get in touch with you?" Lily asked.

"We can't call, but my email is Amanda... Our email conversations will be anonymous. I need to leave now."

"It's best I go first." Lily suggested.

"Yes, that's true."

Lily opened the door and walked out of the restroom. She returned to the restaurant to inform MichaeI and Jacob she was leaving.

"You took so long that we finished our meals, and yours is cold," Jacob remarked.

"Seems the conversation was lengthy," Michael noted.

"Yes, it was," she replied, sitting down and taking a sip of water.

"Do you want me to ask them to warm your food?" Jacob asked.

"No,I have to leave now."

"Why the sudden departure?"

"It's already 8 PM; it's getting late."

"Are you okay, Lily?" Michael asked, noticing her mood had shifted. "I'm fine," she smiled. "Okay then, we'll talk on the phone or visit you at work tomorrow." "Alright, I'll leave now," Lily said. grabbing her handbag and leaving the restaurant.


Michael watched her go,feeling something was off. She had spent a lot of time in the restroom.
###Chapter 73

On her journey home, Lily pondered everything Amanda had revealed.She was certain that Alexander had strictly forbidden anyone from discussing his mother's whereabouts, which is why she had remained in the dark until now. Although Lily occasionally uncovered new aspects of her husband, her feelings for him remained unchanged. What puzzled her now was the reason behind Angela's imprisonment, her fifteen-year sentence, and why Alexander still wanted to keep her confined.

Lily recalled Grandma Helen once mentioning that Angela had been responsible for her son's death, causing a car accident that took his life.But Lily doubted that this was the full story behind Angela's incarceration.Should she confront Alexander about it? He always grew furious whenever she brought up the subject of his mother. Should she ask Ethan or Richard? Doing so would likely anger Alexander even more. Should she make the trip to G city to meet Angela? Was it safe to do so? Lily wrestled with these questions, feeling more confused than ever. A part of her urged her to speak with Alexander first; perhaps going to the prison might be a mistake.


What if this was some kind of trap? she wondered. Alexander wouldn't act without reason, would he? If he was keeping Angela in prison, there had to be a rationale. If there wasn't, then he was harboring deep resentment and refusing to give his mother a second chance. Lily sighed deeply,glancing out the window, surprised to find they were already home, the car parked in front of their mansion. How long had she been lost in thought? Her bodyguards hadn't even mentioned they had arrived.Turning to the front seat, she asked, "Why didn't you tell me we were here?"

"We tried calling you twice, but you didn't respond, ma'am, so we decided to wait," Samuel explained.

Lily ran her hand through her hair, then opened the car door and stepped out. She was greeted by the sight of Alexander and Viola standing at the entrance,watching her. The look on Alexander's face was not one she wanted to deal with, so she focused on her daughter, smiling broadly.

Viola beamed and ran towards her. "Mommy, you're home!”

"Yes, my love," Lily replied, picking her up and hugging her tightly.“I missed my little kitty so much."

"I missed you too,Mommy.”

Lily kissed Viola on the forehead."What did you do after school today?"she asked as they headed into the house, completely ignoring Alexander.

Alexander stood there, watching Lily pass him without a word, which took him by surprise and deepened his frown. After waiting outside for her,even watching her sit in the car without coming out, she had ignored him-why?

“Did anything happen today that I wasn't told about?" Alexander asked the bodyguards, but they shook their heads.

"No,sir,we reported everything that occurred," one responded. “You said she spent a long time in the restroom. Was anyone with her?" Samuel thought for a moment and shook his head. "No, sir.”"You'd better be sure because if I find out something different happened, you're as good as dead," Alexander warned, his tone deadly serious,causing the men to shiver.


Later that night, after Lily had read a bedtime story to Viola and put her to sleep, she returned to the bedroom and found Alexander sitting on the bed, watching her as she enatered. She walked over and sat beside him.

Alexander wrapped his arm around her waist and pulled her close."Mind telling me why I was ignored earlier? You owe me a greeting, a kiss, and a hug,"he said, sounding like a child who had been overlooked.

Lily put her arms around his neck and kissed him. “How was work today?



"Why did you ignore me?" he asked, this time more seriously. It was the first time she had ever done that, and he needed to know what prompted it.


“Because I'm upset with you," she replied with the same seriousness,making him raise an eyebrow.

“For what?”

"You made me come home early. I didn't even get to enjoy dinner with Michael and Jacob. It's been ages since I hung out with them,you know,"she pouted.


Alexander frowned, not because of the excuse she gave but because her mood had shifted from serious to playful. Was she hiding her true feelings?The thought deepened his frown. She might be angry, as she said, but the reason she provided wasn't the real cause.

“You know I'll find out anyway, right? So you'd better tell me now."
Lily was silent for a moment before speaking. "Viola mentioned earlier that she asked you about your mother, butyou got upset..."

"Stop changing the subject, Lily."

“What makes you think I'm changing the subject?"

"What does your ignoring me earlier have to do with Viola asking about that woman?"


"That woman is your mother," Lily said, noting how he always referred to her.


“Enough," he said, his voice rising in anger.

Lily frowned, pushing his hand away from her waist as she stood up."You got angry at Viola because she asked about her grandmother.What did you expect, that she wouldn't ask?”


Alexander couldn't understand why the conversation had shifted to his mother.“Why are we talking about her now?”


“I'm giving you a clue as to why I ignored you earlier. We've been married for three years, Alexander-three years-and you still haven't told me anything about your mother, about what happened, or where she is.Where is she, Alexander? Talk to me, I'm begging you," she pleaded.

She wanted him to tell her himself, to stop her from going to the prison behind his back. "Don't make me do things behind your back," she thought, waiting for him to respond. After a long silence, with them staring at each other, he finally spoke.“ Who did you talk to today?"

"Who did I speak to today? Alexander, this has been on my mind for a long time. I want to know; I'm just as curious as Viola is. You've forbidden anyone from talking about her. No one is telling me anything.Why don't you want to talk about her? Why won't you tell me?"

"I don't want you to know about that woman. She's part of the past,and she'll never be part of my family again. So what's the point of telling you about her?"


Lily sighed. “Since you won't open up to me, I might as well go behind your back," she said and began to walk away, but Alexander pulled her back.


“Let go of me.”

“What did you just say?" His voice was cold and threatening.

“I said I'll go behind your back. Don't say I didn't warn you."


Alexander's grip tightened, his anger rising. “Don't test mne. If I find out you're doing something behind my back, I will punish you."

He was deadly serious, and she could see it. If she acted, he would certainly follow through on his threat. But instead of backing down, she shot back.


"If you dare do anything to me, I'll divorce you!" That was the final straw. In a fit of rage, Alexander grabbed her and threw her onto the bed,climbing on top of her. Lily stared at his bloodshot eyes and swallowed hard. "Care to repeat that?



Lily didn't dare repeat her words, not with him so furious. She tried to free herself, but he held her firmly in place.

“Let go of me.”

Alexander glared at her, enraged that she had threatened him with divorce.“If you ever think of doing that, I'll lock you up in this house.”

He released her, and she wasted no time getting off the bed and walking out of the room, leaving him alone.


She had given him the chance to tell her about his mother,but he hadn't taken it. So in three days, she was heading to G city to see Angela in prison.
###Chapter 74

The next morning, the family of three sat down for breakfast together. Lily ate quickly, not wanting to linger at the table with Alexander,who had been silently watching her. They hadn't exchanged a word all morning,and she could see how much it was bothering him-he was struggling internally.


Alexander kept his eyes on his wife, who had been avoiding him completely. She had slept in their daughter's room last night, leaving hím alone,because she was upset with him. Should he finally tell her about his mother? It's not as if it would change anything.


Viola pouted as she noticed her mother avoiding her father, who had been trying to get her attention since breakfast began. She was sharp enough to figure out that her father was the one at fault.

Viola set her spoon down, gaining her parents' attention.

"What's wrong, sweetie? Don't you like the food?” Lily asked.

"I do, but I don't wvant to eat.”

"And why is that?" Alexander asked.

“Because you two aren't talking."

Lily and Alexander exchanged looks, surprised that their three-year-old had noticed. “Did you two have a fight? Mommy didn't talk to you when she got home yesterday. Daddy, did you make Mommy sad?”Viola always felt sad when her parents argued. Alexander was speechless. There was no denying it; she was asking to see if he'd lie.


"We'll sort it out, like always, baby. Couples argue, but they always make up, right, love?” He glanced at Lily, who shifted her gaze to their daughter,completely ignoring what he'd said.


"Mommy has to go to work now. Do you want Mommny to drop you off at school and buy you something different for breakfast?" Lily asked.


"Yes, Mommy, I'm coming with you." Viola was helped down from her seat by one of the maids and followed her mother out of the dining room.


Alexander sat there, watching as they both left him alone at the table.

His wife and child were upset with him. How was he going to fix this?

The servants glanced at him with pity as he ate breakfast alone. After dropping Viola off at school, Lily headed straight to work. Upon arrival,she was escorted to her office by her assistant, Karina.


"What's my schedule?" Lily asked as she settled into her executive chair,trying to maintain a calm demeanor despite the frustration lingering from her disagreement with Alexander.


Karina handed over her schedule for the day, and Lily quickly scanned it.


“First,you have a meeting with Peter Blake, CEO of BSC, and his team in an hour." After reviewing her schedule for the week, Lily set it down. “What's my schedule for the rest of this week and the start of next?" Karina ran through the details. It was Thursday, which meant Lily had just four days left before she would travel to G City to meet with Alexander's mother. Last night, she'd emailed Amanda, who had shown her photos of Angela in prison. It was the first time Lily had seen pictures of Alexander's mother, and she realized how much he resembled her-Angela was truly beautiful.

"Cancel my schedule for Friday, Saturday, and Monday and Tuesday next week.”

“Huh?”Karina was taken aback.

“You heard me."

“But,ma'am, these meetings are very important."

"Should I cancel them instead, or will you reschedule?"

"I'll reschedule. I'll inform the companies right away about the changes."

“Good.”

“But, ma'am, may I ask why you're canceling the meetings?"

"I'm heading to G City on Saturday. I'll make travel arrangements tomorrow.”


It takes abouteight hours to fly from Aurora City to G City.

“Okay,ma'am. Would you like me to book your flight?" Karina refrained from asking more questions, understanding that her boss's reasons for going to G City were personal. "No need, I'll take care of that." After giving Karina additional instructions, Lily called Michael to let him know she'd be joining him and Jacob in G City on Saturday.

"Wow,you suddenly decided to come along. What changed your mind?"

"Well, I figured since you guys are going, it's the perfect time for me to go too. I'd love to spend time with all three of you."

"That's great! Have you told your husband and daughter?"

“I'll let them know today."

“Okay.”

"Could you book my flight for me at the same time as yours?"

"Of course," Michael replied.

“Thanks. We'll talk later-I have a meeting."

“Bye,Lily.”

“Bye.”

She ended the call and gathered her things for the meeting with her father.


In the meeting room, Lily sat in the executive chair, waiting for a representative from BSC to present their project.

Her grandfather had called earlier, admitting that he'd mistakenly approved the project and handed it over to the project team without waiting for her or her father's input. As Lily listened to the project plan, she couldn't help but acknowledge that it was well-prepared and flawless. "The project plan is excellent, so we can proceed to the next phase. This meeting is adjourned," she announced, standing up and heading out.

Peter followed behind her. "Lily."

She stopped and turned to him. “Yes,Father?”

"Thank you for approving the project, and I'm sorry for keeping you in the dark. Would you be free for dinner this evening? I'd love to have dinner together so we can catch up. You can bring Alexander and Viola along. Let's have a family dinner-I've really missed you."


“Okay, Father, just text me the location and time, and we'll be there." Peter hugged her. “Thanks for letting me back into your life. I've really missed you.”


Lily smiled and hugged him back.“Me too,Father.”

After attending two more lengthy meetings, Lily tiredly walked back to her office, only to be met with a surprise.

When she entered, she found Alexander and Viola sitting on the office couch.


"Mommy's back from her meeting!" Little Viola rushed over and hugged her mother.


“Oh my, this is a pleasant surprise," Lily said as she spun her daughter around, who laughed happily.

“How was school?”

"It was good."

"Did you come to visit Mommy at work?” Viola nodded. "And Daddy too," she pointed at Alexander, who was walking toward them.


Alexander wrapped his arms around both her and their daughter, kissing Lily's cheek. "How's work going?"

Lily didn't respond.

“Apart from that other issue, there's nothing in this world that you could want that I wouldn't give you1, my love. You know I'd do anything for you,right?”


“You know I love you so much and hate seeing you upset."

Lily blinked at his words, which were whispered close to her ear, making her blush.


Viola grinned when she saw this. "Put me down, Mommy.I want to go see Aunt Karina."”


Lily put her down, and Viola used the excuseto leave her parents alone in the office.


After their daughter left, Alexander wrapped his arms around Lily and kissed her on the lips. "I brought you flowers."

"I don't want flowers," she frowned.

“Then what do you want? Just tell me, and I'll get it for you,"he promised.

Lily smiled.“Anything?” Alexander nodded. "I always keep my promises." Lily played with her fingers, thinking about how to phrase her request. She knew he would come to apologize, and she planned to use the opportunity to get what she wanted.

"I'll be going to G City with Michael and Jacob on Saturday. We want to visit Sarah and hang out like old times.”

"Did you say G City?" Alexander frowned.

“Yes,"she watched as his mood shifted.

“No.”

"Why can't I go?" she asked.

“You can ask Sarah to visit instead."


"She visited six months ago, so it's only fair that I visit her this time.Besides, I've never been to G City before, so I could use the opportunity."

Alexander stared at her in silence, clearly struggling with himself. He was trying not to say anything that would upset her, especially since they had just reconciled.


“Then I'll come with you."

Lily immediately shook her head. If he came along, her entire plan would be ruined-she wouldn't be able to visit his mother.


"Why don't you want me to come with you?" Alexander asked, frowning.

Was he beginning to suspect something?
###Chapter 75

"Why don't you want me to accompany you?" he asked, his brow furrowed. He couldn't grasp why she suddenly wanted to go to G City,and the idea of her going unsettled him.

"You really don't need to come along. You have work here, and who will take care of Viola?"


"She can come with us."

"And miss school?"

"Missing a few days of school isn't a big deal."

"It is when her exams are around the corner, and an eight-hour flight to a different time zone would be too tiring for her."

G City and Aurora City were in different time zones, with Aurora City being four hours ahead.


Alexander fell silent, searching for reasons to keep her from going. "I can ask Sophia to take care of her. She'll make sure she gets to school every day. Besides, we could use some time alone, don't you think?"

Lily shook her head. "You still haven't made up with Richard after your argument, and you don't have the best relationship with my friends, so no,I'm going alone on Saturday to G City, and I'll be back on Tuesday." She freed herself from his embrace and took her seat in the executive chair.Alexander turned and stared at her, then walked over, leaned in, and kissed her. "Alright, you can go."Lily smiled, wrapping her arms around him and kissing him again. Alexander pulled her up to deepen the kiss. "You've got a lot of making up to do tonight since you'll be gone for a few days."

Lily giggled, understanding his meaning, and kissed him back. "And I'll make sure to make up for it."

Alexander smirked. "My father wants to have dinner with us tonight."

"Dinner?"

She nodded. "All three of us."

"Viola too?"

"Yes."

He thought for a moment before replying. "Okay, what time and where?"

She gave him the details, and he nodded.

"Come, let's go for lunch. Viola is waiting for us."

"But I have work to finish."

"You can finish it when you get back."

After the family had lunch together, Alexander returned to work, and
Viola went with her mother to the office. She was excited to watch her mother at work since it had been a while. Viola sat on the couch, watching her mother work, dreaming of becoming a boss like her someday. Her father had told her that when she grew up,she would take over from him. Later that evening, they headed to the restaurant for dinner with Lily's 
father. When they arrived, they found her father and Alexander already seated and talking.


"Grandpa!" Viola rushed over to her grandfather and hugged him.

"My brilliant granddaughter. Grandpa missed you so much," he said,hugging and kissing her forehead.


"And I missed you too."

Lily sat beside Alexander and pecked his cheek. "You got here early."

"Yes, I finished work on time."

"Are you two getting along?"

"Yes,since you've made up with him, it's only right that I get along with him. If you hadn't, I wouldn't have either."


His words made her think of his mother. She was going to G City to see her behind his back, without his knowledge. If he found out, Alexander would be furious. She shuddered at the thought.


"What's wrong?" he asked, noticing her hands were warm and slightly damp.

"Nothing,I'm fine."

Alexander studied her briefly before nodding.

"We should order before it gets too late,"Peter said. "I want chicken,Grandpa." The adults laughed at her straightforwardness. "Of course, I'll make sure they bring you some chicken."

"Thanks,Grandpa."

"Anything for my granddaughter."

The family of four enjoyed dinner together, anad after a few hours,they headed home. Viola fell asleep in her father's arms, while Lily rested her head on Alexander's shoulder as they drove home.

Alexander kissed her forehead, then kissed their daughter's. They were the most important people in his life, and he would do anything to protect them.

On Saturday, Lily packed her things and headed downstairs. Her flight was in two hours.
0
Viola pouted when she saw her mother with a suitcase.

"Take the luggage to the car," Lily instructed one of the guards.

"Yes, ma'am."

Lily picked up her daughter and showered her with kisses all over her face.

"I'll miss you, Mommy," Viola said, kissing her mother's cheek with her tiny lips.

Lily smiled. "Mommy will only be gone for a few days,okay?"

Viola nodded firmly. "Okay, Mommy." Lily kissed her forehead again. "I'll be going now." "Okay,Mommy." Lily set her down. "Take good care of her," she told the nanny.

"I will, ma'am," the nanny replied.


She glanced at her daughter onelast time before stepping outside. She was surprised to see Alexander's car still parked there. She thought he had left for workafter saying goodbye.

She knocked on the window, and he rolled it down. "You haven't left yet?"

"Get in. I want to drop you off at the airport."

"Aren't you going to be late for your meeting?"

"I'm the boss. I can't be late."

Lily got in the car, and soon they were on their way to the airport. After a 40-minute drive, they arrived.

"I'll be leaving now. I'll miss you," she said to him.


Alexander leaned in and kissed her,his tongue exploring her mouth as he kissed her passionately. Lily responded in kind, losing her breath until he finally pulled away.


The bodyguards in the front seats respectfully looked away,giving the couple some privacy.


Lily's cheeks flushed.

Alexander smiled at her rosy face. "I'll miss you," "Me too." "Make sure you come back by Tuesday, or I'll come to get you myself." "I promise I'll be back by Tuesday."

"Good girl," he said, gently brushing her hair like she was a child.

"I'll be going now."

"Wait."

She paused, waiting for him to speak.

"Don't do anything behind my back. I'll find out if you do," he warned,his tone serious.


Lily smiled and nodded.

"Goodbye, my love," Alexander said.

"Goodbye."

She got out of the car and swallowed hard. She was going to be in big trouble when he found out what she was planning.

She took her suitcase from the guards and walked into the airport.

She met Michael and Jacob there, and soon they were on their way to G City. After a nine-hour journey, they finally arrived in the evening.

The aerial view of G City was breathtaking; it was beautiful. Although Aurora City was more stunning, the difference between the two was that Aurora City was a business hub, while G City had a more civil and military vibe. Sarah was waiting for them at the airport. She smiled when she saw Michael and Jacob, but when she spotted Lily, she screamed and rushed to hug her. "Oh my God! This is such a surprise! I had no idea you were coming!"Sarah had no clue that Lily was joining them.

"This is the best surprise I've had in months."

Lily smiled and hugged her back. "I've missed you,Sarah."

"I've missed you more."

"Are we invisible now?" Jacob said with a sigh.

"We're always invisible when these two get together," Michael added.

The women walked ahead.chatting, while the men trailed behind like bodyguards.

"This city is so beautiful and peaceful," Lily remarked.

"It's only quiet during the day. You should see it at night."

"Really? It seems to be the opposite of Aurora City. Aurora is buzzing during the day, with everyone rushing to work, including me."

Sarah smiled. "I miss Viola. Did she ask about her godmother?"

"She did. She told me to give you lots of kisses."

"Awww, so sweet. I wish she were here."

"I don't." Sarah raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean you don't? You don't want her to be with her godmother?" sheasked,frowning. "That's not it. I didn't come here just for fun, Sarah. While I'm using this chance to see you, I'm actually here in G City for another reason." Sarah stopped walking and faced her. The serious look on Lily's face told her something was up. "Why are you really here?"

Lily glanced around and saw Michael and Jacob approaching."I'll tell you when we're alone."

"They don't know why you're really here?"

"Nobody knows, but you'll be the first I tell because I need your help with a plan."
###Chapter 76

Sarah was shocked. "What? Alexander's mother reached out to you?" she asked, standing up abruptly from the couch to face Lilly. Lilly had just explained why she had come as soon as she had settled into her apartment.The apartment wasn't spacious enough for all of them, so Michael and
Jacob had booked a hotel nearby, while Lillystayed with Sarah.

"Yes." Lilly confirmed.

"So, it's true? She's really in prison?"

"Yes, and from what I was told, she's already served her sentence,but Alexander is still keeping her there."

"Don't you think he has his reasons for doing that?"

"T've considered that, but Alexander isn't telling me anything. This might be my only chance to talk to his mother."

"But what if this is all a lie? You didn't just believe everything that woman told you, did you? She could be in prison for a good reason,and this could all be a trap."

"You think I didn't consider that? Of course, I came prepared."

Sarah sat back down, her curiosity piqued. "True, you're not one to act without a backup plan. So, what's the plan?" "I got detailed information from Jayla about how to enter the prison disguised as a guard and who to approach to arrange a private meeting with Alexander's mother. If it turns out to be a trap, that's where you come in. You're a secret agent with the national police here in G city,so you have connections." "What kind of heIp will you need?"

"Tve got a Plan B and a Plan C. Plan B is in case Alexander's mother tries to trap me into getting Alexander to release her. I'll need people insidethe prison who can assist me if things go wrong."

"Is Plan B really necessary?"

"Yes,because Alexander will almost certainly find out that I visited his mother. The plan is to leave G city and return to Aurora City before he arrives. If it turns out that his mother is genuine, then Plan B won't be needed, and we'll move on to Plan C-avoiding my husband's anger."

Sarah couldn't help but smile. "This is going to be quite the adventure."




Lilly pulled her disguise tighter as she walked into the prison among the other female guards. She hoped she was mnaking the right decision by coming here to see Angela.


Almost immediately, a senior guard noticed her. Jayla had toldher there would be someone inside to help her meet Angela in private, and the woman staring at her matched the description perfectly. After traveling all the way to G city and witnessing the extent of Alexander's influence here, Lilly had prepared herself for the worst. She knew that by the time she finished speaking to Angela and left the prison,Alexander would likely be in the city. He had people watching his mother around the clock, and she suspected he had people monitoring her from the moment she stepped off the plane. Lilly discreetly made the hand signal Jayla had taught her, indicating that she was the person the guards were expecting. The guard gestured for her to follow.

Lilly trailed behind the guard, who led her to a secluded area of the prison.They stopped in front of a door.

"In here, it's an old storage room. You can meet with her inside," the guard said.

"Thank you," Lilly replied, turning the doorknob and pushing the door open.

Angela was standing by the window when she heard the door.She turned and saw Lilly, her face breaking into a smile. Without warning,she rushed over and enveloped Lilly in a tight hug.

Lilly was taken aback by the unexpected embrace, but Angela held on,not just hugging her but holding her tightly.

When she finally let go. Angela looked at Lilly with a warm smile. "I'm so grateful you came. Thank you,Lilly."

Lilly nodded, still processing the warmth of the older woman's welcome.

"You're even more beautiful in person. The photos in the magazines and newspapers dona't do you justice," Angela said with genuine affection.

"You look so much like Alexander, and you're younger-looking than I expected," Lilly observed, noting the resemblance between mother and son,though Alexander had a more masculine appearance, possibly due to his father's influence. Angela smiled. "I'm glad he only inherited my looks," she said,gesturing for Lilly to sit across from her. Lilly took in the room's dusty surroundings, noticing that only the area around the table and chairs had been cleaned.

"Don't mind the dust; this isan old storage room. I only had time to clean this part." Angela explained.

Lilly nodded and sat down.

"How is my granddaughter? I wish I could see her," Angela said softly.


"She's doing well."

"I'm sure she doesn't know anything about me."

"She doesn't. In fact, I don't know much about you either. All I have are rumors. So, tell me your side of the story. How did you end up in prison?Why is Alexander keeping you here? And why did you want to meet?"

"Those are a lot of questions," Angela remarked.

"Take them one at a time," Lilly said, leaning back in her chair.


"After my husband died because of my infidelity, I planned to leave the country a year later. But at the airport security check, I was caught with drugs in my bag.I thought I could get away with it since the drugs were hidden in my shoes' heels, as the people who gave them to me assured me.But someone tipped off the authorities, and that's how I ended up with a 15-year prison sentence."


Lilly didn't react to Angela's confession but moved on to her next question."Why does Alexander want you to stay here?"Angela seemed surprised that Lilly didn't judge her for her actions."Can I answer the third question before the second?" “Why?”

"It's better that way."

"Go ahead."

"I asked you here because I needed to talk to someone. I've been here for 1S years without any contact with my family or anyone from the outside.You're Alexander's wife, the woman he loves most, and he has refused to see me. I haven't laid eyes on my son since the day his father died,"Angela's voice cracked, and tears welled up in her eyes.

Lilly could feel the pain in her words.

"The only connection I have to the outside world is the magazines and newspapers that feature him. That's how I know he's grown into a handsome man who commands the business world. I never got the chance to beg for forgiveness. I wanted to meet with you, my daughter-in-law, to ask a favor."

"What favor?"

"I've made mistakes my whole life. In here, I've learned from those mistakes. I was a terrible wife and mother. I regret causing my husband's death, who loved me dearly and wanted nothing more than for me to change. I regret not considering how deeply my actions affected Alexander.I regret trying to flee the country with drugs instead of staying to make amends. I regret everything that led me to this prison. Every day,I wish I could turn back time and undo what I did," she said, her voice trembling as she wept. Lilly listened, moved by her words. "I just want one thing-to see my son. Even if he decides to keep me here, I just want to see him and ask for his forgiveness." Angela pleaded, tears streaming down her face.


Lilly didn't realize she was crying too. She leaned in and held Angela's hand. "He's never told me anything about you. Even mentioning your name makes him angry. But I'll see what I can do."

"Thank you," Angela whispered gratefully, tears still falling.

"You still haven't told me why Alexander wants you to stay here." Lilly reminded her.


Angela withdrew her hands. looking down at her feet. "Because I'm a murderer. I killed my own chld."
###Chapter 77

"What do you mean by you killed your own child? I don't understand.Which child are you referring to?"

"I was already three months pregnant when Alexander's father caught me in bed with another man. That was part of the reason he was so devastated that heended up in an accident," Angela's lips quivered as tears rolled down her face.

Lilly opened her mouth to speak but then closed it, utterly shocked.Who in the world gets pregnant and then cheats on her husband? What could have driven her to such desperation? It couldn't have been for money;she married into a wealthy family. So why?

Lilly stared at her, disappointment evident in her eyes. "Why? Tell me why?"

"I'm sorry."

"I'm not the one you should apologize to."

"I know, but I was a horrible person, so I'm sorry you had to learn about someone likeme and the things I did."

"I'll ask again. Why?"

"I was desperate. I couldn't live the life I wanted after marrying Alexander's father and having him." "Why couldn't you change for the man you loved? Why couldn't you change for Alexander, your son?" Angela swallowed the lump in her throat. "I tried my best." "You tried your best? And even after getting pregnant, you couldn't control yourself? Instead, you cheated and caused the death of your husband." Lilly hadn't planned on being so harsh, but after hearing Angela's story, she couldn't help it.

Angela remained silent.

"Go on, tell me, what happened to the child?"

Angela swallowed. "After my husband's burial, the Kane family put me in prison. But they released me when they found out I was pregnant. They agreed to cover my expenses until I gave birth, on the condition that I would leave the child with them and go far away. I had already lost Alexander, who hated me for causing his father's death. I couldn't bear the thought of losing another child, so I decided it was better that the child was dead than for me not to be in their life. I killed my child when I was six months pregnant. I watched as the baby's tiny eyes, heart,legs,and hands were torn apart during the abortion." Her entire body trembled as she spoke.

Lilly couldn't believe what she was hearing. It was so cruel and heartbreaking that she-couldn't stop the tears from falling. This was the height of wickedness. When Grandma Helen told her about Angela,she had conveniently skipped this part. Perhaps she didn't want to rememnber such a horrific act, which is why she didn't speak about it. If this was Alexander's reason for wanting her to remain in prison, then it was justified. "This is pure evil. How could you!" Angela wept bitterly. "I'm ready to pay for all I've done.""And you will pay." Lilly stood up from the chair. "Ithink I've heard enough." She wiped her tears. Shecouldn't remember the last time she cried this much. As a mother, it pained her deeply to hear of a woman killing her unborn child who was already six months along.

Angela stood up as well. "These were my past sins. I regret everything I did."


"Of course, you should! You deprived Alexander of having a sibling. If you hadn't killed that child, maybe Alexander would have forgiven you long ago. But you dared to do such a thing."

Now Lilly understood why Alexander got so angry whenever anyone mentioned his mother and why he refused to tell her anything about Angela. Everything about her was too horrible to recount. Now she understood why he wanted his grandparents to adopt Kate, to fill the sibling void in his heart and life that his mother had created.

"I'm sure Alexander must have had some hope when he learned he was going to be an older brother, but you crushed that tiny bit of joy and hope by killing his unborn sibling! The least you could have done was leave the child with the Kane family. It's only right that the child would have grown up with them and Alexander rather than have a mother like you!"

"Tell me the truth. The real reason you killed your unborn child was that you didn't want another child to despise you as Alexander did, isn't that right?" When Lilly saw Angela look away and cry even harder, she knew she had hit the truth.

"I guess you should get used to staying here until Alexander decides to forgive you."

"I don't mind staying here for the rest of my life since Ideserve it,but all I ask is to see my son, even if it's just for a few minutes. I need him to 
know how much I regret everything I've done and to ask for his forgiveness," Angela sobbed.

Lilly sighed.

"Please," Angela knelt in front of her and clutched her legs. "Please, I beg you. You're the only one who can make him change his mind. You're the only one who can get him to see me. Please."

Lilly's clothes were stained with Angela's tears. "Alright, I'Il see what I can do. Just stand up."

Angela stood up and wiped her tears. "Thank you," she said, hugging Lilly.

"I'm leaving now."

Angela nodded. "Alright. Thank you so much for agreeing to see me, Lilly.
"

"You're welcome."

Lilly knocked on the door, and the prison guards who had escorted her opened it.

"Are you done talking?" the female prison guard asked.

"Yes, it's time for me to go." Angela smiled at her as she walked out the door. She hoped Alexander would come to see her soon. After leaving the prison and changing into different clothes with a hoodie,Lilly crossed to the other side of the road and walked towards the car waiting a short distance away. Lilly got into the front seat, and Sarah, who was in the driver's seat,started the car and drove away.


Sarah glanced at Lilly, whose eyes were red from crying. "What happened in there?"


"A lot. There was so much information that brought me to tears.That woman has done so much harm and damage."

"Do you want to talk about it now or later?"

"I'll give you the full story later."

"Okay, but tell me, why did she want to meet with you?"

"Because she says she wants to meet Alexander. She said he's refused to see her for 18 years now. She wants to beg for his forgiveness."

"Well,how do you plan to convince Alexander?"

"I think I should first deal with the storm that's coming."

"I'm sure he already knows by now and is on his way here."

"Yes, I'm afraid of what he's going to do."

Sarah smiled. "Alexander loves you so much. I've seen how much he loves you these past three years, so he'll surely forgive you for doing this behind his back." "That's after he teaches me a lesson." Sarah laughed. "Gosh, I wish I could be there to see how he's going to punish you." "He warned me before I came here. Alexander was dead serious this time.It's not going to be like any other punishment he's given before."

Sarah said nothing else and just drove. "Since there was no need for plan B, do you still have plan C in mind?"

"Yes, I'm done here. Take me to the airport."

"Aren't you going to say goodbye to Michael and Jacob?They called to know where you were."

"Just tell them something urgent came up, so I had to go back home."

"Okay."

"Are my things in the car trunk?"
 
"Yes."

"Thank you for helping me, Sarah. What would I have done without you?"

Lilly smiled at her.

"You're welcome," Sarah smiled back.

Soon, Lilly boarded the plane back to Aurora City, and just ten hours after she left, Alexander arrived in G City with his private jet.He had gotten the information late that Lilly had actually gone to see his mother. Now it was clear to him why she had asked about her last time;she had planned on visiting his mother. How dare she go behind his back like this? In his anger, he ordered his people to prepare the jet and flew to G City, unaware that Lilly had already left. "Give me her location," he demanded, his voice filled with anger.

"Sir, the thing is..." James hesitated.

"What is it?"

"Ma'am already returned home. According to the information I got,she arrived in Aurora City about an hour ago." Alexander clenched his fist."How smart of her."

"Sir, I just received another update. Ma'am has packed her things and Viola's and is on her way to the Blake family residence right now as we speak."

Alexander's face darkened.

Was she trying to escape her punishmenit? How dare she leave his house!
###Chapter 78
While Alexander thought about how to handle his wife for going behind his back and leaving the house afterward, he received a message from her.

"Sir, there's a message for you."

"Who sent it?"

"It's from Madam."

Alexander's eyes narrowed as he looked at the phone. "Hand it over."

James passed him the phone, and he read the message from his wife.

"IF YOU HAD TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR MOTHER, I WOULDN'T HAVE BOTHERED GOING TO THE PRISON TO SEE HER. YOU SHOULDN'T BLAME ME FOR BEING CURIOUS. I'VE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WILL ONLY RETURN WHEN YOU'VE VISITED YOUR MOTHER.SINCE YOU'RE ALREADY IN G CITY,YOU SHOULD TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HER."


Alexander's expression darkened. Was she trying to challenge him?

He immediately called her, and Lilly answered on the first ring.

"Alexander," her voice came through the line.

"After what you did behind my back, you dare to tell me to visit her!" His anger was palpable.


"Don't you want to know what your mother and I talked about?"Alexander stayed silent, wanting to know both what was discussed and how Lilly had found out his mother was in prison. "How did you find out she was in prison?"

"I'll tell you once you come to pick us up from the family house,but only after you've visited her."

"So now you're giving me ultimatums?"

"No, I'm not," she said, feigning innocence.

"I wish you were here so I could silence you myself."

Lilly fell silent.

"Now you're quiet?"

"Will you see her?"
0
"Over my dead body."

"Please,Alexander, do it for me, I'm begging you. Your mother told me everything she did. It was horrible to hear, and now I understand why you never wanted to talk about her. I'm sorry for going behind your back,but I love you so much. You know I wouldn't normally do something like this without telling you, but I needed to understand what happened," she pleaded, hoping to soften his heart and sway him from punishing her.


Alexander remained silent, knowing his wife had a way of getting out of trouble.


"Alexander?" she called out when he stayed quiet for too long. "Will you see her? I'm not asking you to forgive her orrelease her from prison."

"I'm sure she contacted you, but I'm still wondering how she managed to do it." He was baffled by how his mother had reached out to Lilly or if someone had helped her. "We can discuss that later."

"Did she tell you she wanted to see me?"

"Yes, that's the main reason she wanted me to visit her. She says she regrets everything and just wants to ask for your forgiveness. Even if you don't forgive her, at least hear her out."

"Hmmm."

"Will you go?"

"I'll decide that." Alexander hung up the call.

He turned to James. "Get the private jet ready; we're going back home."

"Right away,sir."

There was no way he would visit that woman in prison. She wouldn't see him again until her dying day.




At the Blake residence, Lilly sighed as the call ended.

"Was that Alexander?" Caleb asked as he entered the livingroom.

"Yes,Grandfather."

"He must be furious with you for going behind his back," he said,settling onto a nearby couch. He had been surprised when his granddaughter arrived with Viola and a few pieces of luggage. Initially, he thought Alexander had done something to upset her, but then he learned that Lilly had upset her husband and fled here out of fear of his reaction.

"He is, but now that I've spoken to him, he won't be as angry."

"He'll come to take you both back home when he returns, you know that,right?"

"I know he'll come here, but I'Il only go back with him after I'm sure he's visited his mother."

"From what you've told me about that woman, Alexander has every right to treat her as he does. If I were him, I'd do even more." Caleb couldn't help but agree with Alexander. He rarely saw eye to eye with the young man, but in this case, he completely supported him.

"I know, Grandfather, but visiting his mother is also for his own good."

"And how is it good for him to see that woman? She'll only bring up memories of the terrible things she's done."

"Not if he sees how much she regrets her actions and sincerely asks for his forgiveness. Talking to her might ease some of the pain he's been holding onto for years."

Caleb sighed. "Do you think he'll listen to you and go see her?"

"I hope so."
 
"And if he doesn't?" "Then I'll stay here." "You should know Alexander by now. There's no way he'll leave here without you and Viola." "Grandfather, won't you help?" Lilly pouted.

"Not this time, Lilly. In this situation,you're in the wrong. So if Alexander comes, I'll let him take you back home." Alexander drove straight to the Blake family estate the moment he arrived in Aurora City. He had dismissed al his guards and drove himself to the house.


He parked in front of the main building and strode inside,ignoring the guards and Victor, who had come out to greet him. He scanned the living room but didn't see Lilly or their child, so he headed directly to her room upstairs.

On his way, he passed some maids who greeted him with bowed heads,but he ignored them. The cold look on his face filled them with fear.

He reached the room door and pushed it open to find Lilly and Viola sleeping peacefully on the bed. The sight was so serene and beautiful that it momentarily dispelled his anger.It was already 11 PM, so it made sense that they would be asleep.


He quietly closed the door behind him and walked toward the bed, his eyes fixed on them. They looked adorable as they slept.

Alexander stood there, watching them for almost 30 minutes.

Little Viola stirred and opened her eyes, immediately spotting her father.

Her eyes lit up. "Daddy!"

Alexander's cold expression softened into a smile. He picked her up and hugged her. "My baby girl."

She placed her tiny hands on his cheeks and kissed his forehead.

Alexander smiled and kissed her forehead in return. "Did Daddy wake you?"

She shook her head. "No."

"Do you want to go home?"

Viola looked at her sleeping mother. "But Mummy's sleeping." Alexander glanced at Lilly, who slept so peacefully, as if she had no worries in the world.


"Do you know the way to your room here?"

She nodded. "It's the room across the hall." Because of how much her great-grandfather adored her, Viola had her own room in his mansion.

Alexander took her to her room and tucked her into bed, kissing her forehead. "Go to sleep, okay? Daddy will come later." She nodded and closed her eyes.

Alexander returned to Lilly's room. He shut the door behind him and walked toward her on the bed.

He removed his shoes, his suit jacket, and his tie, then rolled up his sleeves before sitting on the bed beside her.He gently tapped her shoulder to wake her.Lilly slowly opened her eyes and saw him, his cold gaze fixed on her. "Sit up," he said sternly. Lilly obediently sat up, folding her hands and legs, then looked at him.

"I promise I won't overlook what you did today," he said, hinting at the consequences he had in mind for her.

"Get your things ready; we're going back home."

"Did you visit her?" she asked.

Alexander's expression darkened. "Over my dead body."

"In that case, I'm not going anywhere wwith you." She turned her face away from him.


Alexander clenched his fists tightly. "You're coming home with me,whether you like it or not. Now get up," he ordered.

"No," she responded stubbornly.

"You know I can carry youout of here,right?"

"You're goingto take me home against my will?"

"Yes."

"Just because I'm your wife doesn't mean you should force me."

"You should've known what you were getting into when you decided to marry me."

"So it's my fault I'm in this situation with you?" "Who else's fault could it be?" Lilly continued to look away from him. Alexander grabbed her chin and made her face him. "You're too stubborn for your own good. What am I going to do with you?" He was exasperated.As much as he wanted to punish his defiant wife, he couldn't bring himself to do it.


"Nothing, just forgive me." She moved closer, wrapped her arms around him. and gave him a passionate kiss.
###Chapter 79

Alexander understood what Lilly was trying to do. but he couldn't resist her kiss and responded in kind-how could he resist her? After a long kiss,Lilly pulled away to catch her breath, her eyes meeting Alexander's, filled with desire. He looked at her with such intensity that it made her blush.Lilly wrapped her arms around him and kissed him again, wanting them to become closer.

Alexander gently laid her down on the bed and kissed her more deeply.his tongue exploring her mouth. When he remembered how she had gone against his wishes, he took the opportunity to assert his control,biting her lower lip. causing her to feel a mis of discomfort and pleasure.

He kissed his way down to her intimate area.using his fingers to heighten her pleasure, making her cry out. He continsued to bring her pleasure and at the same time make her feel overw heined, until she could barely take it anymore.

"Alexander...haaaaa,"she moaned.

More than 30 minutes had passed. yet Alesander hadn't moved forward.keeping her in anticipation as pant of her lesson. She wanted all of him.but he delayed, making her wait.

Alexander moved back up, kissing her again before moving down to focus on her chest. She couldn't bear the intensity any longer, she felt as if she might lose control."Alexander... please," she pleaded. Alexander paused and looked at her flushed face, which was begging for him,and he smirked."Please what?" Lilly bit her lower lip. "Please stop teasing me and just make love with me.1


"Not yet," he said and resumed kissing and pleasing her again with his mouth and fingers. She reached her peak several times until she was utterly exhausted.

Finally, Alexander joined with her, starting slowly and then gradually increasing the pace. Lilly cried out in pleasure as his slow movements became faster. Alexander shifted their positions multiple times, moving faster each time.

Lilly tried her best not to cry out since they were in her grandfather's house and Viola was sleeping in the room opposite them. If she had known this would happen, she might not have initiated things-now Alexander wouldn't stop until he was completely satisfied.

After three rounds. Alexander still wasn't fully satisfied.but he stopped because of how tired Lilly was. Alexander wrapped his arms around her as she rested her head on his chest. He kissed her forehead as she drifted off to sleep. When Lilly woke up the next morning, she was alone in the bed. The other side was disheveled, indicating that Alexander had left as soon as he woke up. This was the first time he had left the bed before her,especially after being intimate.

It meant he was still upset with her. She got up, washed up, and chose something to wear that would cover her neck, where Alexander had left his marks. She still felt very weak that morning. After leaving the room, she went to Viola's room and was informed by the maid cleaning the room that they were having breakfast downstairs. She headed downstairs to the dining area, and as she was about to enter,she overheard her grandfather speaking.

"Sometimes Lilly acts immaturely; as her husband, you should overlook her actions at times."

Lilly couldn't believe what she was hearing-was her grandfather speaking on her behalf? When did the two men start getting along well enough to have breakfast together and discuss her?

Lilly walked into the dining area after they stopped talking.

"Good morning, Grandpa," Lilly greeted her grandfather with her head bowed.

Alexander pushed the chair next to him out for her to sit.

Lilly wanted to sit near her grandfather, but when she saw him signaling for her to sit beside Alexander, she obediently walked to his side and sat down.

Alexander placed food on her plate, giving her a bit of everything on the table,mostly vegetables.

"Eat up."

Caleb watched closely, noticing how Alexander calmly showed her affection despite his lingering anger. This made him smile, and he decided to leave them alone to finish their breakfast. "Grandpa, are you going somewhere?" Lilly asked when she saw her gran dfather stand up. "I'm done with breakfast." "But you still have food on your plate, you should eat more, Grandpa."

"T'll eat enough during lunch," he said and left the dining room.

Lilly watched him as he walked out, supporting himself with his walking stick. Her grandfather had taken good care of his health over the years,but now she felt he wasn't doing so as much. She would need to hire someone to help take care of him occasionally-she couldn't bear the thought of losing him.


Alexander held her hand gently when he noticed her worried expression."Don't worry about him, he's a strong man. He'll still be here in 20 years'time," he reassured her.


Lilly looked at him and nodded, "I hope so."

"Go ahead and eat; your breakfast is getting cold."

"Okay, but where is Viola? The maid I met cleaning her room said she was here."


"I already sent Max to take her to school before I came down."

"Oh, I forgot she should be in school by now."

Alexander smiled at her forgetfulness. "Eat up, so we won't be late."

"Where are we going?"

Alexander looked at her with a serious expression. "Did you forget your punishment so soon?" Lilly immediately lost her appetite. She dropped her spoon and looked at Alexander, whose expression was unreadable. Was she really not going to escape her punishment? "Alexander,you still intend to go through with it?"

"IfI don't correct you, you'll continue to act behind my back. To prevent that, I have to do this."

Lilly leaned back in her chair and crossed her arms.

Seeing that she had lost interest in the food. Alexander frowned. "You'd better eat and eat well, because what you're about to face will require a lot of strength."

It seemed she wouldn't be able to avoid it, so she decided to prepare for what was to come.

Alexander picked up the spoon, filled it with food, and held it near her mouth. "Open up and eat."

Lilly looked at him. "No, I'll skip." She turned away, ignoring him.

"Just tell me what my punishment is."

She needed to know what was coming so she could plan accordingly.
###Chapter 80

"If I disclose your penalty now,it will take away the excitement, my dear."Alexander said. Lilly had a strong premonition that whatever was planned for her would be unpleasant, so she needed to prepare herself.

"I need to use the restroom. I'll be down shortly so we can head out," she announced, rising and leaving without waiting for his consent. By the time she was finished with Alexander, he would be too wary to attempt anything against her in the future to avoid losing her.

She checked to ensure he wasn't following her before closing the door and heading to the restroom. Once inside, she sat on the toilet and retrieved her phone. She called Sarah, who answered on the first ring.

"Hey Lilly, how's everything? Did you change his mind? Is he still upset with you? I've been waiting for your call since yesterday," Sarah inquired.bombarding her with questions.

"He's still going forward with his plan to 'punish' me, as he puts it," Lilly replied.

"What's the punishment?" Sarah asked.

"I don't know yet, but I'll be initiating Plan D," Lilly said.

"Wait, there's a Plan D?" Sarah asked, surprised.

After her conversation with them, Lilly checked the time and realized she had been in the restroom for 30 minutes. Alexander might already be at the door waiting for her. She exited the restroom and returned to the room,only to find him sitting on the bed. She was confident he hadn't overheard her conversation, thanks to the restroom's soundproofing. Even after all these years, she still didn't understand why her grandfather had made the restroom soundproof but not the rest of the room. "He's really going to be furious. You might even provoke him into locking you up one day. Isn't your grandfather saying anything?" Sarah inquired.

"Grandfather supports him. He was even pleading on my behalf this morning," Lilly said. She remembered how her grandfather used to discipline her and her late sisters when they were growing up, so his support for Alexander didn't surprise her.

"Seriously?" Sarah asked, disbelieving.

"Yes, so whatever Alexander plans to do, Grandfather won't interfere,"Lilly noted, recalling how her grandfather Caleb used to handle things when they were children.

"So,what's your plan?" Sarah asked.

"You'll find out later," Lilly said with a smile, thinking about it.

After ending her call with Sarah, Lilly contacted Michael and Jacob to share her plan. They weren't supportive and saw it as a risk to their own interests. They knew well how formidable Alexander could be when truly enraged, and what Lilly was about to do would not only anger him but deeply concern him as well. Jacob, in particular, was anxious since he had been instructed to hack into Jack's phone to find out the specifics of the punishment so they could prepare. Alexander gave her a scrutinizing look. "What were you doing in there for over 30 minutes?"


"I was using the restroom," Lilly replied, meeting his gaze.

Alexander looked at her for a moment before standing up and approaching her. Lilly thought he was going to question her further, but instead.he said something different.

"You should change into something else."

"Why? Don't you like this outfit?" Lilly asked, looking down at her clothes and wondering what was wrong with them.

"It's nice, but since you're going to face your punishment, you should wear something more comfortable," he suggested.

What kind of punishment was she going to face? Lilly wondered. By now,Jacob would have already hacked into Jack's phone, but she still had no idea. Whatever it was, she was confident they would come up with a good plan to get her out of it. She just hoped it wasn't at one of Alexander's remote locations, as escaping from there would be nearly impossible.

Alexander watched her as she appeared lost in thought,likely contemplating her punishment.

"Get changed," he instructed, pointing to the outfit laid out on the bed. Lilly's eyes fell on the athletic wear-a pair of exercise pants and a top.Was she going to be doing some sort of physical activity? Alexander disliked clothes that revealed too much of her body, so she wondered why he wanted her to wear such tight-fitting clothes. "You dislike clothes like this, so why do you want me to wear them?" Lilly asked.puzzled.

Alexander looked at the clothes. He indeed disliked it when she wore revealing outfits outside, especially when other men looked at her with desire. Over the past three years, he had dealt harshly with men who dared to look at her inappropriately.

It took him considerable resolve and multiple considerations before he allowed her to wear this, given that there was no other choice. "If anyone dares to look at you with inappropriate intent, I will ensure they regret it,"Alexander warned.


Lilly knew he was serious. He had almost followed through on a similar threat before when one of Blake's business associates had ogled her during a meeting. Alexander hadn't been present, but how he discovered it made Lilly realize he kept a close watch on hef.

"Get dressed," Alexander repeated.

Lilly picked up the outfit and went to change in the closet. When she emerged, Alexander was no longer in the room. She put on sneakers and took her phone before leaving.

"Are you heading for a workout?" her grandfather Caleb asked when he saw her outfit.

Lilly glanced at her sportswear. "Alexander said it's part of my punishment," she explained. As soon as she finished speaking, Caleb burst into laughter. "Grandpa, it's not funny," Lilly protested. "It is to me," Caleb said with amusement. 
"How is me being punished funny?" Lilly's frown deepened.

"It's just a minor correction a husband gives his wife," Caleb explained.still chuckling.

Lilly wanted to ask if this was how he disciplined her grandmother but chose not to, not wanting to bring up painful memories.

"Really?" Lilly asked.

"Yes," Alexander said as he came down the stairs.

Lilly turned to him and frowned. "Is this what the scriptures say about how husbands should treat their wives?"

Her eyes widened at her own question. Alexander and Caleb looked at her in shock.

"Says the wife who doesn't even own a Bible," Alexander replied, amused.
Caleb shook his head and stood up to leave the room.

"Grandpa," Lilly called, unable to believe he was allowing this.

"Goodbye,granddaughter," Caleb said as he went to his study.

Alexander took her hand. "We should leave now."

As they left the house, Lilly glanced back, hoping her grandfather might intervene. They got into the car, and the chauffeur drove them out of the estate. Lilly kept her eyes on the road, trying to discern their destination. Thirty minutes later, they had left the city, traveling on a highway toward the mountains. Lilly glanced at Alexander, who was intently focused on his laptop. "Alexander," she said.

"Mmm," he responded without looking up.

"Where are we going?" she asked.

"You'll find out," he replied vaguely.

"Did it really anger you that I went to see your mother, or is it because I did it without informing you?" Lilly asked.

Alexander stopped typing and looked up with an expressionless face."Both," he replied plainly.

"You didn't think I needed to know about her. If you had told me,I wouldn't have gone to see her. If you were in my place, what would you have done?" she asked, but Alexander femained silent. He returned to his work,ignoring her.


Lilly turned to the window, her thoughts a whirlwind of emotions. The colorful autumn leaves gently swayed in the breeze, creating a beautiful view outside.

After about an hour, the car stopped in a wooded area with rocky terrain and tall mountains. The peaceful surroundings were broken only by the rustling leaves and distant bird calls. Lilly got out of the car,followed by Alexander, who signaled to his men to bring over the supplies. They promptly brought a large backpack. Alexander took the backpack, placed it on her back, and then put a coat on her. Lilly was confused. "Alexander,can you explain this to me?" she asked, bewildered. "You're going to climb the mountainto the other side," Alexander said.pointing into the distance.

Lilly's jaw dropped. "Is this my punishment?"

"You'll climb the mountain. The backpack contains a tent for you to sleep in if you don't make it to the other side before dark. I didn't plan to provide any food, just water, but since you missed breakfast, I included lunch. Good luck reaching the other side," he said.

Lilly stared at him in disbelief. Was this the man she loved, married,and had a child with? She knew he could be ruthless, but she hadn't expected this level of severity.

"Alexander, you want me to climb this mountain for a whole day? What will you tell Viola when she asks where her mother is?" she questioned.

"I told her you're on a business trip," Alexander replied.

"You told her what?" Lilly asked, astonished.

"You heard me."

"And what about my work? I run a multi-million dollar company," Lilly said,exasperated.


"You'll return to work tomorrow. If you want to reach the other side on time, I suggest you start climbing," Alexander said coldly."Alexander, look at me," Lilly pleaded, placing her hand  on his face. Alexander turned to her, his expression stilI cold. Lilly's heart ached as she looked at hím. "Are you sure you want me to go through this? To climb this mountain?" she asked.

Alexander remained silent.

"Look me in the eyes and tell me you truly want this," Lilly urged.

Alexander met her gaze but said nothing.

"Think it over, Alexander. I'm giving you a chance to reconsider.You'll only hurt yourself if you follow through," Lilly said.

Did she think it was easy for him to let her do this?

"I wouldn't be here if I hadn't considered it thoroughly," Alexander said.

Lilly withdrew her hands and gave him one last look before turning and starting her climb up the mountain without another word.

Alexander took a few steps forward but stopped, his fists clenched. He didn't want to do this, but his pride prevented him from backing down after warning her not to act against his wishes.
###Chapter 81

"Max."

"Yes,sir?"

"Is everything prepared?"

"Yes, sir. Her audio is live, and we're able totrack her movements."

"What about the camera I instructed you to attach to her backpack?"

"I installed that too, sir. It's online now, and you can watch and listen to her actions through the tablet." Max handed the tablet to his superior.

He powered it on and began watching the footage, noting that she was already approaching the base of the mountain. Max noticed the concern on his boss's face. Everyone was aware of how much he cared for his wife,making this decision especially difficult for him.

Alexander remained near the forest, intending to stay close to her. He settled inside the vehicle, observing her progress. Seven hours had passed since she started the climb, and from the sound of her breathing, he could tell how exhausted she was."You could take a break," he muttered to himself, as though she could hear him. She had been walking for hours without resting, and her legs must have been aching by now. He checked how far she had left before reaching the other side of the mountain and saw that she was stilI far from halfway. Worry gnawed at him, his heart leaping each time she almost stumbled. Did he make a mistake in choosing this punishment? He began to regret his decision, but it was too late to turn back now.Lost in his thoughts, he didn't realize when the live feed and audio cut off. When he finally focused back on the tablet, there was no image or sound.Alexander checked the connection, but everything appeared to be in working order. So why couldn't he see or hear her anymore?

His anxiety spiked, and he immediately called out, "Max!"

"Yes, sir," Max responded, rushing over.

"What happened to the audio and video feed?"

"Sir, the weather is calm; there shouldn't be any interference."

"Then why isn't the video or audio working?" Alexander was becoming increasingly agitated.

"I'll fix it right away, sir."
0
Max hurried to check the antenna, but it was functioning properly,which could only mean one thing: either the devices had been disconnected, or they were damaged. But how was he going to tell his boss that?

Alexander exited the car and approached the team. "Have you resolved the issue? Don't you realize she's out there all alone?"

"Sir..." Max hesitated, fear evident in his voice.

Alexander's concern for anything related to his wife was well-known,and now that they'd lost contact with her, Max knew he was in serious trouble.

"Speak!" Alexander demanded, his patience thinning. "Sir, we've lost the signal. The antenna is still working, so it likely means the audio and video equipment on the backpack was damaged or destroyed." Alexander's face paled, his heart pounding in fear of what might have happened to her. In a sudden fit of rage, he grabbed Max by the throat,squeezing as Max struggled for air. But as Alexander realized that if anything happened to her, the blame rested on him, not Max, he released his grip, leaving Max gasping on the ground. The other guards backed away in fear, not wanting to be the next target.

"Should we head up there to search for her?" one of the bodyguards cautiously suggested.

"Get the helicopter here, now!" Alexander commanded,cursing himself for letting his pride and anger push him to this point. They could have gone home together peacefully, but now his actions had led to this crisis.

A few guards immediately drove off to retrieve the helicopter from one of their bases. Alexander gazed anxiously up the mountain.She had climbed far, and if he attempted to scale it himself, he wouldn't reach her in time.His mind raced with fears of what might have befallen her-perhaps she had slipped and taken a hard fall, given how often she had nearly stumbled. The possibilities tormented him, driving him to the brink of madness.

When Ethan heard about the situation, he rushed over with the helicopter.He couldn't believe Alexander had subjected the woman he loved to such a harsh ordeal. He knew what Alexander was capable of, but he never imagined that Lilly would experience the brunt of his ruthlessness. Alexander looked up as the helicopter arrived, the noise of its blades slicing through the air. He walked toward it, bracing against the strong winds generated by the rotors. Max straightened up and trailed closely behind his boss. Alexander climbed into the helicopter, fastening his seatbelt and putting on a helmet. "What were you thinking?" Ethan shouted over the helicopter's roar.

What had he been thinking? Alexander asked himself the same question.

"You left her to tackle that mountain alone. Ifsomething happens to her,she'll never forgive you, and neither will Viola if anything happens to her mother."


"Just get us moving!" Alexander yelled back. Did Ethan think he wasn't already tortured by those thoughts? Losing his family wasn't an option.


Ethan piloted the helicopter to the top of the mountain, and they began their search for Lilly. They scoured the area until darkness fell.

"Alexander, she's nowhere to be found," Ethan said after they'd searched every possible spot with no sign of her.

"That can't be," Alexander shook his head in denial. His Lilly couldn't just vanish.


"Bring the helicopter down," he ordered.

"Alexander, it's too dark-"

"I said bring it down!" he snapped, his agitation growing.

Ethan complied, landing the helicopter on the mountainside. Alexander removed his helmet and unbuckled his seatbelt before stepping out. "Are you sure this is wise?" Ethan asked. "There might be caves in this mountain. She could have fallen into one and lost consciousness," Alexander speculated. Ethan considered this and nodded. "You might be right; we should continue searching."

"Get the men ready. Tell Max to assemble a team of about 200 to search this mountain immediately."


"I'll handle it." Ethan relayed the orders, and soon a large group of men was scouring the mountainside.


Alexander was right about the caves in the area, but none led them to Lilly.
If he combed this entire mnountain and didn't find her, he would lose his sanity. He would blame himself if anything terrible happened to her. What would he say to Viola if her mother wasn't found?

"Lilly, where are you? I'm sorry," he muttered, his voice thick with emotion. He searched the same cave repeatedly but found no trace of her.

"Lilly!" he called out, his voice echoing through the mountains.

He shouted her name over and over, but there was no answer. Ethan watched him sympathetically. "Why are you putting yourself through this?"Ethan asked.

Alexander suddenly remembered Lilly's warning that he would end up hurting himself, and she had been right-he was in agony.

Caleb was furious when he learned what had happened and immediately dispatched his men to join the search. He hadn't anticipated things spiraling out of control; otherwise, he would have intervened. Alexander sat on a large rock, staringblankly into the distance, wishing he could turn back time. His phone rang, and he quickly answered,hoping for good news. It was Viola. Hearing his daughter's voice made his heart ache even more. "Daddly," she said, her sweet voice making his chest tighten.

Alexander swallowed hard, trying to keep his emotions in check so she wouldn't sense anything was wrong. "Yes, darling?"

"Why aren't you home yet? You promised to read me a bedtime story since Mommy's away." Viola blinked her eyes and pouted.

Alexander forced a smile, knowing she was pouting. "I'm sorry,sweetheart.Daddy has some late work to finish and won't be back until tomorrow."

Viola sighed in disappointment. "But you promised," she said, her voice tinged with sadness.

Hearing her upset voice broke his heart. "Since Daddy broke his promise,
Daddy will let Viola decide his punishment. Does that sound fair?"

Viola perked up. "Any punishment?"

"Yes,darling."

"Okay," she said excitedly, already thinking of something.

Hearing her cheerful tone brought a small smile to his face. "Daddy needs to go now.Goodnight,sweetheart."

"Goodnight, Daddy. I love you."

"Daddy loves you too," Alexander replied before ending the call,sinking back into despair. If by tomorrow, Viola didn't see her mother, what would he tell her? It was already the next afternoon, and Lilly was still missing. Peter stormed over and punched Alexander in the face. "How could you do this?!" he shouted at Alexander,who stood motionless.

If it had been anyone else, Alexander wouldn't have stood there and taken the hit. Ethan was shocked-it was the first time he had seen his bosS receive a punch.

"And you allowed him to carry out this plan?!" Peter yelled at his father,who felt humiliated but remained silent, knowing he was also at fault.Had he stopped Alexander, none of this would have happened.

They had people searching the entire mountain and surrounding areas. If she wasn't on the mountain, it meant she had been taken.


Peter paced anxiously, realizing that he had always trusted his daughter's safety to Alexander, only to now discover that she wasn't even safe with her own husband.


Alexander wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth with a handkerchief. "If there's nothing else, I'll continue searching for her," he said, then left the mansion, got into his car, and sped off, ignoring his assistants who were calling after him.

He was on the verge of losing his mind. "Lilly, where are you?"
###Chapter 82
 to check on me, but she hasn't called. Doesn't she want to talk to me?" She looked at him with a sorrowful expression.

Running a hand through his hair, Alexander felt more lost than ever before.He had never been this unsure of what to say.

Viola didn't understand why her father was taking so long to reply.

After carefully considering his words, Alexander finally spoke,"Mommy is somewhere with a poor phone signal, which is why she hasn't been able to call. You know how much she loves you, and she would never miss calling you unless she couldn't."

Little Viola thought it over and then nodded. "Okay."

"Now eat up, and Daddy will read you a bedtime story," Alexander said.

Viola smiled, reassured. "Okay, Daddy," she said, picking up her spoon and starting to eat.

Alexander breathed a sigh of relief.

After dinner, he helped her brush her teeth, tucked her into bed, and read her a bedtime story.


Clara stood outside Viola's bedroom door, sighing quietly. She hoped the madam would be found soon and return home because her absence was weighing heavily on the boss, and it wouldn't be long before Viola felt the impact too. After ensuring Viola was asleep, Alexander kissed her forehead and left the room."Take good care of her. She won't be going to school tomorrow." "Yes, young master," Clara replied, bowing her head.

Alexander leftthe house afterward and met Ethan at one of their bases to discuss new strategies to find her.

"The only logical conclusion now is that she's been taken," Richard said.despite the tension between him and Alexander, knowing he had to support him during Lilly's disappearance.

"Who would dare take her without leaving a trace? Alexander is the most powerful man in the underworld. No one would risk provoking him,"Ethan added.


“I'm just saying we have to consider every possibility. What do you think,Alexander? Do you agree with me?" Richard asked, turning to their friend,who appeared utterly devastated.


Ethan and Richard watched their friend, who looked like his entire world had collapsed.


Suddenly, Ethan had a thought. Given their widespread connections,if someone had taken her, they would have uncovered it by now. If she was injured, perhaps someone from a nearby village had found her,but their men were searching those areas with no success. If she couldn't be found,maybe she was hiding on purpose, using this situation to punish Alexander. Pondering this, Ethan called ou1t,“Alexander?”

“What if Lilly doesn't want to be found?”he suggested. Alexander, who had been lost in thought, snapped his gaze to Ethan.“What are you implying?" “Could it be she left the mountain on her own and is staying hidden to make you regret sending her there?" Alexandler considered it but shook his head. "No, that's not possible.She didn't know I was taking her to the mountain. If she had left, she would have needed help, but she didn't know anyone or have any idea of what I had planned."

“I'm just suggesting we consider the possibility."

Alexander thought again but remained unconvinced. There was no way she could have known his plan.

Then he remembered Lilly had a friend who was a hacker-Jacob. With that thought. Alexander stood up and headed out of the office.

“Alexander, where are you going?" Richard called after him, but he received no reply.

"We should follow him before he does something reckless. He's not thinking straight right now," Ethan said, and the two hurried after him.

Alexander found Max, who was guarding outside.

“Boss,” Max greeted, bowing his head the moment he saw Alexander.

“Hand over your cell phone."

“Huh?”Max was confused. Why did his boss need his phone?

“Do it quíckly," Alexander ordered.

Max pulled out his phone and handed it to him without hesitation. “The password?” Max unlocked the phone and handed it back.
"Did you delete our conversation about the mountain?"

“No.Boss.”

Alexander nodded and headed back inside the base.

Max was still bewildered, not understanding why his phone was taken. As a loyal guard, he had nothing to hide, but he worried he might be in trouble.

Richard and Ethan observed, equally puzzled, but followed Alexander to see what he was up to.

Alexander entered one of their computer rooms and handed the phone to their hackers.

“Check if this phone has been compromised."

“Right away, Boss," the hackers replied, immediately getting to work.

"Alexander, what's going on? You know Max is loyal, right?" Ethan asked,thinking Alexander might be doubting his right-hand man.

“I'm aware.”

"Then why do this?”

“You suggested Lilly might be hiding from me, so I'm checking if Jacob hacked Max's phone to get information about what I planned." “Oh,”Ethan said, nodding in understanding. But he was surprised by how quickly Alexander had put the pieces together. Richard was equally stunned but waited silently to see what would happen."If it turns out you're right, what do you plan to do?" Ethan asked.Would Alexander let it go, or would he make her regret her actions?

“Before you decide anything, remember that this all started because you tried to punish her," Richard reminded him, wanting Alexander to acknowledge his role in the situation.


Alexander sat on the couch, silent, his expression unreadable, leaving Richard and Ethan unsure of what he was thinking.




Meanwhile, Lilly was comfortably settled in front of a television, enjoying an action movie with a large bowl of popcorn and a glass of juice,completely unbothered by her husband's frantic search for her.

Jacob was keeping her updated on Alexander's efforts to find her.According to him, her husband might turn the entire city upside down if he didn't find her soon.


After this, Alexander wouldn't dare try to punish her again. Who orders their loving wife to climb a mountain for hours? Even the seven hours she endured felt like a death sentence.


Lilly had gone hiking before, but this was different; the mountain was treacherous. Her legs had ached terribly, and if Jacob and Michael hadn't arrived in time to get her out, she might have passed out. She was still amazed at how they managed to find a way to climb the mountain and rescue her, Jacob had tracked her location by hacking into Alexander's systems. Occasionally,she glanced at her phone, waiting for Alexander to call. She knew it wouldn't be long before he figured out who might be helping her and reached out to either Jacob, Michael, or Sarah, confident they were in on it. When he did, she would give him a piece of her mind.

She had already told Sarah to give Alexander her new number so he could contact her.

Lilly hated resorting to these measures, but if she didn't, Alexander would continue to think it was acceptable to punish her as he pleased.Despite everything, she missed him terribly-his cuddles at night,his kisses all over her body. She couldn't wait for this to be over so she could return home to him and their daughter, Viola, whom she also missed dearly. She was sure Alexander had told Viola she was on a trip so she wouldn't worry about where her mother was.

Currently, Lilly was staying at a resort about three hours away from the city. The resort was small, luxurious, and discreet, hidden from public view,with its location not even marked on any map. Only the wealthiest of the wealthy seeking seclusion stayed there. Alexander was aware of such places but would have no idea which one she was at unless she told him.

After a few hours, her phone rang, and she smiled,seeing that it was him calling.
###Chapter 83

"Boss, based on what we've uncovered, it's clear the phone was hacked.but the hacker can't be traced,"

Alexander immediately stood up upon hearing this. So, Lilly had known about his plans all along but pretended she didn't?

He clenched his fist. "Max!"

"Yes, boss?" Max quickly entered the room.He had been following closely behind to see what Alexander intended to do with his phone.

"Bring Jacob and Michael here immediately! They must know where she is!"


"Right away,boss."

"Wait," Richard interrupted, stopping Max from leaving.

Alexander shot him a deadly glare. "What do you think you're doing?"


"Calm down,Alexander."

"Calm down? They helped her leave that mountain; they know where she is!" "You know how stubborn those two are. They won't tell you anything.even if you threaten them. You've never gotten along with them, and they don't like you either," Ethan pointed out. Matthew and Michael were fiercely loyal to Lilly. "So what should I do?" Alexander asked, desperate to get his wife back.Her grandfather and father had given him onlya few days to find her,and now Viola was starting to suspect something wasn't right.

"Think about it-Sarah is the only one you get along with. She'll tell you where Lilly is," Richard suggested.

"How do I know she even knows where Lilly is?"

"Because there's no way Lilly would plan something like this and leave Sarah out of it. I'm sureshe knows," Richard replied, and Ethan nodded in agreement.

"All you have to do is ask Sarah-politely," Richard emphasized the"politely," knowing Alexander's usual demeanor.

"Since we're done here, I'll be leaving," Ethan said, turning to go.


"Where are you going?" Alexander demånded.

Ethan gave him a surprised look. "Have you forgotten that I also have a multimillion-dollar company to run?" Alexander had gotten so used to having Ethan around whenever he needed him that he'd forgotten Ethan was the CEO of the Lawrence group of companies.

"Can you blame me? You never seem like someone who's busy,"Alexander remarked dryly.

"I agree," Richard added, nodding. "But how you manage to run your family empire so smoothly and win multiple contracts surprises me."

Ethan smiled. "Seems you've forgotten who you're talking to." "Remind me," Richard said, knowing full well that Ethan was just as sharp as Alexander. But while Alexander juggled three empires-the Kane Corporation, his family's company, and his underworld dealings-Ethan had only one.

Richard was grateful he only had to manage his family's hospitals, which was stressful enough.

"Before I go, good luck gettingLilly back," Ethan said, then left.

"I'll be going too. But please, don't make another mistake. She might do something drastic again," Richard warned before leaving.

After they were gone, Alexander called Sarah. She wasn't expecting his call so soon, but Lilly had predicted he'd find out she left of her own accord.

She answered the call, holding the phone to her ear. "Sarah."

Hearing his voice made her nervous. Even after knowing Alexander for three years as her friend's husband, he still intimidated her.

"Alexander."

"You know why I'm calling,right?"

"Why did you call?"

"Don't play games with me. Tell me where Lilly is, now!" His voice was authoritative.


Sarah didn't like his tone, but she knew who she was dealing with.He wasn't someone she could talk back to. "Lilly didn't give me her location,so I don't know where she is." She was telling the truth; Lilly hadn't shared her location, only her new phone number. "You can't be serious. She must have contacted you when she left." "She did." "Then give me her contact."

"I'll send it." Sarah hung up and sent him the number. She was at work and didn't want to continue the conversation.


Alexander checked his messages and saw the number. He left the room,grabbed his car keys, and headed out.

His bodyguards tried to follow, but he told them he was going alone.He got into his sports car and drove out to the main road, dialing Lilly's number as he went.

When Lilly saw the call, she smiled and let it ring for a while before answering. "Hello," she greeted first.

Alexander pulled his car to the side of theroad.Hearing her voice brought him back to life; he'd felt like a walking dead man until now. His racing heart finally calmed.

"Lilly, where are you?" Alexander asked, surprised by his own calmness.

Lilly was taken aback by how calm he was. She expected him to be shouting but instead, he was composed, which made her smile.

"Somewhere."

"Where? Tell me the location so I can pick you up and bring you home.Viola is asking about you." "Then tell her I went on a trip. Isn't that what you told her before taking me to that mountain?" Alexander was silent. "She hasn't heard from you, so she's starting to suspect." Lilly couldn't believe how calm he was. She hadn't expected this from him.Maybe she had really scared him.

"When you get home, call me back so she can hear my voice. Or better yet.give her my number so she can call me whenever she wants."

Alexander frowned. Was she planning on not coming home?

"You don't want to come home to me?"

"Not yet. I'm still relaxing," Lilly yawned, testing his patience.

"Lilly!" He shouted, his anger finally showing. "Give me your location now!"he ordered.

"This conversation is over," she said, ending the call.
0
She started counting, and in less than ten seconds, he called back. She picked up, "Alexander."

"You hung up on me?"

"Why did you raise your voice? I'll only respond to you if you speak calmly."

Alexander forced himself to stay calm. "Okay, fine. I'm sorry."

She smiled at his apology. "Okay."

"Can you please just tell me your location?" "What if I'm not ready to come home?" Alexander was silentfor a moment, choosing his words carefully. "Then I'Il stay there with you." Lilly hadn't expected him to say that.

"Lilly Blake, haven't you succeeded in turning me into a love-struck fool?"

Lilly was stunned by his statement. Had she really done that?

Seeing she was speechless, he continued, "I won't return home without you."

"You plan on leaving Viola at home alone?"

"I'll take her with me to find you." As he spoke, he had people tracking her location.


"Alexander, you won't find this place unless I tell you." She knew what he was doing.
0
Lilly hung up after saying that, wanting to show him that he could lose her for good if he mistreated her.

Alexander called again, but she didn't pick up. He called several more tímes,growing more agitated each time.

He dialed a different number. "Did you get her location?"

"No, sir. Her location is unknown."

"Didn't you check where the call signal is coming from?"Alexander shouted.


"We did, sir, but it's showing as outer space," the person on the other end replied nervously.

"Outer space?" "Yes, sir. When a call location shows outer space, it means it's untraceable."

Alexander ended the call and was lost in thought. Wherever she was,it wasn't on any map.

She was right--he wouldn't know where she was unless she told him. He had truly underestimated his wife.

He called her again and was relieved when she picked up. He had thought carefully about what to say. He'd wanted to punísh her, but now she was making it clear that if he treated her poorly, she'd leave, and he'd never find her again.

Lilly saw his call. It had been ten minutes since their last conversation, so she was sure he'd figured out he couldn't locate her.

She answered to hear what he had to say.

"Okay, I get it. I'm sorry for what I did. I shouldn't have treated you that way. Please forgive me and come back home."

Lilly remained silent.

"I promise it won't happen again," Alexander added.

Lilly smiled, pleased that he'd admitted his wrongdoing.

"Apology accepted."

Alexander sighed in relief. "Tell me your location."

"Ocean resort," she said then hung up.

Alexander couldn't believe it. He hadn't thought of searching hidden resorts. So that's where she was? He got back in his car and drove to the location, not caring about the distance.


Llly started packing, knowing he'd arrive in about three hours.

Three Hours Later

A gentle knock came on her room door, and she rushed to open it,knowing it was Alexander. The receptionist had already informed her.

Lilly opened the door, and before she could say a word, he hugged her tightly.

Alexander hugged her, inhaling her scent. "God, I've missed you." He had been terrified when he couIdn't find her.

He pulled back to look her over, making sure she was okay before hugging her again. "Please don't disappear on me again, okay?"

Lilly nodded. "I won't."

"Everyone was worried, especially me. I can't bear to lose you," Alexander said,gazing into her eyes before kissing her on the lips and then her forehead.


Lilly kissed him back,having missed his kisses.

People in the rooms across from them smiled at the couple. "They're so in love," a woman said to her friend. "Yes, they are." "They look familiar, though." "Don't you know them?" "Who are they?"

"Alexander Kane and Lilly Blake."

Her friend gasped. "Oh my God. I can't believe it's them."

Lilly smiled as she hugged Alexander. If anyone had told her she'd make Alexander love her this much,she wouldn't have believed it.
###Chapter 84

"Haha ha ha ha ha ha," Caleb laughed heartily when he heard what his granddaughter did. It never crossed his mind that she would do such a thing, but it was clever of her, and he felt proud seeing how she taught her husband a lesson. If he ever tried something funny with her,she would leave him. Although Caleb hadn't stopped Alexander from doing what he wanted, after finding out that he had sent his daughter to climb a mountain for hours, Caleb became furious and thought of ways to deal with the young man.

However, there would be no need for him to handle it, since his granddaughter had already done so. Every time she did something like this, Caleb felt more assured that he made the right choice in making her the heir to the family business. With the lesson she taught her husband,he wouldn't dare try something like that again. She had shown him that if he treated her love as worthless, she would leave. This was how she would make good decisions in business as well.

"Father, did you hear the news?" Peter walked into the study room.

"Yes, Victor just told me that Lilly has been found, and it was all her doing. She taught her husband a good lesson," Caleb said proudly.

"Really? Is that all you have to say about the fact that she put everyone in a panic?" Peter couldn't believe his father.


Caleb looked at his son. "Yes, we were all afraid and worried that something bad had happened to her."


"And what about the part where you planned to retaliate? You were ready to attack your enemies, thinking they took your granddaughter. It seems you don't realize the kind of problems her disappearance would have  caused."

Caleb looked at his son with a calm expression. "Which is why she showed up after a day, because she didn't want any of that to happen. If Lilly was thoughtless,she would have stayed hidden for days, but she knew what that would cause."

Peter walked out of the study and went to the garden to call Lilly.

Lilly was driving back home with Alexander when she got a call from her father. Victor must have given him her new number since she had just finished talking to him.

"Father."

"What were you thinking, Lilly? Did you know how worried we were?"

"I'm sorry, Father, that I made you worried, but it's all over now."

Peter sighed. "I just hope this will be the first and last time.You should know how your grandfather is and also how Alexander handles issues.Those men can be very ruthless. Just imagine how the whole city would have turned upside down if you hadn't shown up. A lot of people would have been affected."What her father said was true: a lot of people would have been affected if Alexander had decided to handle things more drastically. She looked at Alexander, who was driving with all his attention on the road. "I'm sorry,Father. There won't be a second time."Peter sighed. "Please take care." "I will." Lilly hung up the call.Alexander didn't say anything regarding the call and just kept on driving.

They arrived home, and she went straight to Viola's room.

Viola was busy doingher homework with the help of her nanny when the room door was pushed open.

Her eyes went to the door, and she jumped up from her seat when she saw her mother.

"Mummy!!" she shouted excitedly as she ran to hug her mother.

Lilly picked her up and swung her around. "I missed my baby so much."

"I missed you too,Mummy."

Lilly planted kisses all over her face.

Viola jumped happily in her mother's arms. "Mummy," she looked at her mother.


"Yes,baby?"

"Can you please stop going on trips?" she said, revealing what had been on her mind for a long time.


Lilly nodded. "No more trips, baby, no more. Mummy is going to be here every day to read you bedtime stories. And if we ever go on a trip, it will be you, me, and Daddy together."Viola jumped happily and kissed her mother's forehead. "Yay! I love you,Mummy!" "Mummy loves you too."Alexander stood close to the door and smiled at both of them. These two people were his everything, and he didn't want to lose either of them. He was ready to kill anyone who dared to hurt them.

The following day, the family of three had breakfast, and Alexander left first since he had a lot of meetings to attend in two branches of the company and was launching a new product.

Lilly and Viola left later, as she was going to drop Viola at school before heading to the office.

Other kids and parents who came to drop their children at school stared at the luxury car that drove into the school premises. They immediately knew the owner of the car since she was the only person who drove it in the whole city.

Alexander was very particular about cars, which is why he made sure that the car Lilly drove and the car that took Viola to school were the only ones of their kind in the entire country. This way, his wife and child would stand out from others.


The car stopped, and the bodyguard opened the back seat. Lilly stepped out first, and the other mothers who came to drop off their kids were in awe of her beauty. This wasn't the first time they had seen her, but every time they did, they were always astonished because she just got more beautiful and enchanting with each passing day, which explained why Alexander didn't joke about her. Lilly helped her daughter get down from the car by holding her small hands. Viola got down and smiled adorably at her mother. "Thank you, Mummy." 
"You're welcome."

"Awww, she's so polite," other parents admired her, which made their kids frown.Why would their parents admire another child instead of them?

Lilly kissed her on the cheek and on her forehead before handing her over to her teacher.


"Bye,Mummy."

"Bye, my baby. I will come to pick you up when you finish school."

"Okay." Viola was so happy; she couldn't wait to go to her mother's company after school.

Lilly stood there and waited for her to get to the school building before turning to get into the car. That was when one of the socialite women who came to drop off her kid at school suddenly approached her.

"Good morning, Mrs. Kane," she greeted, making Lilly turn and look at her. "Good morning," Lilly replied but didn't recognize who she was. Since returning to Country A and marrying Alexander, she hadn't mingled or hung out with other socialites because she knew how they behaved.Although she couldn't place the woman standing in front of her, from the way she dressed and her temperament, Lilly knew she was one of those socialite women who always gossip and spread false rumors in her circle of friends. "It's Mrs. Wilson," she smiled as she proudly called her husband's last name. Her husband's family owned chain stores around the country,so they were very rich and popular among the elites. She expected Lilly to know her husband's last name since she was someone in the business world and must have done business with him before, but the casual look on Lilly's face told her otherwise.

Lilly tried to recall the name, maybe she had heard it somewhere, but it didn't ring a bell. "Hi, Mrs. Wilson, is there anything I can do for you?"she asked politely.

Mrs. Wilson was disappointed but smiled to cover it up. "My chíld also attends this school and is in the same class as yours, so I was hoping we could get along, maybe hang out one of these days. What do you think?"she asked, anticipating her response.

Lilly smiled. "As much as I would love to hang out, I can't because I am busy with so many things. You should know I run a company and how stressful it is. I don't have time for things like that since I'm too busy."

Mrs. Wilson frowned inwardly. Was Lilly trying to say she was jobless?She scoffed inwardly. She didn't think Mrs. Kane could be this proud.Although she came from a wealthy family and married into another rich one, what made her think she could act this way? She thought to herself and scoffed.


"Alright then," she pulled out her card and handed it to Lilly. "This is my business card. My number is there, so you can call me or come to my restaurant just in case you change your mind." Lilly looked at the card and smiled. "Okay then, I will leave now." Mrs.Wilson had given her the card to show that she wasn't jobless and ran an expensive restaurant. Lilly shook her head and smiled at her attitude. Lilly got into the car, and the driver reversed before driving out of the school premises. Mrs. Wilson stood and watched as the car drove off, then frowned."Such a bitch." The truth was that almost all the young ladies in the elite world hated Lilly when they heard she was married to Alexander. Before they got married, they had all wanted to be Alexander's wife by any means necessary, doing all sorts of things to get his attention. They even debated among themselves who would win his heart. Alexander was the most sought-after bachelor at that time, so much so that some planned to drug him just to get into his bed. But the man was too tough and difficult,and he disliked every one of them, leading them to conclude he must be homosexual-until they heard the news that he was married on the day of the Lawrence family's head birthday party three years ago.

Mrs. Wilson just wanted to get close to Lilly since doing so would benefit her and her husband in business.


As soon as Lilly's car was seen driving out of the school premises, another car was parked a short distance

away from the school.

Inside the vehicle sat a woman with a scarf and glasses on. Her eyes were fixed on the school with a deadly look on her face.

"Ma'am, are you sure we can do this today?"

"Today is the day. It has to be today," the young lady said. "Alexander Kane's people are scattered everywhere; they're all around this place. Do you think we will succeed in taking the child? " The young lady gave her subordinate a cold look. "Yes, this is something we have been planning for two years now, and today is just perfect.Yesterday would have been more ideal sincehe was busy looking for Lilly, but the man was too smart not to have sent his daughter to school yesterday. So it has to be today, and today it shall be," she said with all seriousness.

The only way to get back at them was to take what was most precious to them-their precious child.
###Chapter 85

Six hours later, as school let out, parents arrived to pick up their children.Viola eagerly prepared to leave, excited to join her mother at work. She aspired to be just like her, a confident and capable businesswoman.

Ms. Amster noticed her enthusiasm and smiled, asking if she was ready to go. Viola quickly confirmed. Ms. Amster, always cautious, personally escorted Viola to ensure that the right person picked her up. Given Viola's powerful parents, any mistake could cost Ms. Amster her job and possibly even lead to the school's closure. Although she cared for all her students,she was particularly vigilant with Viola, not out of favoritism, but out of fear of the consequences if something went wrong, especially considering Viola's father's reputation.

"Alright, hold my hand," Ms. Amster instructed, and Viola gladly did so,eager to leave. Howeyer, they were interrupted by another teacher, Mr.Harold, who usually taught a dlifferent class.

"Mr. Harold, what are you doing here? I thought you had left?" Ms.Amster asked.


"I was about to, but the principal called me back. She mentioned a couple who want to enroll their child in your class, and she asked to see you," Mr.Harold replied, glancing at Viola. Ms. Amster was puzzled. Who enrolls their child at the end of the school day? Such things are usually handled in the morning or at the beginning of a term. However, thinking that Viola's mother must already be waiting,she decided to drop Viola off first. "I'll take Viola to her mother and then see the principal," Ms. Amster said.But Mr. Harold insisted, "The principal is about to leave, and the couple is in a hurry. I can take Viola to her mother for you."

Ms. Amster hesitated, feeling uneasy, but after some back and forth, she reluctantly agreed. As Ms. Amster handed Viola over, she couldn't shake a feeling of dread. Viola didn't seem to like Mr. Harold much either and looked disappointed as they parted.

"Come on, Viola, it's time to go," Mr. Harold said with a smirk, leading Viola away. As they neared the exit, Viola spotted her mother waiting outside and smiled, but her mother couldn't see her through the tinted glass.

"Why aren't we going to my mommy?" Viola asked,confused.

Mr. Harold bent down to Viola's level, his voice dripping with malice. "This will be the last time you see your mother," he said, smirking. Viola,alarmed, tried to bite him, but before she could react further, Mr. Harold injected something into her arm, causing Viola to pass out. Just before losing consciousness. Viola caught a glimpse of her mother and whispered,"Mummy," as tears filled her eyes.

Mr. Harold then carried Viola through a hidden exit,leaving the school unnoticed. He had taken the teaching job a year ago, all for this moment.

Meanwhile,Lilly anxiously checked her watch. Fifteen minutes had passed since she'd been standing outside, waiting for Viola. The delay was unusual, and with each passing minute,her impatience grew.

Finally, Ms. Amster emerged, but Viola was not with her. Panic set in as Lilly rushed toward her.

"Good morning. Mrs. Kane," Ms. Amster greeted her nervously. 
"Where is Viola?" Lilly demanded, skipping the pleasantries.

Ms. Amster froze in shock. "Viola? I... I sent her with another teacher to meet you."

"What teacher? I haven't seen anyone with Viola," Lilly said, her voice filled with rising fear.

Ms. Amster's heart sank. She had handed Viola over to Mr. Harold,trusting him due to his year of service at the school. But now, Lilly's panic confirmed that something had gone terribly wrong.

"Where is this teacher?" Lilly demanded again.

"He was supposed to bring Viola to you," Ms. Amster stammered,trembling.

Without waiting for more explanations, Lilly marched into the school.shouting for Viola as she searched every corner, Samuel and Pedro trailing behind her. But there was no sign of Viola or Mr. Harold.

When Samuel and Pedro informed their boss of Víola's disappearance,Lilly was beyond furious. She slapped Ms. Amster in a fit of rage.screaming, "You had one job, and you failed!"

Ms. Amster wept, filled with regret and fear for the consequences. Where could Mr. Harold have taken Viola? Lilly, desperate and terrified, called Jacob, her voice shaking with tears."Jacob, Viola is missing," she sobbed. Jacob and Michael were stunned. Viola had been taken, but by whom? As the news spread, Alexander, who had been away on a business trip, immediately canceled all his meetings and took a private jet back.Enraged and desperate, he made several calls, mobilizing the police, the army,and his personal security team to find his daughter.

James,hisassistant. handed him the information on Mr. Harold. It turned out that he was an orphan and an ex-convict who had forged his identity to get the teaching job.

Alexander's anger knew no bounds. "Shut down the school permanently!"he ordered, and within minutes, the school was closed by the education minister, with no protest from the families, given the seriousness of the situation.


As the city was thrown into chaos over Viola's disappearance, every available resource was used to search for her. But despite all efforts,it was clear that the kidnappers had planned this meticulously, leaving no trace behind.
###Chapter 86

The entire news media, both on television and online,was abuzz with the story of Viola's abduction, making it the day's top headline. Picturesof Viola and her kidnapper, Harlord, were everywhere, accompanied by a generous reward offer for anyone who could provide information leading to their capture. The disappearance of Viola quickly became the concern of not just the city but also surrounding areas.

People were shocked and wondered who would have the audacity to kidnap Alexander Kane's daughter. They were confident, however, that whoever was behind it would be caught, given Alexander's extensive influence.

In a concealed hideout on the outskirts of the city, a woman sat in a chair.watching the news coverage with a smug expression.

"Tsk, tsk," she muttered, glancing over at Viola, who was fast asleep on a nearby bed.“Your parents are going out of their minds searching for you,little princess. If only they knew they won't find you unless we decide otherwise," she said with a chuckle.

The sedative they had given Viola kept her in a deep sleep, and she wouldn't wake until the mnorning. The woman was pleased with how their plan was unfolding. By morning, Alexander and Lilly would be fraintic.and soon enough, they would understand exactly who they were dealing with. This scheme had been in the works for two years, and everything was going according to plan.

************
Night had fallen, but no one had left the school where Viola was last seen.Everyone stayed close to Lilly, who had been crying and refusing to leave the cold floor. Peter watched his daughter with growing concern.

As soon as Alexander landed, he rushed to the school.

“Alexander, you're here at last," Ethan said upon seeing him.

"Where's Lilly?" Alexander asked, his eyes searching the area.

“She's in Viola's classroom. She hasn't left the floor since it happened."

Alexander hurried into the school building and made his way to Viola's classroom, where he found Lilly sitting on the cold floor, crying.

Seeing her like this broke his heart. He knew one of them had to be strong.and it had to be him. As much as Viola's kidnapping tore him apart, he knew he had to hold it together for both of them.
0
Alexander walked over to her and sat down beside her on the floor.

Lilly looked up and saw that it was Alexander.

“Alexander," she whispered.

He pulled her into his-arms, gently rubbing her back. “I promise you, I will find her," he vowed.

“But what if they hurt her? I won't be able to bear it," she said through her tears.


“They won't dare. They've kidnapped her, which means they have a purpose. Sooner or later, they'll make contact, and we'll trace them." “But what if they're somewhere you can't trace?" Lilly asked, recalling how she once hid from him, and he couldn't find her. Alexander understood what she meant. “This time, I will find them. I'll track them down no matter where they are in the world, I promise. I have a contact,someone who can locate anyone, anywhere. I almost called him when you disappeared, but I didn't when I realized you were just hiding.But this time, I will use every resource at my disposal to find them," he assured her.


Lilly nodded and hugged him back, seeking warmth from his embrace.though her tears continued to fall.

"The floor is cold, my love. You'll get sick,Alexander said gently.

"I don't care."

"If you get sick, how will you help look for Viola? She won't be happy to return to a mother who's unwell.”


Hearing this, Lilly immediately stood up. Alexander was right-Viola would be heartbroken to come back to a sick mother.

Alexander sighed in relief when she finally stood. Her grandfather and everyone else had been trying to get her off the floor, but she had refused,insisting she would stay there until Viola was found.


“Let's go home and rest," Alexander suggested.

"No," Lilly shook her head. "I can't go home, not while Viola is missing."

Alexander knew he couldn't convince her to go home, but he had to get her out of the cold. "Alright, let's at least get into the car so you can warm up.”


Lilly resisted, insisting on staying, but Alexander gently picked her up,noticing she was barefoot, and carried her to the car. Despite her protests, he placed her inside and joined her.

"Let me out, Alexander," she pleaded, but he shook his head.

"No,you're freezing. You need to warm up," he said softly.He knew he had to stay composed to take care of her.

"Drive to the other estate," he instructed the chauffeur.

As the car drove away from the school, those who had stayed behind were relieved that Alexander had managed to get Lilly to leave.

Caleb, feeling the weight of the situation, decided to head to the police station.“Take me to the station," he instructed James, who quickly got the car ready.


Peter, sensing his father's determinatioń, insisted on going with him.“I'm coming with you," he said, knowing they were headed to interrogate the school staff.


Caleb nodded, and they both got into the car and left.

Grandma Helen, whose health had been deteriorating, had already gone home.

Outside the school, reporters wereeager to cover the story. As Alexander's car drove out, they rushed to get a statement, but the tinted windows concealed who was inside. Alexander directed the chauffeur to drive to one of their newer estates,a futuristic development constructed by his company. The estate's design featured sleek lines and bold geometric shapes, creating a visually striking aesthetic inspired by nature, technology, and contemporary art. The car stopped in front of the largest mansion in the estate, set apart from the others. Alexander got out first and then carried Lilly inside. As they approached the front door, the lights automatically illuminated, and Alexander used his fingerprint to unlock the door.

Lilly rested her head on Alexander's chest, her thoughts consumed by worry for Viola. Was her daughter okay? Were they treating her well? Was she cold? She was only three years old, and the thought of her daughter suffering broke Lilly's heart.


Alexander had planned to bring both Viola and Lilly to this house,but now he was glad he'd decided to bring Lilly here first. He used the elevator to take them to the second floor, where the calming atmosphere of the room might help her relax.


He placed Lilly on the bed and lay down beside her, wrapping his arms around her. The room was warm, thanks to the heater, and Alexander hoped it would provide some comfort.

"We can't just stay here, Alexander. Viola is missing. We should be out there looking for her," Lilly protested.

"We aren't just sitting idle. We're waiting for news from the hackers who are trying to trace the kidnapper,” Alexander reassured her. “You're freezing. I want you to warm up and eat something."

“No," she shook her head. "I need to be out there searching for Viola."

"And we will," Alexander promised. Lilly moved away from his embrace and looked at him with determination. “Promise me that when you find them, you'll let me be there, and you'll let me take care of them myself," she demanded. Alexander didn't want her to take such a dark path, but he knew she wouldn't relent. He couldn't deny her now, even though he didn't want her to follow through with it.

“Lilly," he began, but she interrupted him.

"No, Alexander. Promise me," she insisted.

Seeing the pain in her eyes, Alexander reluctantly nodded. "I promise,"he said, knowing it was a promise he would struggle to keep.

Satisfied,Lilly snuggled back into his arms, resting her head on his chest. “You need to eat something," he urged again.

Lilly nodded, realizing she needed to stay strong for her daughter, even if she didn't feel like eating.

Alexander stood up. "Stay here, okay?"he said.

Lilly agreed, and Alexander left the room to go to the kitchen downstairs.He had made sure the fridge was stocked before they arrived. Alexander quíckly prepared some porridge and was about to head back upstairs when his phone rang.

Seeing that it was James, he answered immediately. “Any news?”

"Yes,boss," James replied."We found out that Harlord served five years in prison before being released two years ago. During her time in prison,she was cellmates with Kate, and they were very close."“Kate?” Alexander repeated, surprised. He had kept a close watch on Kate and her mother since they were imprisoned. Two years ago,he had them separated,placing Kate in one prison and her mother in a more secure facility. “Yes,boss,"James confirmed.

Alexander was stunned. Could Kate have orchestrated this from prison?But how? There had been no reports of her escaping.

"I want you to verify if Kate is still in prison and to find out if she's had any significant outside contact," Alexander ordered.

“Right away, boss."James replied.

Alexander ended the call and turned around, only to fnd Lilly standing there with raised eyebrows. She must have overheard part of the conversation, and the last thing he wanted was for her to worry about Kate as well.

“Did I hear you mention Kate?” Lilly asked, her tone sharp.

Alexander couldn't deny it. “Yes,” he admitted.

Lilly walked closer, her expression hardening. “Is she involved in this? If she is, I'll handle her myself.”

"We don't know yet, but we're looking into it,” Alexander replied cautiously.

Lilly wasn't going to take any chances.

“Let me handle her," she demanded. “No,” Alexander said firmly. “This is my fighat, and I won't let you get involved.” But Lilly refused to back down. “This is about our daughter, and I will handle whoever is involved in her kidnapping.” The steel in her voice made it clear that she wouldn't be swayed.
###Chapter 87

"I have to see her in jail and confront her."

“No.”

"I need to look her in the eye and ask if she had anything to do with Viola's kidnapping," tears streamed down her face.


Kate despised her and always wanted to be in Alexander's life. If anyone would do this, it would be either her or her mother.


“I've already reached out to that friend of mine. He'll track them down eventually; there's no need for a confrontation."

“How can we be sure he'll find them in time? I need to find my daughter quickly. and if confronting Kate in prison might lead to answers, I'm willing to do it," she declared. A mother's desperation for her child knows no bounds; she would go to any lengths for her daughter. Alexander understood this and could see her desperation, so he knew the only option was to let her proceed. Otherwise, she might act behind his back, and he didn't want that.

“Alright.we can go tomorrow."

Lilly hugged him. "Thank you.”

The next morning, they prepared and headed to the prison,which was about four hours from the city. It would be a long journey. Alexander made occasional calls about any updates, but there was nothing.He realized that confronting Kate might indeed be the best course of action. Meanwhile, in one of Caleb's hideouts, two women were bound with ropes-Amster and the principal. Caleb had taken it upon himself to bring them there and extract the truth from them. He wasn't taking any chances;his great-granddaughter had to be found.

Peter supported his father's actions because his granddaughter was involved.

Caleb picked up a hot blade and approached Amster.

“Please, no, I beg you," Amster cried. “I don't know anything!"

She screamed as the blade was pressed against her skin. The pain was excruciating, and it would surely leave a scar. Caleb continued the torture,and when he got nothing from her, he moved on to the next person and did the same.


Peter couldn't bear to watch any longer, so he left the room. Caleb continued until both women passed out.

Caleb had been informed that Lilly and Alexander were on their way to confront Kate in prison. If it turned out that Kate was involved, he wouldn't hesitate to kill her, even if she was his granddaughter. Bella would be another person he intended to eliminate, as she was surely involved as well. When Sarah heard what had happened, she took the next available flight to H City to be with Lilly during this crucial time. It had been difficult to get permission from her superiors at work, but she explained that she was a friend of Lilly Kane, and their child had been kidnapped. Her superiors allowed her to go, knowing the significance of her connections. Lilly received a message from Sarah.Sarah: "I just landed." Lilly:"Okay."

Sarah:"Where are you?"

Lilly: "I'm on my way to the prison to see Kate."

Sarah: "The prison? Why? Is there something I don't know about?"

Lilly: "Yes, we found out that Harlord was Kate's cellmate before she was released. We're going there to see if she had anything to do with Viola's disappearance."

Sarah: "Really?"

Lilly: "Yes."

Sarah: "Please be careful. I'm glad Alexander is with you."

Lilly:"I will."

Sarah: "I'll just head to Jacob and Micheal to see if I can help."

Lilly: "Thanks."

Lilly logged out and leaned her head against the car window as they drove to the prison. They were about two hours away from the city, with another two hours to gobefore reaching the prison. Alexander's heart ached seeing her like this. He was in as much pain as she was. The absence of their daughter shattered him; he missed his little girl terribly. But seeing Lilly like this made his heart break even more.What he wanted most was for their family to be whole again. Alexander moved her away from the window and held her close to him. Lilly rested her head on his chest. "Who were you chatting with?"

"Sarah,"she replied.

“What did she say?"


"She's here in Aurora City. She's going to meet with Jacob and Micheal to see what she can do to help.”

“Okay,” Alexander said, kissing her forehead.

An hour before reaching the prison, both Alexander's and Lilly's phones started ringing. Lilly was asleep at first, but the sound of the phone woke her up.


Alexander checked his phone and saw that James was calling. At the same time,Ethan's call came in as well.

Lilly received a call from Jacob. She decided not to answer and let Alexander take his cal first. It felt strange that their phones rang simultaneously.

“You should answer Ethan's call.”

Alexander answered and put the call on speaker.

“Alexander, where are you?” From Ethan's tone, they knew the news wasn't good.

Lilly's heart skipped a beat, fearing the worst. Had something bad happened to her daughter? Had the kidnappers done something to her? Seeing how scared Lilly was, Alexander considered taking the call off speaker to talk to Ethan privately, but Lilly stopped him. "Let me hear what he has to say," she pleaded.

Alexander sighed. “Ethan, what happened?"

"Are you on your way to the prison right now?"

“Yes.”

"I just received information that some inmates escaped from prison an hour ago, and there's no trace of them."

Alexander and Lilly exchanged glances.

Lilly immediately thought of Kate.

“Ethan,did they reveal who escaped?”

“Yes, and Kate was one of them."

Lilly looked at Alexander.

"Where are you now,Ethan?”

"I just left the office. I was planning to come to you."

"I'll meet you at the base," Alexander said, ending the call. He was shocked that Kate and the others had managed to escape. Aside fromn the prison'ssecurity, he had his own people guarding it as well.

"Turn the car around and head to the base," Alexander instructed.Jack turned the car around and headed back to the base. Lilly was lost in thought, trying to connect the dots. First,her daughter was kidnapped, and now Kate had escaped. She wondered if the two were related. Alexander held her close. Now that Kate had escaped, Lilly wasn't safe either, "Don't worry; they'll catch her."

Their problems had just doubled. Now they had two urgent matters to deal with: finding their daughter and locating Kate before she could do something terrible.


Lilly's phone rang again. She checked the callerID but saw an unknown number.

Alexander noticed too. The number looked strange.

Lilly immediately answeredand put the call on speaker, thinking it might be the kidnappers calling about Viola.

The person on the other end remained silent.

When the caller didn't speak, Lilly decided to break the silence.

“Who is this?”

The person chuckled.

“Take a guess.”

Lilly's face turned pale at the sound of the voice. Even after so many years,she would never forget that voice.

Alexander couldn't recognize it, but from Lilly's expression, he knew she had an idea who it was. “Kate?” “Hah! Hahaha!” Kate laughed loudly, Alexander frowned.

"You're good at guessing. Too bad I had to escape before you could visit me in prison."

How did she know they were coming to the prison?

"Kate,where are you?"

"Somewhere you'll never find me," Kate said coldly. "Do you know how long I've been planning thisescape?"

"We'll find you, and when we do, you're dead," Alexander said.

Hearing Alexander's voice made Kate pause. She hadn't expected him to be with Lilly. She had thought Lilly would come alone to see her in prison.She had really missed his voice-a man she had wished to have but couldn't because Lilly had taken him from her. She hated Lilly with all her heart, and part of her escape plan was to kill her. Even if she couldn't have Alexander in the end, she would be satisfied knowing that Lilly didn't get her happily ever after.

“Kate?”Lilly called when she noticed the silence. "Kate, go back to prison,or I'll make sure you get a death sentence this time," Lilly threatened, and she meant it.

Kate couldn't hold back her laughter. "Are you sure you want me back in prison? Because if I do, it'll be over for someone you care about." Alexander frowned at the statement. His people were already tracking the call. Lilly didn't understand what shemeant."What do you mean?" Kate smiled as she walked towards the child sitting on the bed, softly crying.

"Tsk tsk tsk. Guess what? Escaping from prison wasn'tthe only thing I've been planning for the past two years. Want to know what else I succeeded in?”


"What are you saying?" Lilly clenched her fists.

"Hold on." Kate moved the phone away from her ear and placed it near Viola, who was crying.

"Say hello to your mommy."

Alexander and Lilly's faces turned pale at Kate's words. Tears welled up in Lilly's eyes. and she gripped the phone tightly.

"Mummy!” Viola cried, calling out for her mother.

Lilly covered her mouth in shock. It was really her daughter-her worst fears had come true.


“Viola!"she muttered.

"Viola!" Alexander called, equally shocked. He couldn't believe it-Kate had planned all this.

Viola heard her father's voice, which made her cry even more.“Daddy,Mommy!"she wept. The place was terrifying, filled with scary people. Lilly burst into tears. Kate placed the phone back to her ear and smiled in satisfaction when she heard Lily crying. "You should cry more because this is just the beginning.”“Please leave her alone; she is just a child," Lily pleaded.

Kate smiled. "Stay tuned and wait for my call. I'll send the location soon,but before that, you have to decide between her life or your own."

Even if she had to die, Lily would do anything to save her child. She knew that Kate's real target was her.


"Just send the location. I'm ready to give my life for that of my child,"Lily declared.


Kate smiled. “Brave of you," she said, then frowned.“But I don't plan on making your death easy. It will be slow and painful.”

###Chapter 88

“I won't make your end easy, Lily. It will be prolonged and excruciating."Kate declared with a sinister grin.

“Just promise me you'lllet her go," Lily insisted.

“I can't promise that because we're not close. Guess what?" Kate said.

“What?”Lily asked.

“I have another surprise for you. I have an accomplice who wants to see Alexander's downfall. Start guessing until my next call. Bye for now," Kate replied. “Goodbye," Kate said, cutting the call.
"Wait!” Liy shouted, but the line was already dead. Despite not desiring Alexander's ruin since she cared for him, Lily had to agree to the plan because she needed the support and resources of the person behind it to escape confinement and execute her scheme. They had agreed to stay out of each other's plans; Lily was her target, but Alexander was his.

Lily and Alexander exchanged shocked glances at Kate's revelation.Who could be plotting against Alexander?


Alexander could think of many potential enemies due to his numerous rivals.


"What are you talking about, Kate? Please, tell me!" Lily begged. It was one thing for Kate to target her, but the thought of Alexander being part of the scheme heightened herfear.
###Chapter 88
Kate smiled in satisfaction and sat on the bed. "Aww, even when you cry,you're so endearing, and so clever for your age," Kate remarked, though her expression turned to a frown.


Upon arriving at the hideout after escaping prison, she learned about the little girl's attempt to flee. The CCTV footage showed Lily's daughter trying to escape by reading the signs on the door. No one expected a three-year-old to be so literate and resourceful, underestimating her abilities.

Kate should have anticipated this, considering the child was the offspring of Alexander Kane and Lily Blake. After her failure to escape, the child cried, realizing her only chance was if her parents came to rescue her.

“Get out of my sight," Kate said sternly, wiping her own tears.She regretted showing her emotions during the call; it would only worry her parents more.

Kate was surprised. "Wow, you have your father's temperament. It's somewhat endearing to see a bit of him in you,” she said with a smile that soon shifted to anger. She seizedthe child roughly and dragged her closer.

"Let me go!" the child screamed, tears streaming down her face.

“Look at me," Kate demanded, lifting her chin. “If your mother doesn't come to save you, you're done for," she warned before shoving the child away.

Kate then approached Rosa, her trusted friend, who had been supporting her since her prison escape, before another ally joined her cause. "Rosa, I need you to stay here and monitor her. She's quite clever; if she escapes again, we might not catch her," Kate instructed. "I'll stay and watch over her. We're in this together. All I want is for you to get your revenge and then free your mother later," Rosa replied.

Kate smiled and hugged her. “What would I do without you? To think you've been financing this project... I don't know how to repay you."

"The only way you can repay me is by being happy," Rosa said.

Kate smiled and nodded. "I know Rosa cares deeply for her. After this, I'll make sure to repay her kindness."



************


The news of Kate's escape and her role in the child's kidnapping alarmed everyone. Caleb began reaching out to old allies for assistance, recognizing the need for all the help he could get.

Grandma Helen, weakened both physically and emotionally, had been praying at the temple since the child's disappearance.


Alexander's team struggled to locate Kate, increasing his anxiety. Despite becoming a powerful figure in the underworld, he had numerous enemies who desired his position. With his newfound vuInerabilities-Lily and their child Viola-his foes had seized an opportunity. The person aiding Kate must be among those wishing to bring him down. He was prepared to face their trap if it meant saving hisdaughter.

Alexander and Lily arrived at his underground headquarters,his most secretive base. Lily, seeing it for the first time, marveled at its size and the array of prison and torture equipment. “I like this place; it's enormous and has various kinds of equipment," she said. Her tears had ceased as she came to terms with her adversary. Alexander, having contacted his friend for assistance, prepared for their next steps.Although Lily was anxious for their child and Alexander's safety,Alexander was resolute to protect both.

He guided Lily to the changing room, filled with combat gear.He hadn't anticipated bringing her to this place, but they were preparing for battle.

Sarah,Jacob, and Michael had also arrived, ready to assist. It was a war,and they needed all the help they could get.

Lily chose the darkest, most formidable bodysuit with leather straps and a half-face mask from the options Alexander provided.

Alexander approved her choice. “Badass,” he said.

Lily managed a faint smile.

Alexander equipped her with a gun holster and loaded weapons.“They're all loaded. Shoot when necessary," he instructed.


Lily nodded, and Alexander fastened her bulletproof vest before she donned the bodysuit. Despite his precautions, he was anxious about her safety since she would confront Kate first.

“I'm really worried about your safety. I didn't think I'd ever feel this afraid," Alexander admitted.


Lily could see his anxiety mirrored her own. “I wish you didn't have to go;I'd rather handle it alone," she said."Not with Viola in their hands and their intent on taking me down. I can't stay idle," Lily responded. “Tonight is the night of battle. We must retrieve our child. We'll get Viola back," Alexander assured, embracing Lily tightly.

"We will get Viola back. I'll make sure of it," Alexandder promised.
 ###Chapter 89

Alexander kissed her forehead. "Everything will work out."

Lily nodded.

"Boss, she's calling." Max rushed into the dressing room to inform them.

Alexander and Lily followed him to the monitor room.

Lily's cell phone was handed to her, and she answered, placing it to her ear. Everyone stood close by in silence, able to hear the conversation as the phone was connected to a device that amplified it.

"Hello,Kate."

Kate smiled. "I appreciate your patience in waiting for my call."

"Justtell me the location. I don't have time for small talk."

Kate laughed. "You should lose the attituade. It won't end well for you if you don't," she warned.

Lily sighed. "I'm sorry,just tell me,please."

"That's better." Kate turned to glance at the man behind her,holding a glass of whiskey.

"Come to the forest on the eastern side of the city with Alexander only.When you arrive, I'll call you back," Kate said, then hung up.

"Forest?" Lily barely finished her thought before the call ended.

Lily looked at everyone.

"We heard," Ethan said. "She's clever. She expects you to come with just Alexander, but she didn't give an exact location to ensure you're alone before directing you further."

"From what I can see, there's no house in the forest," Jacob said,checking his system.

"You won't find one. It's underground, like this base," Alexander explained.

The others agreed.

"Makes sense," Michael added.

"Let's go, Lily. We'll take my sports car," Alexander said,holding her hand as they started out. He was suddenly so calm that it surprised everyone.

"Wait, you can't just go without a plan," Alexander said.

"And who says we don't have one?" Lily asked, meeting their gazes.

"We're getting our child back today, no matter what," she added.
 
No one in the room knew the plan they had made. Only Lily knew who Alexander had contacted to get Kate's location.Unbeknownst to them, beyond the hackers in the room trying to track the conversation with Kate, others had already pinpointed the location. But unlike their team, who hadn't succeeded, those people would be ready to strike once Alexander and Lily entered to face Kate and whoever else was after Alexander.Alexander and Lily left the base, got into the sports car, and sped off, heading east.

The sports car was so fast they arrived in just an hour.

After an hour, they reached the forest on the eastern side. They parked on the road and entered the forest, wearing boots to navigate faster.

When they ventured deeper into the woods. Lily's phone rang.

She answered immediately; there must be a camera somewhere watching them.

"Kate," Lily said.

"I like how you follow instructions," Kate said.

They had already checked the perimeter and confirmed Lily was with no one else except Alexander.

"Just tell me the exact spot."

"Calm down, you're too impatient."

"You can't expect me to be calm when my child is with you,can you?"

"Ha ha ha ha ha ha," Kate laughed loudly. "I love that you understand what I'm capable of."

"I do, so just tell me the exact place."

"You're eager to die, aren't you?" "If it means saving my child, then yes," Lily responded. Kate turned to look at Viola, who was listening to the conversation between Lily and her mother. "Guess who's listening, Viola. She wants to 
cry,hearing how much her mommy loves her."

"Viola," Lily called as tears rolled down her cheeks.

"Mummy," Viola said.

"Dad and I are coming, okay? Don't be scared," Alexander assured her.

"Okay, Daddy," Viola replied.

They both felt relieved knowing nothing had happened to their daughter.

"We both love you," Lily said.

"Someone is coming to guide you to the location, so wait there," Kate said.then hung up.

They waited for about 30 minutes before spotting a woman walking towards them. Lily recognized her immediately.

"She's the teacher who took Viola," Lily told Alexander.

"I know her," Alexander said.

Lily clenched her fists, wanting to hit her for daring to hand over her child to Kate.


"You'll have all the time in the world to deal with her later," Alexander assured Lily.

Harlord smiled when she reached them. "The power couple," she smirked. "How could you kidnap a child? You're a teacher." "The teaching job was just a way to get close to Viola so I could kidnap her when the time was right. You both were so protective of her that I had no choice but to teach at her school." Harlord said without a hint of remorse.

Alexander's face remained emotionless. If only they knew what he had planned for them by the end of the day.

Tears rolled down Lily's cheeks at her words.

"Just take us there," Alexander said calmly.

Harlord looked at him and smiled. "The mighty Alexander has suddenly become so calm. Who would have thought?" She smirked, as if she'd won a lottery by kidnapping the child of the most feared man in the city."It's true what they say-even the mighty fall," she added.

Alexander remained calm.

Lily wanted to say something, but Alexander stopped her.


"Let her be."

Harlord smiled, then turned around. "Follow me."

They followed her deeper into the forest until they reached a cave.

Harlord entered, and they followed her inside, using their lights in the darkness.

Harlord stopped suddenly, causing them to stop as well.

Lily wondered what was beneath this cave.

They watched as Harlord placed her hand on the wall to their right,which shifted,revealing an iron door with a smart lock.She typed in the password, which they couldn't see, and the door opened.

Lily concluded that whoever was helping and funding Kate must be very powerful.

Harlord stepped inside, and they followed. The door shut behind them.plunging the area into darkness.

"Lights on," Harlord said, and the lights flicked on, revealing a long passageway with many doors.

Alexander wondered what was behind all these doors, knowing his daughter was likely behind one of them.

Harlord began walking, and they followed her, passing many doors until they reached the last one in the middle of the passageway. It was large and tall.

Harlord knocked, and the door was unlocked and pushed open by someone inside.

They stepped into a large room. The floor was bare ground, covered in sand and stones.

They entered and saw men dressed in black standing at each corner,holding guns.

"Stand in the middle of the room," Harlord instructed, and they complied.Alexander held Lily's hand, and they stood at the center of the room,which resembled a large underground warehouse. Alexander scanned the entire area. A small door at the end opened, and their eyes snapped towards it. Kate walked out, smiling at them. "My guests have arrived," she said.taking a seat in a chair facing them, holding a shotgun in her hand.

Alexander and Lily hadn't brought their guns, knowing they'd be confiscated.

It had been over three years since Lily last saw Kate. She couldn't deny how much Kate had changed. Her grandfather had shaved off Bella and Kate's hair, and with the scars on their heads, it was impossible for their hair to grow fully. So, Kate's shoulder-length blondde hair was a wig.

"Hand over my child," Alexander said coldly.

Kate's eyes flicked towards him, her heart softening at his handsomeness.
He was as striking as ever. "I'll decide when you see her," she replied.

"If you give her to us and let us leave, I promise to let you live."

Kate laughed. "Let me live?" She frowned. "You're on my turf,so you should be begging me to let you live."

Alexander smiled.

Kate was startled by his smile. Alexander didn't smile often, so seeing it now meant he had a plan to get them out of there. But as she considered how secure the place was, she dismissed it asan empty threat.

"Who else is involved? You mentioned a surprise for me?" Lily asked.

 Kate smiled and nodded. "I did. He'lI be here soon," she smirked, eager to see Lily's reaction when she met the person who wanted her husband's downfall. They heard the large door behind them open. "Oh, he's here already," Kate said excitedly.

Lily and Alexander turned simuItaneously to see who it was.

Lily's eyes widened in shock when she saw who it was.

"Albert?"

Her ex-boyfriend Albert? She couldn't believe it.
###Chapter 90

For the past three years, she had no information about Albert and assumed he had returned to his home country. But now, here he stood,the very person funding Kate and her accomplice in their schemes.

“Albert,how...?”

"How am I here?" Albert interrupted.

Alexander had furrowed his brows the moment Albert entered the scene.Seeing Albert as the one plotting his downfall was not entirely unexpected.

"How could you, Albert? I can't recall doing anything wrong to you,nor has Alexander, to warrant this."

Albert erupted in laughter, loud and unrestrained, before abruptly stopping and fixing a stern look on Alexander.

“Didn't he tell you what he did?”

Lily's eyes darted between them. “What's he talking about, Alexander?”

Alexander tightened his grip on Lily. “Ignore him."

"Ignore me?!” Albert fumed. “Youa don't want her  to know how you nearly destroyed my life?!” He turned to Lily. "Did he not tell you how he ruined my business? After I approached him for a partnership that day you were there,my company started collapsing-all because of him!" Albert's voice shook with anger as he pointed accusingly at Alexander. Alexander stood unmoved by his words. Lily looked at Alexander, waiting for him to deny Albert's claims, but he remained silent.

Kate sat nearby, enjoying the unfolding drama.

"Your dear husband felt threatened by my sudden presence in Aurora City because I'm your ex. His jealousy consumed him, leading him to destroy my company, bleed it dry until it went under, and then ensure I left the country with nothing!”

Lily was shocked by what Albert had just revealed. She looked at Alexander, whose expression confirmed that what Albert said was true.Was it really jealousy that drove him to such lengths? She hadn't thought Alexander capable of that, especially since Albert had not made any inappropriate advances toward her-unless there was another reason.

“Alexander,is what he's saying true?"

“We'll discuss that later," he responded, turning his attention back to Albert. "Where is my daughter? Hand her over."

Albert frowned. "I advise you not to use that tone; you're on my turf."

Alexander smiled at the remark. “Seems like you want to be ruined again."

His words ignited a fiery rage in Albert.He clenched his fists so tightly that his nails dug into his skin. “When I'm done with you, you won't even have a tongue left to speak!" he threatened.Albert then turned to Kate. "Bring her out." Kate stood up, nodding. “It's about time," she said, clearly excited. This was the moment she had been waiting for-the moment to see fear and despair in Lily. 
Kate signaled to the men, and soon, little Viola was brought into the room.

Lily and Alexander smiled upon seeing their daughter.

“Mummy! Daddy!" Viola cried out, struggling to break free from the person holding her, but she couldn't, and soon, tears began to flow.

“Viola, don't cry. We'll be out of here soon, okay? Daddy and I will take you out of here soon," Lily reassured her.

Hearing her mother's voice, Viola stopped crying and wiped away her tears,trusting that her parents would take her home soon.

Alexander felt a sense of relief seeing his daughter, even though he wasn't holding her yet. It was only a matter of time before all of this was over.

“Aww, what a touching mother-daughter moment," Kate mocked before turning serious. “Move her to the center," she ordered, and the person holding Viola placed her in the middle of the room,not far from where Lily and Alexander were standing.

Viola was set down on the floor, and the person who had been holding her moved away.

Seeing this, Lily instinctively wanted to rush to her daughter and pick her up, but the sudden sound of a gunshot froze her in place. She looked towards Viola, fearing the worst, but felt a wave of relief when she saw that Viola was unharmed, though she was crying. Who was shot? Lily wondered, her heart racing. She quickly turned around,and her world shattered. “Alexander!” Lily screamed when she saw that Alexander had been shot in his right leg. He made no sound, enduring the pain in silence, his attention focused on Lily and Viola, who were both crying. Seeing them like this hurt him more than the wound.


Lily was about to rush to his side, but the sound of a second gunshot stopped her in her tracks. Her heart pounded in fear.

Who was shot this time? She was looking at Alexander, so it wasn't him.Slowly, she turned, dread filling her, and saw a gun pointed at Viola's head,her mouth now covered with tape.


“She was crying too much, so I had to quiet her," Kate said,her voice dripping with malice. "If I were you, I wouldn't move from that spot. If you do,one of them will die."

Lily looked between Alexander and Viola, seeing Viola trembling in fear while Alexander appeared calm, though she knew he was in pain from the shot. If they didn't treat him soon, the wound could become infected.

“Alexander...”

"I'm fine," he assured her.

"It'll get infected," Lily said,tears streaming down her face.

“Relax, trust me,” he urged her.

Understanding his meaning,she tried to calm herself. “Viola, don't be afraid, okay? Remember what Daddy taught you,"Alexander said to his daughter. Viola nodded. Despite being so young, she understood the situation she was in. Her father had always prepared her for dangerous situations and taught her not to be paralyzed by fear.

“Aww, what a beautiful family," Albert finally spokeafter watching in silence.“I love how you all support each other, but how long can that last?”


"Kate, let's move on to the next stage." Albert said.

“Your wish is my command," Kate replied with a mocking laugh.

“You both have lost your minds,"'Lily said.

“I've certainly lost mine,” Kate agreed with a grin.

"But I haven't," Albert said. “Anyone in my position would seek justice."

"You call this justice?!” Lily shouted.

“Yes.”

“Alexander never shot you in the foot!"

"I enjoy seeing him suffer! After this, he'll face more torture, and then I'll make sure he signs all his wealth over to me. He'll be left with nothing!"Albert declared, his face twisted with rage.

“You still have a chance to stop, Albert, and I'll forgive you."
 
Albert laughed. “There's no turning back now." “Kate, you can end this. I promise I won't take your life; I'll just send you back to prison. But if you continue, and by any chance I survive this,I'll make sure you're dead," Lily threatened, her tone deadly serious.Albert expected Kate to laugh as usual, but instead, he saw fear in her eyes. Was Kate now afraid of Lily? He remembered Kate as the ruthless and wicked stepsister.


Kate remained silent, recognizing the seriousness in Lily's eyes. But how could Lily kill her when she was the one destined to die first?

Kate's fear was quickly replaced by confidence as she recalled the traps she had set for Lily. Lily wouldn't survive.

“Open the floor!" Kate shouted.

A subordinate pressed a button on the wall, and the ground beneath Lily began to shift.

"What the hell...”

“Lily!!" Alexander wanted to rush to her aid but was stopped.

“Take one more step, and I'll blow her head off," Kate threatened,pointing a gun at Lily.

Alexander couldn't move. He watched in horror as the ground around Lily opened up, leaving her stranded on a narrow ledge. She looked down and saw a deep, dark pit below, sending a shiver down her spine. One wrong move, and she would fall in.

Alexander felt terrified for her. What was her stepsister planning? "My love,look at me, don't look down.”


Lily heard his voice and turned her gaze towards him. "Stay calm and don't move, okay?” She nodded, then glanced at Viola, who was still crying. "What now?" she asked Kate.

"I like how you're always ready for the next challenge." Kate said with a smile."Now we move on to the fun part."

She turned to her subordinates."Turn it on." she ordered, and another button was pressed.

The ground beneath Lily began to heat up, and before she could fully grasp what was happening.flames erupted from below.

Fire encircled her, trapping her in place with no escape.

Lily was stunned, completely unprepared for this. She looked around.but the fire blocked her view of Alexander and Viola. The heat was unbearable.like she was in hell.

"Lily! Lily!" She heard Alexander calling her name.

Was this how she would die? The thought crossed her mind as she closed her eyes, clenched her fists, and tried to endure the intense heat.

###Chapter 91

Lilly's situation was critical. Flames surrounded her, casting sinister shadows on her frightened face. The thick smoke engulfed her, making it difficult to breathe as her lungs struggled with the toxic fumes.Her clothes were scorched and torn, her skin reddened and blistered from the searing heat.


Amidst the chaos, the menacing laughter of her stepsister echoed through the blaze, a haunting reminder of the betrayal that had led to this horrifying moment.

Outside the inferno, Alexander's desperate cries pierced the night, his voice filled with anguish and terror. Their child, Viola, called out for her mother,her innocent voice trembling with fear.

Lilly's body felt as though it was being consumed by the flames, each passing second more excruciating than the last. She knew her chances of survival were slipping away, and a sense of helplessness overwhelmed her as she braced for the worst.

Was this the end for her? She had steeled herself for death, but not like this-not without saying goodbye to the people she loved,to Alexander.the love of her life, and to their child, Viola. Sweat poured down Lilly's face from the intense heat,her breath growing shallow as her vision blurred. Hot tears streamed down her cheeks as thoughts of the two people she cherished most flooded her mind.What would become of them once she was gone? Suddenly, she heard faint, terrifying screams. She could no longer hear Alexander's voice calling her name, nor Viola's cries, and the silence terrified her. Had something terrible happened to them? The memory of Alexander's leg wound filled her with dread.

"Alexander! Viola!" she tried to shout, but her voice cracked, and she coughed from the thick smoke. The screams continued,growing fainter.until they felt distant, almost as if they were coming from within her mind.She heard multiple voices, screams mingled with Alexander's pleading for her to stay with him.

The last thing she saw before losing consciousness was the blurred image of Alexander's worried face, tears rolling down her cheeks as she passed out.

Alexander quickly lifted her and carried her out of the blaze, rushing her to the medical van brought by the rescue team. He placed her gently on the bed inside the van.

"Sir!" the medic exclaimed.

"She's unconscious and struggling to breathe. Make sure she's okay,without any complications. Do you understand me?" Alexander's voice was sharp with urgency, causing the doctor to shrink back in fear.

"Y-yes, sir. I will make sure she's fine," the doctor stammered.

Alexander fixed the doctor with a warning glare. "Do everything you can,or you'll be among those who won't survive the night." Alexander meant every word. He would ensure that those who hurt Lilly and their child would pay, and their bodies would be sent back to their families.The doctor trembled, his dark gaze leaving him shaking uncontrollably. "I...will...make sure," the doctor stammered again. Alexander took one last look at Lilly, his heart aching at the sight of her like this. The thought of her trapped in that fire made him clench his fists.His world had nearly collapsed when the flames surrounded her,and he had been ready to dive into the fire to save her. But at that moment,his friend arrived with his men, and they managed to extinguish the flames.

All of Albert and Kate's men were killed, and Alexander made sure Albert.Kate, and the teacher who dared to take Viola were taken to his underground base, where they awaited their fate.

"I promise they'll all pay. Just get well soon, for us," he whispered to the unconscious Lilly, kissing her forehead before leaving the medical van.

"Sir, you're bleeding, and it looks like the wound is infected," the doctor noted, unable to ignore the bullet wound.
し
Alexander looked down at his injured leg, almost forgetting he had been shot. His mind had been entirely consumed with thoughts of Lilly and their child.


"Focus on her, not me."

"But sir, it could worsen to the point where you might lose the use of your leg," the doctor reminded him. "I'll have one of my subordinates treat it while I tend to your wife," the doctor offered.


Alexander nodded, allowing them to treat his leg. They took him to another van to care for his wound. Michael and the others arrived at the forest, where the underground base was hidden. The area was swarming with vehicles and men dressed in black. They spotted a man exuding authority, much like Alexander,giving orders to some of the men, who addressed him as "Sir" and bowed in respect.

Richard and Ethan exchanged glances, wondering who this man was.
They hadn't seen him before,so who could he be?

They only became aware of Alexander's plan a few hours ago when Max called to inform them that Viola had been rescued, prompting them to rush to this location. But the sight of the army here puzzled them-was this man someone Alexander had contacted?

"Aren't you curious?" Ethan asked.

"I am," Richard replied.

"Then let's find out who this friend of his is," Ethan suggested, starting towards the man, with Richard following closely behind.

Sarah's first priority upon arriving was to find Lilly and Viola.She spotted Viola first, sleeping in the arms of a young woman she didn't recognize.

"Viola," Sarah said, approaching the woman holding her.

The woman with red hair looked at Sarah with curiosity, and Sarah returned the look.


"Who are you?"

"Who are you?"

They spoke in unison. "You go first," the red-haired woman said. "I'm Sarah, Lilly's close friend, and you're holding her daughter, Viola,"Sarah explained, pointing to the sleeping child. The red-haired woman nodded. "I've heard of you. I'm Juliana, Antony's right-hand woman. Since Alexander and Lilly are both injured, I was asked to look after Viola."


"Alexander and Lilly are hurt?" Sarah asked, her voice laced with shock and concern. "Where is Lilly?"

"She's in the medical van over there," Juliana replied, pointing to the van.

Sarah nodded and was about to leave, but stopped and looked at Juliana. "Did you say you're Antony's right-hand woman?" Her heart pounded as she asked, hoping it wasn't who she thought. It had been five years.


"Yes."


"Where is he? Show me," her heart raced.

"Over there, talking to those two men," Juliana pointed towards Antony.

Sarah slowly turned to look in the direction. Her heart skipped a beat when she recognized him-Antony, the man she knew from five years ago in country C. It was him, in the flesh. The same man she hadn't been able to forget, even after all these years. The same handsome and dangerous figure.

He stood a short distance away,conversing with Richard and Ethan. That cold look on his face hadn't changed; he still never smiled. Sarah stood there, staring at him. He must have felt her gaze because he immediately turned to look at her, their eyes meeting. She quickly averted her gaze from his sharp eyes, turning around and hurrying towards the medical van. Her whole body trembled from his gaze, her heart pounding uncontrollably.She couldn't stay in the same space as him; she wouldn't be able to bear it. She had thought she'd forgotten about him completely, but she hadn't.

Wiping away the tears that escaped, Sarah approached the medical van.

"You can't go in," the two guards standing outside the van told her.

"I'm Sarah, Lilly's friend. I need to see her."

"Let her in," Alexander's voice commanded.

The guards stepped aside, and she entered the spacious medical van.

"Alexander, what happened to you, and what happened in there?" Sarah asked, walking over to him and looking at his bandaged foot.

"A discussion for later."

Sarah nodded. "Where's Lilly?" She looked around but didn't see her.

"The next van."

"Okay, I'll go check on her," Sarah said, turning to leave,but Alexander called her back.


"Sarah."


′′Yes?′′ "Stay with her until she wakes up, and even after she does, don't let her out of your sight. If she does, you won't like what I'll do to you,"Alexander warned. Sarah swallowed nervously, not because of what Alexander might do, but because of the other person. She planned to leave after making sure Lilly was okay; she didn't want to be anywhere near Antony-he wouldn't leave her alone. Now that Alexander had asked her to stay with Lilly,it meant she'd have to face Antony.

"Did you hear me?" Alexander asked coldly when she didn't respond.

Sarah nodded. "I did. I won't leave her side and will make sure she doesn'
t leave mine."

"Good,you can go."

Sarah left the van and headed towards the next one when a hand suddenly grabbed her, dragging her back. She winced in pain from the forceful pull. After regaining her balance, she looked up to see who had grabbed her, and right in front of her stood Antony.

He stared at her with a dark expression.

Sarah swallowed hard and took a step back,but he moved closer.

She tried to retreat again.

"If you take another step back, I'll cut off your legs and see if you can run from me again," he threatened, his voice filled with anger.

Sarah dared not move again. If he said he would cut off her legs,he meant it.
###Chapter 92

Five years ago, when she left him. Antony had become obsessed with finding her. Despite his expertise in tracking down people no matter how well they hide, he couldn't locate the woman he loved deeply. Sarah had concealed herself perfectly, fully aware of his abilities after being with him for two years. She knew exactly how to stay hidden from him.

Now, here she was, standing before him, more stunning than ever. There was no chance he would let her slip away again. Coming to Country A turned out to be the best decision he had made, and he owed Alexander for it since it led him to his lost love.

After a prolonged silence where they simply gazed at each other, Antony finally spoke.

"I'm relieved to find you here, Sarah," he said softly.

"Antony,what do you want?" she asked.

"What do I want? Is that what you say to someone you haven't seen in five years, someone you ran away from?" The pain of her leaving still stung every time he recalled it.

Sarah bit her lip. "It's been five years, let's just move on..."

"Quiet!" Antony interrupted, his voice raised.
"In the last five years, were you able to move on? So why should I?"Antony asked. "I have moved on. I have a good jobas a detective in G City."Michael wanted to step in to protect Sarah from Antony but was stopped by Jacob. "I don't care; you need to come home with me,Sarah.""Why are you holding me back?"

"What exactly do you think you're going to do?"

"Can't you see how he's yelling at her?" Michael said.

"Can't you see that they clearly know each other?" Jacob replied.

Michael looked at the two, "Okay, they seem familiar with each other, but how does she know someone like him?"

"We'll find out, but for now, let's just observe."

"What if he does something to her? Aren't you worried about that?"

"He won't. Look beyond the anger; there's concern in his eyes, like he's hurt."

Michael studied Antony closely, but all he saw was anger. "I don't see it,just anger."

"Well, I do. He cares about her. They must have a history. Antony is similar to Alexander; hard to read, but deeply caring."

"So now you're a psychologist?"

"No,just good at seeing what others miss."

Michael nodded. "Alright then, let's stay close in case anything happens." "Home? What home? Did we ever have one?"

Antony's face grew cold. "Yes, we did, and it's time for you to return!"

"Your home, with all your family members-do you call that our home?"Sarah's eyes welled up as she thought about the past. She had lived on Antony's family estate, where,despite his own mansion, she constantly faced his family and their meddling in their relationship.

Antony moved closer, wiping away her tears. "Please, don't cry. I'm sorry."

"You're sorry?"

"Yes. I'm sorry I didn'tsee what was happening then." Sarah stepped back from him. "I need to take care of Lilly, so leave me alone," she said.turning and walking away.

Antony watched her go, determined never to lose her again.

Sarah entered Lilly's medical van, making sure her tears were gone before she did. She approached Lilly, who lay unconscious on the bed,tended by a nurse.


"Ma'am, you're not supposed to be here," the nurse said.

"I was told to look after her."

"Okay, if you say so. I'll leave now," the nurse said before exiting the vanSarah sat besíde Lilly, gazing at her pale face. "I don't know what you went through, but please wake up soon. There's something I need to tell you," she murmured. Meanwhile, Antony entered another van where Alexander was. "How's your injury?"

"It's fine."

"Good," Antony said as he sat across from him. "I need to thank you."

Alexander looked up. "For what?"

"For being here."

Alexander furrowed his brow. "I shouald be thanking you. If it weren't for your help. I'd have been burned alive trying to save Lilly from that fire. So.I should be thanking you, Antony," he said sincerely. He wasn't one to express gratitude, believing people should do their jobs, but this was different-this was about saving his family.

Antony was surprised by the heartfelt thanks but understood why. He had been shocked when he learned that Alexander had married and had a child. He never imagined that the cold-hearted man would settle down.

"But I'm glad you asked for my help. Coming here was the best decision I've made in years. If I hadn't come, I wouldn't have found her," Antony said.


"Found her?" Alexander knew who he meant-the woman Antony had been searching for the past five years. The one he loved and had wanted to marry before she left. If Alexander remembered correctly, her disappearance was the only thing that had ever broken Antony's heart. Alexander hadn't understood his pain then, but he did now, having experienced the same fear when Lilly disappeared in the mountains. "Is she here?" Alexander asked. "Yes," Antony nodded.

"Someone I know?"

"Yes, very close to your family, very close to Lilly."

Alexander thought for a moment and one name came to mind."You mean Sarah?"


"Yes."

"You mean Sarah is the woman who left you five years ago?"

"It's shocking, right? But yes, it's her."

"She's good at hiding," Alexander said. There was no one in the world Antony couldn't find-except Sarah.

"Yes, she is. She learned from the best," Antony smiled.

Alexander shook his head. "So, what are you going to do now?"

"What do you think? I'm taking her back to G City."

"Sarah is doing well here. She's a detective in G City. Would she want to leave,especially after what your family did to her?" Alexander asked.

He knew what had driven the woman away but never expected it to be Sarah. Antony clenched his fists. "I only found out what they did after she left. If I'd known sooner, I would have made sure she stayed. By now, we'd be married with children." His fists tightened. "I'm taking Sarah back. She'll wear the engagement ring I bought five years ago, and we'll marry as soon as possible."

"What if she doesn't want to?" Alexander might not have cared about Antony's plans, but Sarah was Lilly's friend.

Antony frowned, giving Alexander a stern look before leaning in. "Don't interfere in my business. Focus on your own family and getting justice for them. I'll take care of Sarah. Whether she likes it or not, she's coming back with me to G City tomorrow mnorning."

Alexander gave him an unreadable look before nodding. "Okay."

Antony stood up. "Thanks again. If it weren't for coming here, I wouldn't have found her. Tell Lilly I promise to take care of her friend and give her everything she deserves," he said before leaving the van.

Alexander only nodded and smiled. He wouldn't interfere because if he were in Antony's shoes, he'd do the same, crushing anyone who stood in the way of being with the one he loved.
###Chapter 93

Lilly stood frozen in terror as the blade advanced towards Alexander, the cold metal drawing nearer with each heartbeat. Her voice failed her,and her body refused to move as she desperately wished to intervene, but her limbs were paralyzed. She longed to throw herself in front of Alexander to shield him from Albert, but she was helpless.

The atmosphere was thick with fear and despair. The walls seemedto close in around her, trapping her in a nightmare. She couald only watch as Albert drove the blade into Alexander's heart, and right before her eyes,he collapsed to the floor,lifeless.

“Alexanderrrrr!!!" she screamed, bolting upright in bed, gasping for air.

“Lilly," Sarah, who was sitting nearby, rushed over to her.

"It's alright.," Sarah soothed, patting her back. “It was just a nightmare."

Lilly scanned the large hospital room and realized she had been dreaming.
"Where are Alexander and Viola?”

“Viola is sleeping in the room over there, and Alexander is at the base where Kate and the others were kept."

The hospital room had an adjacent space where visitors could sleep while watching over their loved ones. They had left the forest in the middle of the night and brought Lilly to the hospital. Although Alexander was told that Lilly didn't need hospitalization since she was already fine and just needed to wake up,he insisted on staying with her until she was fully recovered. He didn't want Viola to be separated from her mother, so he arranged for her to stay in the guest room within Lilly's hospital room.

Lilly tried to get up, but Sarah stopped her. "Relax, you just woke up."

"I need to see Viola and the others. We finally got Viola back."

Sarah could see the determination in Lilly's eyes for revenge.

“I know, but Alexander will be furious if I let you out of bed,"Sarah warned.

"Alright, but I need to see Viola." Lilly began to rise on her own but felt dizzy.

"Careful," Sarah said, helping her. “I'll take you to see her."

Lilly nodded.

They both went to the other room to see Viola.

Lilly sighed with relief when she saw her daughter sleeping peacefully,tears welling in her eyes. A wave of relief washed over her as she gazed at her now-safe daughter. Emotions surged as memories of the past flooded back, vividly recalling the heartbreaking moment when Kate had taken her daughter away.

But now, with her daughter safely by her side and Alexander unharmed.a fierce resolve grew within her. Lilly was determined to bring an end to Kate and Albert, and anyone else involved in the past events. The fire of justice burned brightly within her,and she was committed to ensuring no harm would come to her loved ones again. "I'm glad she's safe now and that you and Alexander are alright too. It's all over now." Barah sald.

Lilly kissed Viola's forehead before standing up from the bed on her own."It's not over unil they're all six feet under."she replied to Sarah,who nodded in agreement.

"But first, you need to get back to bed. P'll ask the doctor tocheck on you and let Alexander know that you're awake"

Lilly nodded,though she wanted to head straight to the base anid exact her revenge, knowing that Alexander wouldn't allow it until he was sure she had fully recovered.

In one of the base's torture rooms, the screams of Alexander's tormentors echoed loudly.

Alexander stood before Albert, whose entire bodly was already stained with blood. Alexander had already inflicted significant pain but was not satisfied until he finished him. Kate, on the other hand, had been severely tortured. He would wait until Lilly was out of the hospital to decide what to do with her sister, while he focused on dealing with Albert.

Alexander picked up the heated knife from the fire and brought it close to Albert, who stared at it in horror.

"I gave you the chance to let us go, but you refused. I warned you, didn't 1? There will be no mercy," Alexander said darkly, his expression causing Albert to tremble.Alexander placed the hot knife on Albert's chest, and he screamed in terror. Alexander left the knife on his chest, and Albert continued to scream in agony. Ethan entered the torture room and sighed at the scene of Alexander torturing Albert.

"He's too loud, Alexander. Just take the knife out of his chest so it's a bit quieter."

"Why are you here? I don't recall calling you," Alexander spoke harshly.

"I know, but I came to inform you that Sarah called from the hospital."

Alexander turned to him. "What did she say? Are Lilly and Viola alright?"he asked,worried.


“Relax, they're fine. She called to tell you that Lilly is awake and even wanted to come here, but Sarah had to stop her." Alexander sighed in relief. With everything that had happened in recent days, he couldn't help but worry about every little thing concerning Lilly and Viola.

"She also mentioned that her grandfather and father, along with your grandmother and a few others, are visiting her."


Alexander nodded. “Remove the knife from his chest and lock himin one of the cells. I'm going to the hospital." He left the torture room.

“But...why me?" Ethan muttered, staring at the knife in Albert's chest.

He felt nauseous just looking at the wounds on Albert's body. How was he supposed to do this?

On his way out of the base, Alexander met Antony outside. “Are you heading to the hospital?"

"Yes, I am. Lilly woke up." I'm coming with you." Antonysaid.

Alexander gave him a look. "I thought you were leaving today?"

“Not without Sarah.”

"So,you're coming to the hospital because of her?"

"Yes, and also tosay goodbye to your wife and child."

Alexander nodded and headed to his car, while Antony joined him, and they drove to the hospital.

"I'm so glad you're okay, my child,” Grandma Helen said, touching Lilly's forehead."I was so scared something would happen to Viola,you,and Alexander. I stayed up all night praying in the family temple for you to find Viola safe and sound, but then I heard what happened to you, and I was so distressed I had to remain in the temple and pray that you would be alright."

Lilly held her grandmother's hand and smiled warmly at her. “Thank you,Grandma, for staying in the temple and praying for us. I'm sorry for making you so worried-and letting all of this affect your health.”

"Silly child, my health is just fine."

Lilly knew the old woman was lying, but instead of arguing, she just smiled.“Okay,Grandma.”After Grandma left, she also spoke to her father, then Michael and Jacob came for a short while,followed by the others.Lilly glanced at her watch and frowned. She hated being stuck here instead of at the base. She looked towards the door when it opened and was disappointed to see Sarah entering.

"Not happy to see me? You must be bored of me already," Sarah pouted.

“Did you tell Alexander I woke up?"

“Yes, he's on his way here." Sarah said, looking at Viola, who was sleeping close to her mother in the spacious hospital bed. Since they got her back from Kate, all she had done was sleep, wake up to eat, and then sleep again. She hadn't said much since. The cheerful and lively Viola hadn't returned yet. Witnessing her father being shot and seeing a fire surrounding her mother, coupled with the horrific people who kidnapped her, must have shocked her to the core. Such an experience can deeply affect a child mentally.

Two psychologists had visited her, and both said the same thing: that she was a child going through a profound shock, which was why she wasn't talking much yet. But with time, she would return to her cheerful self.

“Did she eat all her food?”

Lilly nodded, then looked at Viola sitting close to her. She ran a hand through her hair and kissed her cheek.

The hospital door suddenly opened, and both Lilly and Sarah turned to see Alexander and Antony walk in. Alexander wasted no time approaching Lilly and hugging her tightly, as if his very soul depended on it. Lilly hugged him back, "Alexander..." "I'm sorry for not being here when you woke up, my love. I'm so relieved that youa and Viola are okay."

They kissed passionately, as if they hadn't seen each other for a long time.

Sarah glanced at Antony, who had been staring at her since he walked into the room.


“Don't you think we're interrupting them?" Antony said,looking at Alexander and Lilly, who were being so affectionate without caring if anyone else was present.


Sarah knew she should leave the loving couple alone, but she also knew that stepping outside the room would mean she'd have to talk to Antony.She looked at them and sighed before walking out of the VIP hospital room, with Antony following, a smirk on his face.

She walked a bit farther from the room and then sat on one of the benches in the corridor.

Antony sat on the same bench. "We're leaving first thing tomorrow morning.”

"I'm not going back there with you."

Antony raised her chin so she would look him in the eye.

“You're coming with me whether you like it or not, Sarah."

“You're going to take me with you against my will?”

Antony softened, running a hand through her hair, "Sarah, I love you so much, and I can't be with any other woman but you. I'm sorry I didn't know what was happening or how my family treated you. You could have told me, but you know I was hardly around.”
Sarah moved his hand away from her chin. "I'm not coming with you."

Antony clenched his fist. As much as he wanted to take her with him against her will, he knew that would only make her resent him more.
After calming his nerves to keep his patience, he then said,"Tell me what you want me to do to make things right, and I will-please."

Sarah looked him in the eye and saw his longing for her. Her heart still beat for him even after five years. Should she just go back with him and face everyone? She was the one who left, but here he was, begging her to come back.


"I'm not ready to go back yet," she said softly.

"Yet? Does that mean you'll give us a chance?" Antony asked, hope flickering in his eyes.

“It's been five years," she replied, uncertainty in her voice.

“It doesn't matter. I want you back, even if it's been twenty years,"Antony said earnestly, placing his hand on her cheek and giving her a gentle peck.
###Chapter 94

A day later, Peter arrived at one of the most secure prisons in Aurora City where Bella was held. Each step felt like a burden as he approached the formidable gates. After undergoing multiple security checks, he was finally allowed inside to visit Bella.

It had been three long years since Bella, his former wife, was incarcerated for the heinous crime of murdering his first wife and Lilly's sisters, as well as plotting against Lilly herself. Peter had sworn never to visit her,burdened by his grief and anger.

But recentevents had shaken him deeply. Kate had crossed a line that could not be ignored-she had kidnapped Viola, his granddaughter,thrusting both families into a nightmare of fear and despair. Peter had made the difficult decision to visit Bella after Lilly recounted everything that had happened in Kate's underground lair. Learning about what Lilly endured enraged him. If Alexander's friend hadn't arrived in time with his team, Lilly might have perished in that fire.

As Peter walked through the cold, sterile corridors of the prison, memories of the years he spent with Bella flooded his mind. Who could have imagined things would turn out this way?


Finally,he reached the visiting area, where Bella sat behind a thick glass barrier, dressed in an orange jumpsuit. She looked older than the last time he had seen her. When Bella raised her head and saw Peter, her eyes widened in shock.She wasn't expecting him, nor was she anticipating anyone to visit her. She had heard that Alexander had ordered no one to visit her, so when she was informed of a visitor, she was genuinely surprised and curious to see who it was. Their eyes met, and Peter stared at her for a moment before taking his seat.

He picked up the phone, taking a deep breath before speaking, his voice filled with a mix of anger and disappointment. "I vowed never to come here and see your face again, not after everything you did to my family.I was good to you, Bella. I cheated on my wife with you,letting down my entire family. From the moment I allowed you into the Blake residence,my once happy family was ruined. I was a fool and the worst father to my children. You murdered my wife, my two daughters, and even attempted to kill Lilly."

He clenched his fist as he spoke. "You poisoned Kate's mind, turning her against her own sister. In case you're unaware, Kae escaped from prison with outside help. And do you know what she did?"

Bella,who had been looking down, snapped her head up, eyes wide with shock upon hearing that Kate had escaped. Did it make her happy that her daughter had managed to flee? Yes, it did. She was resigned to dying in prison herself, but the thought of Kate spending her life there troubled her deeply. She felt a twisted pride that her daughter had escaped and hoped she would go far and live her life freely.

"Kate kidnapped Lilly's child and tried to kill Lilly again,as well as harm Alexander, all in the name of revenge."

Bella was stunned. She hadn't expected Kate to do that; she had hoped Kate wouId be smart enough to flee as far as possible. Kate should have known that going against Alexander would only lead to her death.

"Thankfully, she didn't succeed. Right now, Kate and her accomplices are locked up in one of Alexander's bases. This time, he plans to end her life for good. If she tries to escape, she will meet the same fate." Bella's eyes widened in shock. "No," she muttered,shaking her head and attempting to stand, but the female prison guard held her down.

Bella, who hadn't spoken untl now, quickly picked up the phone to speak to Peter. "Peter, please, I'm begging you-don't let them do it. I'm sorry for everything I've done. Please don't let Kate be killed."

Peter sighed. "There's nothing I can do, Lilly and Alexander have already made up their minds," he said solemnly.

"She's your daughter!" Bella cried out through the phone, foreing Peter to pull it away from his ear slightly.

Tears began to stream down her face, and Peter watched as she wept.

"Yes, she is my daughter. Do you think what Kate has done doesn't affect me? Of course it does. It breaks my heart to see her living this way. But do you really think there's anything I can do?"

"Yes, you can plead on her behalf! Are you really going to stand by and watch Lilly kill her own sister?" Bella implored.

Peter was taken aback. He couldn't bear the thought-they were sisters,after all, despite everything. But Kate was unrepentant, and if she were allowed to live, she would undoubtedly come back to harm Lilly and her family. "Please, Peter, do something. You're a father-how can you just stand by and watch her die?" Bella sobbed. Peter dropped the phone and stood up. He was filled with regret and remorse for everything that had happened in his family. If things were the way they were now, it was all his fault. If he hadn't cheated on his first wife with Bella, none of this would have happened. His two daughterswould stll be alive, and his first wife would stillbe with him.

Peter was about to leave but felt there was one last thing he needed to say.He picked up the phone again.

"T'm sorry, Bella. I'm sorry for ever meeting you all those years ago. If we had never met, things wouldn't have turned out this way, My family would still be whole, and you would have found someone else and had your own happy family. I will carry this regret with me untiI the day f die.
11

Bella listened to his words, tears streaming down her face.

As Peter walked away from the prison, he wondered if his words had made any difference. Bella might be locked up, but the wounds she had inflicted on their lives were still painfully fresh.

After leaving the prison, he headed straight to Alexander's base, where Lilly was. Even though Lilly wanted to end Kate's life, Peter was determined not to let her kill her own sister with her own hands.

At the base, Lilly stood a short distance from Kate,holding a shotgun aimed at Kate's head.
###Chapter 95

Alexander held the top of the gun that Lily was gripping. "Let go," she demanded, but he shook his head.
"Please, let me handle this. The last thing I want is for your hands to be tainted with this," Alexander urged.
"No,Alexander. I need to do this myself. She's my blood, and if anyone should be responsible, it should be..."
"It shouldn't be you," Peter said from behind, causing both Alexander and Lily to turn around.

Peter walked towards them until he was standing in front of them.

"Dad, what are you doing here?" Lily asked, surprised to see her father at the base. The last thing she wanted was for him to witness her taking Kate's life, given that Kate was still his daughter,despite everything.

Peter glanced at Kate, who was barely recognizable due to the torture she had endured. He averted his gaze, deeply affected by seeing his daughter in such a state. Peter turned back to Lily and Alexander. "You should listen to Alexander.Your hands should remain clean. If anyone has to end Kate's life,it certainly shouldn't be you, Lily. She's your blood, and though she may deserve her fate, you shouldn't carry that burden. If you do this,you'll never forget it; this day will haunt you forever." "I've already made up my mind, Father," Lily said,resolute. Peter stepped closer and gently took the gun from her hand. "You don't have to do this."Alexander observed the exchange, relieved that Peter was there to dissunde her. He would take care of things himself. He didn't want Lily to bear the weight of this act.

After convincing Lily to step back. Peter appronched Kate,who was fied to a chair nearby. She was so battered that her face was aimost unrecognizable.

"Kate," he called, and she slowly ralsed her head, wincing in pain. When she realized it was her father standing before her, she scoffed."What do you want?" she asked angrily, her father being the last person she wanted to see.

"I'm sorry for not being a good father," he said,his voice heavy with regret.

Kate was taken aback by his words.

"I'm sorry for not guiding you better. If I hadn't overlooked so much in the past, perhaps things wouldn't have come to this."

Despite her pain, Kate let out a bitter laugh. "For your information,I disowned you as my father a long time ago. You're nothing to me now,so I don't care what you have to say," she sneered. "But know this-my death will haunt you forever for just standing by and watching." Her words echoed in his mind, but Peter responded with sorrow. "You're right, it will haunt me, but not for the reasons you think. It will haunt me because I am to blame for all of this. If I hadn't betrayed Lily's mother by getting involved with Bella, you wouldn't have been born into this world.My infidelity brought you into existence, and for that, I'm entirely to blame. His words shocked Kate, bringing tears to her eyes. She had never expected him to say something so painful, something that would cut so deeply, "Go to hell!" she screamed through her tears. Being reminded that she was the product of an affair struck a blow to her pride.

Lily and Alexander stood nearby, watching the scene unfold. They never expected Peter to speak so harshly, even if it was the truth.His words hit Kate hard, making her realize the full weight of whathe was saying.

"May we never meet again in another life," Peter said before turning and leaving the torture room. He didn't bother to look back at Lily.

Lily watched him go, then turned her gaze to Kate, who was still weeping.

"I think you should go home and rest. I'll handle everything from here.You'll hear of her death soon," Alexander suggested.

"I don't want to go home. I need to stay until I know for sure that she's dead," Lily replied.

Alexander sighed. "If her death is going to weigh on you, we can go through legal channels instead of doing this illegally."

"We tried the legal way before, but she escaped," Lily reminded him.

"Yes, but this time I'll make sure she's sentenced to death. Would you prefer that?" After thinking it over, Lily nodded. "That's better. What about Albert and the others?" "They'll die by my hand1. I'm only letting Kate go through the legal process because I don't want you to carry the burden of killing your own blood. Let the justice system do its job."

 Lily nodded and sighed in relief, feeling a weight lift off her shoulders.

Alexander later dealt with Albert and the others personally, ensuring their deaths. Anyone who dared to harm his loved ones would face his wrath.This would serve as a lesson to his enemies.

Three days later, after the court case, Kae was sentenced to death by hanging.

Bella received an anonymous letter in prison about her daughter's sentence. She tried to take her own life, believing that everything was her fault, but Alexander's people in the prison stopped her. Alexander had many eyes and ears within the prison walls, even among Bella's cellmates,who were keeping close watch on her.

According to them, their master, Alexander, insisted that Bella remain alive to continually reflect on her misdeeds until the day she dies. Staying alive was her punishment.

Lily was glad she had listened to her father and hadn't taken Kate's life with her own hands. If she had, the guilt of her sister's blood on her hands would have haunted her. Finally, everything was over, and they could move on with their lives.Viola returned to her cheerful self after the kidnapping. The chaos in Aurora City caused by the kidnapping eventually died down, and all articles-both old and new-about Viola Kane's abduction and the Kane and Blake family conglomerates were permanently erased from the internet. Alexander and Lily decided that Viola would be homeschooled from now on to prevent anything like this from ever happening again.
###Chapter 96

Six months later, in one of the grandest chapels in H City, Lily couldn't help but beam as she watched her beautiful friend emerge from the car.Today marked the wedding of Sarah and Antony, with Lily serving as the maid of honor.


It wasn't until Antony had moved to H City that Lily learned of the love story between Sarah and Antony. Sarah had kept their relationship a secret for four years. After hiearing their tale, Lily felt overjoyed that they had reunited and were now set to be married.

Sarah and Antony's wedding was a grand spectacle, hosted in one of the largest chapels in H City. The venue was an architectural marvel, with towering stained glass windows casting a warm, colorful light throughout the chapel. The high, vaulted ceilings adorned with intricate carvings and chandeliers added an air of elegance and grandeur.

As Sarah made her way down the aisle, she radiated beauty in her wedding gown. The dress was a stunning ivory piece, intricately detailed with lace, featuring a fitted bodice and a flowing train that seemed endess.Her veil, also adorned with delicate lace, framed her face perfectly.She carried a bouquet of white roses and lilies, adding an element of timeless grace to her ensemble.Antony,dressed in a classíc black tuxedo, looked equally striking. His crisp white shirt and black bow tie perfectly complemented Sarah's attire. He stood at the altar,exuding charm, his eyes filled with anticipation and joy. The chapel was filled with their friends and family, enveloping the atmosphere in warmth and love. The wedding had garnered widespread attention, not merely because of the couple but also due to their connections with Alexander Kane and Lily Armstrong. The event had become the talk of the town, with paparazzi and reporters eager to capture the perfect photo and story.

"I do.”

"I do."

"You may kiss the bride."

Antony wasted no time lifting her veil and locking lips with her, earning a joyful round of applause from the crowd. Viola, the flower girl,watched with a smile, dreaming of having a wedding like this one day.

Outside the chapel, the couple took photos together with their families and friends. Even Antony's relatives, who had initially disapproved of Sarah,had no choice but to attend the wedding.

Viola stood by, smiling as she watched the photo session,her curiosity piqued.

"Viola," Alexander and Lily called out as they walked toward their daughter, hand in hand.

Viola rushed to her parents and hugged their legs. Alexander picked her up and kissed her on the forehead.

“Daddy,Mommy.” “Yes,dear?” “Do all couples take pictures on their wedding day?" "Yes, sweetheart, they do. It helps them remember the day and show it to their children and grandchildren," Lily replied. Viola glanced back at the couple taking photos before turning to her parents."But you've never shown me your wedding pictures," she pouted.curious to see her mother's beautiful gown and her father's well-tailored tuxedo.


Alexander and Lily were taken aback, caught off guard by her question.They exchanged looks, momentarily at a loss for words.

They didn't know how to explain that they didn't have wedding photos since they never had a traditional white wedding or church ceremony due to the circumstances under which they married.

Alexander gently caressed his daughter's hair and smiled.“Soon,my love.Ours will be even more glamorous, and there will be plenty of pictures to look at, okay?" Viola smiled and nodded.

Lily leaned in and whispered to Alexander,“Are you saying we'll get married again?"

"Yes, Mrs. Kane, we wil have a church wedding once I sort a few things out." Alexander whispered back.

Lily smiled joyfully and kissed his cheek. “I'll be waiting,"she said.Alexander shook his head. "No, no, no, that's not a proper kiss." He leaned closer and kissed her deeply on the lips.

Viola closed her eyes, giving her parents a moment of privacy. ********************** Meanwhile, in a hidden underground medical research facility in Northern Europe,a pale-skinned girl with brunette hair lay in a king-sized bed in one of the ICU rooms. By her side sat a middle-aged woman with the same hair color,holding her hand. It had been 12 years since her daughter had fallen into a coma after a tragic accident. The woman had spent every night and day hoping and praying for her daughter's recovery.

As she prayed with her eyes closed, she suddenly felt her daughter's hand move.Startled, she opened her eyes to find her daughter wide awake.

"Oh my God!" she exclaimed, overwhelmed with shock and joy.“Oh my God,you're finally awake!" Tears streamed down her face as she looked at her daughter.


"Wh... where?” her daughter tried to speak, her voice raspy and dry.

“Let me get you some water," her mother quickly offered, rushing to fetch a glass of water. She placed a straw in it so her daughter could sip easily.

“Here, drink this slowly," she instructed.

The girl sipped the water, and once her throat felt better, she looked at her mother,eyes full of questions.“Where am I?”

Her mother, still overwhelmed with emotion, tried to calm herself before answering. “You're in a medical facility.”

The girl scanned the room before looking back at her mother.“What happened to me?" “You've been in a coma. You need to rest now. The doctors said that when you wake up, you shouldn't talk too much or move around. I need to call the doctor to check on you." "Coma," the girl repeated, the word echoing in her mind. How long had she been asleep? "Yes, my dear. Hold on, let me call the doctor."

As her mother prepared to leave the room, the girl's next words stopped her in her tracks.

"I need to get out of here. I need to find Alexander and beg for his forgiveness before it's too late, before he hates me completely," she said urgently,her voice growing hoarse again.

Her mother's expression changed. She turned slowly to face her daughter,forcing a smile. “You will, but only after you've recovered."

“No!” the girl screamed, shocking her mother.

"Jesus!" the older woman gasped, placing a hand over her heart. Even in her weakened state, her daughter's temper was still fierce.

The girl glared at her mother, her voice icy. “How long have I beenin a coma?”


Her mother hesitated, unsure whether to tell her the truth. She knew that if she didn't, her daughter would start screaming and possibly harm herself.Remembering how violent her daughter could be, she decided to answer.

"How long?" the girl demanded again, her voice sharp despite the pain in her throat. “12... years," her mother replied, trembling. The girl's eyes widened. "What did you just say?" Her tone grew eerily calm. "12 years. You've been in a coma for 12 years, and you've only just woken

 up."

"12 years," the girl muttered to herself, shaking her head in disbelief. “I've been in a coma for 12 years? No, no, no, that can't be true, Mother,"she said, tears streaming down her face. “It can't be.”

"I'm afraid it is. You nearly died in that plane crash, but fate gave you a second chance. Now, you have to live a peaceful and happy life," her mother said, trying to console her.

The girl had been only 19 years old when she was involved in the crash.She shook her head in denial, then noticed a calendar across the room.It was indeed 12 years later. How could she have been asleep for so long?

“You have to accept it," her mother insisted.

“But I need to ask for his forgiveness, Mother. I need Alexander to forgive me so we can go back to being the happy couple we were," she said, tears falling freely.

Her mother shook her head. “You can't do that anymore. Alexander Kane has moved on. He's happily married and has a child, and..."

"No! Stop! Stop!" the girl screamed, covering her ears to block out her mother's words. "No, no, no! Alexander despises women. There's no way he could end up with someone else. I'm the only woman he loves and will ever love!" she shouted,her voice breaking. Her mother rushed to her side, trying to calm her down. “Leave me alone!" the girl shouted, pushing her mother away. “I need to see Alexander," she insisted, pulling out the IV needles and trying to get out of bed. But the nurses and doctors arrived just in time to restrain her.

“Get a grip on yourself, Ariana!" her mother shouted, trying to bring her to her senses, but the girl continued to scream.

"I need to see Alexander! Alexander! Alexander!" she cried until the doctors injected her with a-sedative, and she drifted back into unconsciousness.
###Chapter 97

Two years later, in a hidden and remote base,deep within one of the underground rooms designed for torment, the agonizing cries of a man being subjected to extreme pain echoed through the chamber.His voice was filled with sheer terror as a scorching blade was driven into his palm,the searing pain too overwhelming to endure.

Alexander stood there, observing as his men relentlessly inflicted unimaginable suffering upon the man.

“Boss,he's passed out.," Max reported.

“Then bring him back around," Alexander responded with cold detachment.

Max hesitated, wanting to point out that the man had already endured more than enough. But when he caught the icy glare in Alexander's eyes,the words died in his throat. Swallowing hard, Max quickly grabbed another burning blade from the fire and plunged it into the man's other arm, jolting him back into consciousness with a scream of agony.

This man, once a trusted business associate in Alexander's shadowy world,had dared to betray him. Now, he served as a stark warning to others who might consider such treachery.

After a prolonged session of torure, Alexander finally gave the signal for Max to stop. "Lock him up in one of the darkest cells," Alexander commanded."Right away, Boss," Max replied. Checking his watch. Alexander noted that it was almost time for his daughter's important day. Today marked Viola's fifth birthday, an event she had been eagerly anticipating for weeks. If he lingered any longer at the base, he would be late for the grand celebration.

At one of Kane's most opulent ballrooms, preparations were in full swing for Viola's birthday celebration. Guests were expected to start arriving around 8 PM.


Alexander and Nuella had gone to great lengths to ensure their daughter's fifth birthday was everything she had dreamed of. Her favorite characters were invited, her friends were on the guest list, and family members were all set to attend.

Though primarily a children's event, many adults viewed it as an opportunity to attend a prestigious gathering hosted by the influential Alexander Kane.


A year prior, Alexander and Nuella had decided that Viola should resume attending aprivate school, as the threats to her life had subsided. They wanted her to interact with other children her age and begin forming friendships.


Every one of her classmates had received an invitation to the party,including her teacher and the principal of the newly established elite school. The old school had been permanently closed after the kidnapping incident two years ago. Parents of her classmates seized the opportunity to attend the party,hoping to establish connections with the Kane family. Many other influential figures, whose children attended the same school as Vioa,went to great lengths to secure an invitation. As the clock struck 8 PM, guests began arriving in their luxurious vehicles. Photographers and reporters swarmed the venue, eager to capture the event. What was intended as a children's party had transformed into a major social event for the elite, whose children shared a classroom with Viola Kane.


Viola, now referred to as the "Golden Child," became the center of attention as her fifth birthday celebration drew nationwide interest.

"If this is how much attention her fifth birthday is getting, imagine the global buzz when she turns sixteen or eighteen," one reporter commented during a live broadcast.


“Indeed, we wouldn't expect anything less from the only child of Alexander Kane, the most powerful businessman in the country,and Lily Kane,the most successful businesswoman," another journalist agreed.

Caleb Blake, Viola's great-grandfather, attended the grand celebration along with her great-grandmother. Helen Kane, and her aunt, Sandra Kane.Richard and Sophia arrived with their two-year-old son.

sarah, Viola's godmother, wouldn't have missed her goddaughter's birthday for the world. She and Anthony made sure to arrive in the city just in time for the event.


Everyone close to Viola had arrived and presented her with gifts, but her father was still absent. Despite her mother assuring her that Alexander would arrive soon, he still hadn't shown up.


Viola's mood darkened as her friends began to notice her unhappiness.It was her special day, yet instead of being filled with joy and excitement,she seemed preoccupied and sad.

"What's wrong. Viola?" one of her friends asked. "Nothing," Viola responded in a melancholic tone before walking away to find a quiet spot, behaving more like an adult than a child. She didn't want to interrupt her mother, who was deep in conversation with her godmother.

Several security guards followed as she sought out a secluded area to call her father, whose absence was now causing her distress. Viola found her father's number in her phone and dialed it. The call connected after just a few rings.

“Viola,” Alexander answered, a smile evident in his voice as he waited to hear his daughter.

“Daddy,why aren't you here yet?" she demanded, frustration evident.

His smile grew; only Viola and her mother could elicit such a warm reaction from him. "I'm sorry, sweetheart. I got caught in traffic but will be there soon.”"


"That's because you didn't leave work on time, Daddy! It's my big day,"she scolded him again.

"Yes, it is, my love. I'll be there shortly."

“You did get my present,right?"

"I wouldn't forget it for the world."

Viola smiled, reassured. "Okay, Daddy. I love you. See you1 soon.”

"I love you too," Alexander replied, blowing her akiss through the phone before ending the call.

Viola beamed with happiness as she returned to the ballroom, with her guards in tow.

Meanwhile, at the international airport of Aurora City, a woman with brunette hair stepped out of the terminal, dressed in all black with sunglasses that drew the attention of onlookers. A luxury car awaited her outside.


“Welcome back, ma'am," her bodyguard greeted her with a bow, opening the car door.

Ariana removed her sunglasses and smiled. She glanced around, taking a deep breath. “It's good to be home," she said before sliding into the car.

The bodyguard quickly took his place behind the wheel.

“Where to,ma'am?”

She looked at him from the back seat. "To the hotel first, then to the event.”

“Ma'am, you're still planning to attend the event?" The bodyguard was unsure of her intentions.

"Yes, of course. I have an invitation, so it's only right that I go. It would be quite rude to miss the celebration of their Golden Child," Ariana replied with a sly smile.
###Chapter 98

Ariana arrived at a newly constructed luxury hotel, a striking twenty-story building that had recently been added to the Blake Hotel Company's portfolio. She had meticulously planned her stay well in advance, ensuring that the prestigious presidential suite on the top floor would be reserved for her. Her bodyguard, Samson, respectfully opened the car door for her,allowing her to step out and take in the sight of the towering structure before her.


"Thank you, Samson," she acknowledged, her tone carrying a note of authority,before she confidently strode towards the entrance of the grand establishment, with Samson following closely behind.

As soon as Ariana crossed the threshold of the hotel, she was welcomed by the sight of a magnificent crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling, its radiant light casting an inviting warmth throughout the lavishly decorated lobby. The floors, crafted from pristine marble, exuded an air of opulence,while the gentle melodies of a grand piano playing in the background added a sophisticated touch to the ambiance.

An elegantly dressed doorman greeted her with a courteous smile,promptly arranging for her luggage to be handled with the utmost care.Ariana made her way to the reception desk, where a group of highly trained staff members attended to her needs with the highest level of professionalism and respect. After completing the check-in process, one of the staff members,wearing white gloves, presented her with a gleaming gold key card, a symbol of the exclusive privileges that awaited her. The concierge, eager to ensure her stay was nothing short of perfect, offered to assist with anyreservations or special arrangements she might require. With anticipation, Ariana entered the elevator and ascendedI to the highest floors, where her suite awaited. The corridor leading to her destination was adorned with exquisite artwork, each piece a testament to wealth and cultural sophistication, setting the stage for the luxury she was about to experience.

Upon entering the presidential suite, Ariana was immediately captivated by the breathtaking views of the city visible through the expansive floor-to-ceiling windows. The suite's living area was furnished with luxurious pieces in rich hues, complemented by plush carpets and a chandelier that mirrored the grandeur of the one in the lobby below. A grand dining table was positioned adjacent to a state-of-the-art kitchen, perfectly suited for hosting private gatherings of the highest caliber.

The bedroom was a sanctuary of comfort and elegance, featuring a king-sized bed dressed in the finest linens. The en-suite bathroom was nothing short of spectacular, boasting a Jacuzzi tub, marble countertops, and an array of high-end toiletries. A private terrace extended from the suite,offering a secluded space where Ariana could relax while enjoying sweeping views of the city skyline.

As she settled into her lavish surroundings, Ariana couldn't help but acknowledge the exceptional quality of the Blake Hotel. She mused over the remarkable taste and business acumen of the hotel's visionary,Alexander's wife, who had overseen the entire project. A smile played on Ariana's lips as she thought about the upcoming reunion with Alexander,a moment she had long anticipated. The prospect of reclaiming what she believed was rightfully hers filled her with determination. Ariana rose to freshen up and prepare for the evening's banquet,when her phone began to ring. A frown creased her forehead as she glanced at the screen, recognizing her mother's number. Although she deeply cared for her mother, she often found her overly concerned and somewhat intrusive,especially considering that she was a grown woman of thirty-three who didn't need to be told how to live her life.

Her mother had been vehemently opposed to her returning to Country A,urging her instead to move on from her past with Alexander. But for Ariana, moving on was impossible; Alexander was the center of her world,the onething she desired above all else. She had made a gravemistake years ago, betraying him for the sake of her family, but now she was determined to seek his forgiveness and gradually work her way back into his life, regardless of whether he was married or not.

The phone continued to ring until Ariana finally answered with a curt,"What is it?"

"Ariana," her mother's voice came through the line,filled with concern.

"Mother," Ariana responded, her tone edged with impatiece.

Mrs. Martins sighed deeply. "So, you're not going to change your mind?"

"No."

"Very well then. If that's the case, I'm coming to Country A to be with you.It's been two years since you came out of that coma, but your body hasn't fully recovered yet. I need to be there to take care of you."

A smile tugged at Ariana's lips. "Now you're talking sense, Mother." "Since you just arrived, you should rest," her mother suggested. "Rest?" Ariana chuckled softly. "I'll rest after I've attended the banquet.I can't miss making my grand entrance for anything in the world." "What banquet are you talking about?" her mother inquired,puzzled.

"The one for Alexander's child. I received an invitation," Ariana revealed,her voice laced with anticipation.

"What? How did you...?"

"Get an invitation?" Ariana finished the question her mother was about to ask.


"Yes."

"You won't believe who invited me, Mother."

"Who?"

"Lily Blake herself," Ariana said with a laugh, enjoying the shock she imagined on her mother's face.

Carolina was stunned. "How...?" Carolina knew all too well that Lily was Alexander's wife, and the couple was a constant topic of conversation online. How on earth did her daughter get an invitation from someone who should be her rival?

"I'll explain everything when you arrive in the country, but for now,I need to get ready. I can't afford to be late." With that, Ariana ended the call and moved to prepare herself for the banquet. Carolina stared at the now silent phone, a deep sense of unease settling in her heart. She had heard countless stories about Alexander's ruthlessness,and she was well aware that during Ariana's university days, her daughter had often spoken of how merciless Alexander could be towards his enemies. Carolina could only hope that when Ariana saw the reality of the situation,she would realize the futility of her quest and give up.




Meanwhile, at the banquet, Alexander's entrance immediately commanded attention. He was admired by many men his age who aspired to achieve his level of success, and numerous women envied Lily, wishing they could experience the love and devotion Alexander showered on her. Even the children present, attending what was ostensibly a celebration for Viola,couldn't help but feel as though it was their own party due to the grandeur of the event.

All éyes were on Alexander as he made his way to Lily, greeting her with a kiss in full view of the assembled guests.

"What took you so long?" Lily playfully chided him.

"Traffic," he replied simply.

"Alright," Lily said. placing her hand affectionately on his chest. "You look very handsome in this suit."


"And you look stunning in that dress," Alexander complimented her,causing Lily to blush.

He kissed her forehead tenderly. "Where's Viola? "I'll go see her now," Alexander said, kissing Lily's forehead once more before heading towards where Viola was seated, happily indulging in her dessert. Alexander chuckled as he approached his daughter, crouching down to her level and wrapping his arms around her small frame. "Happy birthday,my little girl."

"Daddy!" Viola squealed in delight, her hands, covered in cake, landing squarely on her father's face.

"Ooh," Viola blinked in surprise at the mess she had inadvertently made."Let me clean it!" she declared, using her tongue to lick the cake off his face.

Lily watched the heartwarming scene with a smile, feeling a deep sense of contentment as she observed the two most important people in her life.

Alexander laughed at his daughter's antics. "My girl is absolutely adorable."

"And beautiful," Lily added.

"Yes, and beautiful," Alexander agreed, pressing a kiss to Viola's forehead.

He then presented her with the gift he had brought, which quickly became the topic of conversation among the guests. The hotel where the banquet was held was now registered in Viola's name, along with a vacation house on the island she had dreamed of visiting during the holidays.Additionally, Alexander had gifted her a diamond necklace, personalized
with her name and the names of her parents. The party continued with Alexander and Lily sharing a dance with Viola on the dance floor until the atmosphere was disrupted by the arrival of an unexpected guest. Ariana made her entrance in an opulent gown that exuded luxury.The dress, crafted from the finest silk in a deep, regal shade of sapphire,featured intricate gold embroidery that shimmered under the ambient light of the banquet hall. The attire made her feel as though she was the true star of the event.

As she stepped into the room, heads turned and gasps were heard as guests took in the sight of the stunning woman who had just arrived.None of them recognized her, leading to hushed whispers as they speculated about her identity, assuming she must be one of the country's many mysterious billionaires.

The collective murmuring caught the attention of Alexander and Lily,prompting them to look towards the entrance. Alexander's eyes widened in disbelief as he recognized Ariana, alive and standing before him.

Ethan and Richard were equally shocked, their expressions mirroring Alexander's astonishment.

"Dear God," Ethan muttered, the glass of wine slipping from his hand and shattering on the floor. "Isshe a ghost? How can this be?"

"This is beyond belief," Richard whispered, pinching himself to ensure he wasn't dreaming. "She wvas supposed to be dead."

Lily, unaware of the history between Ariana and Alexander, smiled warmly.She had met Ariana during a business trip, and they had later signed a contract for a new venture together. Little did Lily know, she had unwittingly made the gravest mistake of her life. Lily stared at Alexander with wide eyes, shocked by his actions. Why did he push Ariana, especially in front of everyone, including their child? "Alexander, what's wrong?" Lily asked,grabbing his hand.
###Chapter 99
To say Alexander was shocked would be an understatement-he was absolutely livid when he saw Ariana standing before him, very much alive.The way she smiled at Lily made him clench his fists tightly.

"How could she be alive after all these 14 years without me knowing? This is unbelievable!" Alexander fumed silently.

Ethan and Richard noticed the fury on Alexander's face. They both knew that given the chance, he wouldn't hesitate to take revenge on the woman who had the audacity to betray him before fleeing.

Ariana did her best to avoid looking at Alexander, instead focusing solely on Lily, whom she smiled at. Had they met before? The thought made him tighten his fists even more. Lily smiled back at Ariana, which only caused Alexander to raise an eyebrow in suspicion.

Ariana approached and hugged Lily. "Hello Lily, thank you for inviting me," she said with a smile. Alexander's face darkened with rage, and he immediately pushed Ariana away from Lily.

Ariana stumbled to the floor, causing a collective gasp from everyone in the banquet hall. Even Ethan and Richard were taken aback by Alexander's reaction-they knew how much he despised Ariana for what she had done, but they didn't expect him to act so openly until the crowd had dispersed."She has no business being here! How could you have met her without me knowing?" Alexander demanded, his anger palpable.

Lily let go of his hand and went to Ariana. "Miss Martins, are you alright?"

Tears streamed down Ariana's face as she sniffled, looking at Alexander,who was glaring at her with a deadly intensity. "Why did you do that?What did I do wrong?" she asked, her tears flowing freely.

The onlookers began whispering among themselves. They were well aware of Alexander Kane's ruthless reputation, but they had never seen him act out like this before.


Alexander marched over and pulled Lily away. "Stay away from her. Do I make myself clear?" he warned sternly.

Lily was more confused than ever. What exactly was happening? Did Alexander know Miss Martins? Her gaze shifted to Ariana, who was being helped up by her bodyguard, Samson.

"Do you know her?" Lily asked Alexander, but he remained silent. It was at that moment that he realized he had never told Lily about his past, so there was no way she could know about Ariana.

"Alexander, talk to me," Lily insisted, her patience wearing thin.While it seemed clear that Alexander knew who Ariana was, it appeared Ariana did not recognize him. In the background, Peter turned to Caleb, "Father, I think wve should leave.Sooner or later, Alexander is going to end this party." Caleb nodded in agreement, still trying to figure out who the woman was.Judging by Alexander's reaction, she was clearly someone from his past. As they exited the banquet hall and got into the car, Caleb instructed Victor, his right-hand man, to investigate everything about the woman who had just arrived.

Back in the banquet hall, Alexander still hadn't answered Lily's question.

"Max." Alexander called out.

"Yes,boss?"

"Tell the chauffeur to take Grandma, Sandra, and Viola home."

"Viola too?" Lily questioned, surprised that Alexander wanted Viola to leave with Grandma Helen.

"Yes, she'll spend the night there," Alexander confirmed.


Lily was baffled by his sudden decisions.

"Right away, boss," Max responded, then promptly escorted Grandma Helen, Sandra, and Viola out. Viola said her goodbyes to her parents before leaving. Although she was just a child, she could sense the shift in her father's mood when that woman arrived, understanding that her father must deeply despise her. Viola wasn't upset that her party was ending early; she was already tired. Sophia also left with herson,while Sarah departed with Antony,her husband. Sarah was determined to question Antony later because it seemed like he knew who the woman was and why Alexander was so furious. "The celebrant has left. The party is over, everyone," Ethan announced.Their security team immediately began guiding guests outside. But,as expected, some reporters hid in the corners, eager to capture whatever might unfold between the Kanes and this mysterious woman.

Ariana appeared bewildered as she looked around, seeing only Alexander,Lily,Ethan,and Richard-whom she recognized.

"I'm confused. What's happening here, Lily? Did I unknowingly cause some sort of disturbance? And why did you push me like that,Mr.Kane?Care to explain?" Ariana demanded, her voice tinged with anger.

"And why did the party end as soon as I arrived? Lily, can you please tell me what's going on? I didn't travel all the way from Europe to be humiliated like this," she added, clearly irritated.

Ethan and Richard exchanged puzzled looks. Was she not the Ariana they remembered? Could they have madea mistake? It seemed like she didn't recognize Alexander or them.

Lily waited for Alexander to respond, but it was Ethan who finally spoke up.

"Miss Ariana Martins," he called out.

Ariana turned to him with a puzzled expression.′′Yes?′′

"That's your name, correct?" Ethan asked as he stepped closer to her.

"Yes,it is."

Ethan stopped just in front of her. "Then you're the Ariana from years ago." "University? Betrayed?" Lily murmured to herself. She glanced at Richard,who nodded, confirming her suspicions. Richard had previously mentioned the woman Alexander first loved and how she had betrayed him. Now it turns out Ariana was that woman. But how could she still be alive? Richard had told her she died in a plane crash while fleeing after Alexander discovered her betrayal. Lily was shocked that she had unknowingly befriended the same woman. Ariana's face was blank with confusion. "What are you talking about? This is my first time in Country A. I may be from here, but I grew up in Europe." Now she understood Alexander's anger. She looked at him and saw that his rage had not subsided, and from the look on his face, it seemed he would rip Ariana apart if given the chance."Don't yell at me!" she snapped back.

"So you're saying you don't recognize me?"

"This is the first time I'm meeting you."

"Alright," Ethan nodded, then gestured towards Richard. "What about him?Do you recognize him?"

Ariana looked at Richard, but her expression was blank."I don't know him. For heaven's sake, this is my first time in Country A."

"And what about him?" Ethan pointed at Alexander, who was still holding Lily tightly.

Ariana turned her gaze to Alexander. "Yes, I know who he is. He's Alexander Kane, Lily's husband, and aš a businesswoman, I'm well aware that he's one of the wealthiest men in Country A."

Ethan shook his head. "Look at him closely, Ariana. Do you not remember Alexander from university and how you betrayed him?" Ariana studied Alexander again, this time more intently, feeling a wave of emotion but maintaining her composure. "I don't remember. What exactly are you talking about? I studied in Europe, and I have no idea what betrayal you're referring to."

"Try again," Richard urged.

Ariana acted as if she were trying to recall something,clutching her head as if in pain. "I'm sorry, but I can't remember anything. Ahh, my head hurts!" she screamed, holding her head in agony.

"Ma'am!" Samson, who had been standing nearby, rushed to support her before she could collapse. "Ma'am, are you alright?"

"No, please get me out of here," she said weakly.

"Yes,ma'am."

Samson lifted her and carried her out of the hall.

It felt as if they were watching a drama unfold before their eyes.Ethan was speechless. Was she pretending, or had she genuinely lost her memory?

He turned to look at Alexander, who was glaring at the exit, his fists clenched tightly.

"Alexander, I think it's time you told me everything you've kept from me,"Lily said to him. Alexander gazed at her and nodded. "I will when we get home,"he promised, then turned to Ethan.Ethan understood immediately and nodded. They needed to investigate Ariana thoroughly-how she was still alive after all these years and why they were unaware until she appeared today.

Samson placed Ariana in the backseat of the car before getting into the driver's seat and driving off. Once they were away from the hotel, Ariana removed her hand from her head and sat up straight, a smile playing on her lips as she stared out the window.

"Ma'am, should I take you to the hospital?" Samson asked, still concerned.

Ariana smiled. "I'm fine."

Samson glanced at her through therearview mirror. "What you did in there was something else, ma'am. You had me convinced for a moment that you had really lost your memory. I thought you were suffering from temporary amnesia, but it turns out it was all an act."

"So should I head back to the hotel?"

"No."

"Where to,ma'am?"

"The hospital."

"But you said you're fine."

"Yes, I'm fine." "Then why are we going to the hospital,ma'am?" "Because I need to keep playing the victim. Alexander pushed me to the floor, and the reporters stayed until the end to record everything, including when you rushed me out," Ariana said, having noticed the reporters hiding in the corners. "Reporters?" Samson asked, surprised since he hadn't seen any.

"You need to be as observant as I am, Samson," she smiled.

Everything that happened today had worked in her favo.Now,Alexander and Lily would undoubtedly have a heated argument, especially since it seemed Alexander had kept his past a secret from her.

"But ma'am, was it necessary to pretend you lost your memory? What if they find out?" Samson was concerned, knowing the whole story and realizing that his boss was in the wrong for having betrayed Alexander.


Ariana smiled confidently. "Like I said, the reporters and the guests witnessed everything. By tomorrow morning, the news will be all over it,portraying Alexander as the villain while I come off as the victim.When they learn I'm in the hospital, the entire city will be buzzing with interest.All of Alexander and Lily's detractors will criticize them for treating me poorly, which will cause their stock to plummet and create chaos in their respective companies.

"And when the whole city discovers that they bullied a woman who lost her memory and recently woke up from a 12-year coma, they'll despise them even more. That's when I'll step in as their hero by doing an interview," Ariana smirked as she revealed her plan to Samson.
###Chapter 100

"Welcome back, ma'am. Welcome back, sir," Clara and the other maids greeted them, but they were completely ignored by Alexander and Lilly,who both wore expressions of anger. The maids wondered what had occurred during Viola's birthday to bring them home so early.

When Clara didn't see Viola with them, she approached Pedro, one of the bodyguards, and he informed her that Viola had been taken to the family residence to stay with her great-grandmother and aunt.

Lilly stormed into the room and slammed the door behind her. Alexander quickly followed, pushing the door open to enter.

"How could you possibly meet her and even sign a business contract with her!" Alexander was furious. They had,been arguing the entire way home in the car.


"Maybe if you'd been honest with me from the beginning, I would have known that the same woman was from your past, but instead,you kept everything from me," Lilly retorted.

"She was supposed to be dead, Lilly! Ariana died in a plane crash. For all these years, I would have known if she was alive. And now, out of nowhere, she reappears, pretending to have lost her memory,"Alexander shot back. Lilly stared at him in silence. He was right; he had kept this from her until now. "What if she really did lose her memory?" Lilly asked, unable to shake the feeling that it was all too real. Alexander frowned at her words. "Do you think her meeting you in Europe was just a coincidence? She doesn't even have the accent. How could you fall for such a scam? I knowyou're smarter than that."

"Not everyone has the accent. Besides, she told me she was from Country
A and spoke with our accent. So yes, I believed her. And the main reason I signed a business contract with her was because of her sharp business acumen. She's good at what she does, and I wanted to work with her."

"You're not doing business with her anymore," Alexander declared.

Lilly sat on the bed, lost in thought. Everything that had happened felt surreal. A person they believed to be dead had suddenly reentered their lives. "We already signed the contract. Breaking it without fulfilling our obligations will be difficult."

"I don't care how difficult it is. The last thing I want is her getting close to the people I care about,especially you."

Lilly gazed at him. "Do you think I want to do business with her after finding out who she is? I don't, Alexander. But now, I have no choice. If I don't fulfill my part of the deal, I'll be sued."

"Let me handle it," Alexander sat beside her, placing his hand on hers."Don't do anything. I'll deal with her," he said softly.

Lilly pulled her hand away. "Fine. I'm going to sleep, but I won't sleep here tonight." Alexander grabbed her arm. "Why not? Where are you planning to sleep?" "The guest room." "And why do you want to sleep elsewhere?" Alexander's tone grew harsher. "Because I need to be alone. A lot happened today."

Alexander pulled her onto his lap, wrapping his arms around her waist."You don't need to sleep elsewhere. I'll give you space if you need it,but only if you sleep here."

Lilly didn't argue further and got up to go to the bathroom.

Once she left. Alexander made a call to Ethan to get updates on wha he had found out.


The next day, the entire internet was abuzz with the events that had unfolded at the Kane family banquet. Reporters had not hesitated to post videos of Alexander pushing Ariana away from Lilly, causing her to fall to the floor, and recordings of Ethan, a friend of Alexander Kane,interrogating and bullying her.

"Attendance at the banquet was strictly by invitation, so she must have had one. The way the lady, Ariana Martins, hugged Mrs. Kane showed they were familiar with each other. But Alexander Kane pushing the woman away from his wife shocked everyone, including me,who was present. Because of that same lady, Alexander Kane ended his child's party and had his friend, Ethan, interrogate her. According to the audio, Ethan was heard asking the lady if she didn't recognize them, but she insisted she didn't know him, Alexander Kane,and Richard Williams. They talked about her betraying Alexander years ago during their university days. Ariana Martins fainted and was rushed to the hospital by her bodyguard after the confrontation. As we speak,she's at the central hospital," the reporter announced in the morning's live TV broadcast.  The broadcast sparked a flood of hateful comments aimed at Lilly and
Alexander. People who disapproved of their marriage created fake accounts to post negative remarks.

Within hours, Ariana, who had just arrived in Country A the night before,became infamous as the woman bullied by the Kanes, drawing sympathy and public attention. Her notoriety grew, and she began to amass a following of anti-fans who opposed Alexander and Lilly. These supporters formed groups to attack the couple and counter the defenses put up by Alexander's fans.


Amidst all the drama, Ariana couldn't help but smile and laugh as she read the news and comments on her phone. She had only just begun, but she already had significant support. It seemed it wouldn't be long before she could challenge Lilly's place as Alexander's wife, gradually winning back his trust.


As she reveled in the chaos, Samson, her bodyguard, entered her hospital room,interrupting her moment of satisfaction.

Ariana snapped at him, "What is it?"

"Apologies, ma'am, but you need to see this," Samson handed her his tablet.

Her eyes widened as she looked at the screen, then she burst into laughter,jumping up in excitement.
 
"Oh my God! This is amazing! I love this!" Ariana was ecstatic. The stock prices of Kane Corporation and the Blake Group were plummeting rapidly. She had expected this, but the speedI of the decline surprised her.Ariana grinned, "Everything is going according to plan. Now all I have to do is wait for Alexander to come see me."

"See you?" Samson asked, confused.

"Yes, I'm sure he's already on his way to this hospital right now," Ariana said with a gleeful smile. She couldn't wait for the confrontation.

Samson became alarmed. "Why would he come here, ma'am?"

"To strangle me," she smirked.

"Strangle you?" Samson was taken aback. "Then we should inform the police for your safety."


"Shut up!" Ariana screamed at him. "You're not doing anything. I want you out of here when he arrives. One thing Alexander hates is seeing something he's worked so hard to build over the years fall apart.His company means everything to him, and the fact that the stock market is crashing will make him want to strangle me."

"But what if he doesn't comne?"

"He will. I'm certain of it," Ariana said confidently as she looked at her watch,eagerly waiting for Alexander to walk through the door.
 
###Chapter 101

Lily watched in dismay as the value of Blake Group's stocks continued to plummet on her tablet screen. The downturn wasn't limited to the main company; it extended to its other branches as well. The scandal surrounding her family had severely impacted their businesses. Her phone buzzed, and it was her grandfather calling. Though she hesitated,she knew avoiding the call would only leadto more persistent attempts.Resigned, she answered,“Grandfather.”

"What's your plan to fix this? Our stock prices are dropping, and I refuse to let them be sold off cheaply. I didn't spend all these years building this up just to see it crumble over a minor incident. Handle it. I don't know who that woman is, but she's going to cause trouble!"

“I'll take care of it, Grandfather,” Lily assured him before he ended the call.

Caleb then turned to Victor. “Did you gather everything about her?”

“Yes, sir,” Victor replied, handing over a file. Caeb reviewed it and commented,“Ariana Martins... she's the daughter of the late Rowland Martins, whose business nearly went under but was mysteriously saved from bankruptcy."

Victor confirmed, “Indeed, sir. According to this, his daughter devised a strategy that pulled them out of financial ruin, but it involved stealing something from Alexander and giving it to their rival. In return, the rival resolved their financial problems. When Alexander found out, he pursued her, but she managed to escape-only to end up in a plane crash."

Caleb listened as V/ictor recounted the details, noting, "The reports claimned she died."

"Yes, that's the story her family put out, even staging a fake funeral with a decoy body."

"They were terrified of Alexander, even at his young age," Caleb mused.


“Indeed, sir. Alexander had already amassed significant power by the age of 21.”


"She's managed to stay hidden all these years and has only resurfaced now. I need you to discover what she's been doing all this time and what she's planning." Caleb ordered.

Victor bowed, “Yes,sir.”

Caleb couldn't shake the feeling that Ariana would be a serious issue.

After the call with her grandfather, Lily paced her office, contemplating her next move when her assistant, Katrina, entered.

"Ma'am, the stock price of Kane Corporation has dropped even more than ours,"Katrina informed her.

“What? Let me see," Lily demanded, taking the tablet and gasping at how much Kane Corporation's value had plunged.

“Oh my God," she muttered in disbelief. The aftermath of the party incident was catastrophic. With some subsidiary stock prices so low,anyone could afford to buy them now.

She attempted to call Alexander, but his phone wasn't connecting. She tried James' number as well, with the same result. They must be busy managing the crisis. Knowing Alexander, Lily was certain he would want to confront Ariana.

Without hesitation, she grabbed her handbag and headed for the door.

“Ma'am, are you going to Kane Corporation?" Katrina asked,trailing behind.


"Yes, I need to see my husband," Lily repled.


“But ma'am, we need to address our own stock situation; we're facing the same crisis.”


Lily paused, turning to Katrina with a stern expression. Katrina swallowed,realizing she might have overstepped.

“If you really want to solve this, I need you to follow these instructions,"
Lily said,giving Katrina detailed orders before heading to Kane's headquarters on her own. She was taken aback by the swarm of reporters outside the building. As soon as they spotted her car, they rushed toward it, but she quickly maneuvered into the underground garage and drove to
a secure area.

Alexander had anticipated her arrival and deployed a team of guards to escort her inside.

“Welcome, ma'am," the guards greeted her with bowed heads as they guided her ínto, the building.

They led her to Alexander's private elevator, ensuring she didn't encounter the frantic employees in the building. Arriving at his office, she knocked before entering.

“My love, you don't need to knock," Alexander said warmly,catching her off guard.

She approached him cautiously, noticing his composed demeanor. Despite

the chaos, he appeared unfazed, as though his company wasn't facing a severe financial blow.


He shifted his gaze from the computer screen to her,“Come here,”he beckoned. Still taken aback by his calmness, Lily walked around the desk and stood before him. He pulled her onto his lap, wrapping his arms around her waist.


She hadn't expected him to be so relaxed. If he was this composed, then he must be planning something significant. She noticed his suit was buttoned, indicating he was about to leave before hearing she had arrived.

“Don't worry, I'll handle this soon," Alexander reassured her.

“No, I'll do it,” Lily insisted.

Alexander met her eyes,“Do what?”

"What you were planning to do-meet Ariana and confront her,right?”Lily challenged.

Alexander's silence confirmed her suspicion.

“I don't want you near her anymore," Alexander stated.

"The source of the problem is the key to fixing it," Lily argued. “And I don't want you interacting with her because that's exactly what she wants.We don't even know if she really lost her memory; this could all be a ploy to lure you in, and you almost fell for it, Alexander," she said, clearly irritated.

"Ariana wants to compete with me, and the last thing I want is for you to play into her hands," Lily admitted.

Alexander considered her words and nodded, agreeing to let her take charge.

Meanwhile, at Aurora City Central Hospital, Ariana was in high spirits. It was the best day she'd had since waking from her coma. As she ate her meal, she gleefully read the negative online comments about Lily and Alexander,occasionally glancing at the clock, wondering why Alexander hadn't shown up yet. Given the drastic drop in his company's stock, she expected him to confront her in a fury by now.

She kept looking toward the door and even instructed Samson,stationed outside, to inform her when Alexander arrived. An hour passed with no sign of him, and her patience was wearing thin. She began considering how to compel him to visit.

Just as she reached for her phone, the hospital door opened, and Lily entered.

Ariana looked up in surprise, expecting Alexander and seeing Lily instead.

Lily closed the door, her gaze locked on Ariana's shocked expression.

“You weren't expecting me, were you?" Lily asked, her voice laced with confidence.

Ariana was at a loss for words.
 
###Chapter 102

Ariana was not expecting Lily to show up instead of Alexander, and the surprise left her momentarily stunned. Lily smiled as she approached Ariana on her hospital bed. "You seem shocked to see me, Miss Martins.Were you anticipating someone else to walk through that door?"

Ariana smiled back. "Yes, I'm surprised you're here. Given the turmoil at Kane Corporation, I didn't think you'd have the time to visit me in the hospital. I assumed you'd be too busy handling the situation. But since you made the time, I feel quite honored and special." Ariana placed her hand on her chest, feigning gratitude.

Lily smiled as she gracefully sat in a nearby chair, crossing her legs with poise. As Ariana observed Lily, a surge of envy washed over her. Despite Lily's simple attire-office pants, a cream silk blouse, black heels,and a ponytail-she exuded elegance, grace, and beauty. Ariana couldn't help but resent Lily for having everything she had ever wanted: the man she loved,a complete family, and a beauty that could dIrive anyone wild. Clenching her fists under the duvet, Ariana forced a smile as Lily returned the gesture.

"Is there a particular reason you're here, Lily?"

"Lily?" Lily arched a brow. Before discovering that Ariana had been Alexander's past love, Lily had allowed her to use her first name. But now,she wouldn't permit it any longer. "Mrs. Kane. You should address me as Mrs. Kane-that's my name to you."

Ariana frowned inwardly. Acknowledging Lily as Mrs. Kane meant accepting her as Alexander's wife, something Ariana didn't want to do,though she had no choice now. "Mrs. Kane," Ariana finally said, forcing a

smile. "But I thought we were close-you even invited me to your daughter's birthday party."

"Any relationship we have is strictly business, Miss Martins."

Ariana nodded. "If you say so. So, why are you here?"

Lily leaned back in her chair. "You're surely aware of the chaos that unfolded today-how the incident at the party yesterday went viral,causing mayhem and impacting the stock prices of both Kane Corporation and my family's empire."

"I saw it, and I wish there was something I could do since it's all happening because of me," Ariana replied, feigning sadness.

Lily observed her for a moment before smiling inwardly. "I'm glad you're willing to help resolve it."

"What do you mean?" Ariana asked, confused.

Lily stood up and made a call. "Have they arrived?" she asked, receiving confirmation from the other end. "Good," she responded before ending the call.

A knock at the door was followed by Katrina entering with several shopping bags. Ariana watched in confusion, unsure of what Lily was planning. Lily placed the bags near her. "The reporters are already at the hospital entrance. You'll need to prepare yourself with one of these outfits because you're about to be interviewed."

"Why would I need to do that?" Ariana asked.

"You said you wanted to help resolve the crisis. I need you to go on that interview and tell everyone that yesterday's incident was a

misunderstanding."

Ariana clenched her fists under the duvet. "But I was genuinely pushed by Mr. Kane without cause. Shouldn't he apologize first to help resolve the issue?"


"You know very well why he pushed you, Ariana. A person who betrayed him years ago suddenly appears, hugging his wife."


Ariana shook her head. "I've told you all before that I don't know what you're talking about. You're confusing me-I can't remember anything!"she shouted, trying to sound convincing.

Samson entered the room to ensure they weren't harming her. "I think it's best you leave, ma'am," he said, indicating the door.

Tears streamed down Ariana's face as she looked at Lily, who stared back at her. "You don't remember anything?" Lily asked, ignoring Samson completely.

Ariana nodded. "When I woke up from a coma two years ago, the only things I remembered were my name and some childhood memories. That's how I recognized my mother, who cared for me during the 12 years I was in a coma."

"You've been in a coma for twelve years?" Lily was taken aback by this revelation.

"Yes, and according to my mother, I survived a plane crash thanks to expert doctors. So, you see, I don't remember anything you're accusing me of," Ariana said innocently, wiping away her tears.

Lily processed this new information. "I don't believe what you're saying-you've shown no proof. But that aside, you need to get dressed. I don't
care what you plan to say to the reporters, but make sure it's enough to get us out of this crisis," Lily said with the authority of a boss addressing a subordinate.

"We'll wait outside for you," Lily said as she and Katrina left the room.

After they exited, Ariana gritted her teeth and clenched her fists. She wanted to scream but knew they'd hear her. She had expected to do an interview eventually. but not under Lily's terms. Her plan to have Alexander confront her and capture a video of him mistreating her had failed. She had hoped the situation would worsen before she gave the interview on her own terms.

After dressing in one of the outfits Lily had bought, Ariana stepped outside, and they proceeded to meet the reporters waiting outside the hospital. The moment they saw her, the reporters rushed toward her.

"Miss Martins! Miss Martins! Could you explain what happened yesterday at the party? Were you mistreated by the Kanes?" onereporter asked as they eagerly awaited her response.

Ariana glanced at Lily, who stood at a distance,watching her.

"There was a misunderstanding," Ariana finally said.

"What kind of misunderstanding would land you in the hospital?" another reporter asked.

"I have amnesia," Aríana responded, and cameras flashed as reporters began firing more questions.

"What do you mean you have amnesia?"

"How did it happen?"
The reporters bombarded her with questions, making it difficult for her to speak over the noise.

"Quiet!" Samson shouted, and the reporters fell silent,waiting for her to speak.

"Two years ago, I woke up from a 12-year coma. I was in a coma for twelve years," Ariana revealed.shocking everyone.

"Twelve years? How did that happen?" a reporter asked.

"When I woke up, the only person I recognized was my mother and a few childhood memories-everything else was gone. My mother told me I had been in a plane crash, and that I'd suffered burns on my face and body,which were later fixed with cosmetic surgery."

"For the past two years, I've been recovering from the coma and trying to remember the past I've forgotten. When I attended the banquet yesterday and was confronted by the Kanes, I suddenly developed a severe headache and felt weak since I'm not fully recovered. That's why I was rushed to the hospital."

The reporters shook their heads,feeling sorry for her.

"Can you tell us what they were questioning you about and why Alexander Kane pushed you?" one reporter asked.

"I was shocked when he suddenly pushed me," Ariana replied,her expression sad. "Then, a young man, who I believe was his friend, began interrogating me. He asked if I recognized Alexander and him, along with another man standing nearby. He asked if I remembered betraying Alexander Kane years ago."

"Betrayal?" the reporters echoed.
Ariana nodded,looking sorrowful. "They seemed convinced I had done something terrible to him in the past, which led to him pushing me away when I tried to hug Mrs. Kane. It was all so confusing. I can't remember anything from before the plane crash-all I want is to start a new life."

"If I've hurt anyone in the past, including Mr. Kane, I want to ask for your forgiveness. After waking up from a 12-year coma, all I want is to start fresh and live in peace," she said, tears rolling down her cheeks,evoking sympathy from the reporters.


Instead of resolving the situation, her interview only made things worse.The backlash grew, with more hateful comments flooding the internet. The company's crisis deepened as the Kanes were now labeled as bullies of the sick. Ariana, meanwhile, garnered even more pity.
###Chapter 103

The interview that was supposed to resolvethe issue only made things worse.


"Oh no, Ma'am, you have to see this," Katrina exclaimed, showing the latest online news.

Lily took the tablet and saw the extent of the damage caused by the interview.

"What are we going to do now, Ma'am?" Katrina asked, clearly worried about how they would manage this crisis.

Lily watched as the stock value plummeted; their company's shares were now nearly worthless. It was clear that their business rivals had been waiting for an opportunity to strike, and the situation with Ariana provided them with the perfect chance to do so.

Everyone had seen the interview, and her grandfather immediately reached out to his old contacts to see what could be done.

Alexander had watched the interview too but remained calm.

"Did you see the interview?" James asked as he entered Alexander's office.He had left his company and rushed over when he saw how bad things had become.

"The whole idea of the interview backfired. Now that Lily couldn't contain it, are you going to proceed with the plan you had in mind?"

Alexander looked at him calmly. "Did you get the information I asked for?""Yes."
"Where is the file?"

"I'didn't bring it since everything she said about being in a coma was true;it's the same information we already had."

"What about her claim of amnesia?"

"Tm having that investigated."

"And what about details on the hospital where she was during the coma.as well as what she's been doing since she woke up two years ago?"Alexander asked.


James scratched his head. "I'll get on it."

Alexander frowned. "Be quick about it before I lose my patience."

James sighed. "Damn it, today's Sunday. We should all be with our families, not running around trying to clean up this mess," he ranted.

Alexander just stared at him calmly from his executive chair,showing no signs of the crisis they were facing.

Seeing this, James sighed in frustration. "I'm sure you've got everything under control; otherwise,why are you so calm?"

"My wife will take care of this. By tomorrow morning, it'll be like none of this ever happened," Alexander said confidently.

"Haven't you seen the current state of your company? The interview made everything worse."

Alexander didn't respond, just stared at him. "She said she would handle it, and she will. So shut up before I kick you out of my office."
James knew better than to argue further and immediately fell silent. If Alexander trusted Lily to resolve the situation,then she would.

Ariana smiled as she read the news, knowing her words had exacerbated the situation. Now she would wait and see if Alexander wouldn't come to her and what Lily would do since she had done the interview.

Lily stood outside Ariana's hospital room. The hospital staff had informed her that Miss Martins was well enough to go home, but she had chosen to stay.

Lily considered confronting her about the interview but decided it was best to leave. What was done was done; now it was time to initiate Plan B.

She walked out of the hospital and received a call from Sarah.

"Hello,Sarah."

"Lily,how are you holding up?"

"I'm okay."

"With everything happening, I know you're not fine."

"I'm fine, trust me. I've faced worse,remember?"

Sarah sighed. "I know, but this time it's affecting the company. Ariana is up to no good; you should steer clear of her."

"I'll be fine,"

"We'lI talk later. Bye, Lily."

"Bye,Sarah."
Sarah ended the call and turned to Anthony with a frown. "You have a lot of connections; can't you do something?”

"I'm sure Alexander and Lily have it under control. This is just a minor setback for them," Anthony replied, working on his laptop.

Sarah frowned, walked over, and took the laptop from him.

"Not now, woman," Anthony said, annoyed.

"I'll give it back only if you agree to dig deeper into that woman called Ariana. I'm sure she hasn't lost her memory like she claims and has approached Lily with a plan. As their close friends, we should help them out. I have a bad feeling she's going to be trouble."

"Fine, I'll investigate her. Now, can I get my laptop back?"

Sarah was about to hand it over but hesitated.

"What now?" he asked,frowning.

"Me or the laptop?"

"Why are you being childish, Sarah?" Anthony sighed, feeling a headache coming on.

"I'm childish?" she asked,getting emotional.

Seeing her teary eyes made him regret his words. Anthony stood up and approached her. "I'm sorry, my love, that was a slip of the tongue. Of course, you're not childish, and I will always choose you over anything."he said,trying to comfort her.

He always forgot that her mood swings were part of her pregnancy.
After leaving the hospital, Lily went to the Kane family residence to pick up Viola.

"Mummy!" Viola rushed to her mother as she entered the living room.

Lily picked her up and hugged her tightly. "My baby is getting so heavy."

"I missed you, Mummy," she said, kissing her mother's cheek.

"I missed you too, my little princess," Lily said, feeling happy to see her daughter and kissing her forehead.

After they both had dinner with Grandma Helen, as Sandra was not around, they returned home.

After making sure Viola had taken her bath and was asleep, Lily got ready and left the house again around 8 p.m.

She went to the other side of the city to see Jacob. Jacob had a secret hideout where they conducted some of their underground activities.

She passed through several security checkpoints before taking the elevator to the underground.

"Lily,you're here."

"Yes, and I need your help, Jacob," Lily said, wasting no time. If they waited any longer, things could get worse.

Jacob knew what she meant and immediately nodded.

The following morning, every negative story about the Kanes and Blake vanished from the internet as if they had never existed.

Ariana searched through various onaline pages but couldn't find any of the
news from the previous day. Everything had completely disappeared,including videos from her interview. All the groups her newly formed fans had created also vanished, as did the anti-Kane groups.

What shocked Ariana even more was that no one was talking about it anymore.


She was further stunned when she saw that the stock prices of Kane Corporation and Blake Enterprises had returned to normal after news of their substantial philanthropic efforts was posted.

The only news now online was about their charitable activities in the country.

Ariana felt weak, unable to believe what had happened. It was as if she had woken up from a dream, like everything had been a nightmare.

She didn't know how it had been done, but she was certain it was Lily's doing. Alexander preferred more aggressive tactics.

She had severely underestimated Lily.

"You may be tough, Lily, but I will break you, no matter what," she said.gritting her teeth.
###Chapter 104

Upon learning of the recent developments, Caleb was impressed."I had no idea my granddaughter was capable of something like this," he remarked to Victor.


“She has a friend named Jacob who's highly skilled in hacking,"Victor explained.

“I've heard of him, but I didn't realize he had the ability to completely silence the internet, including the media. That's impressive," Caleb acknowledged, praising the young man even in his absence.

“Indeed. I wonder how they managed to pull it off. Perhaps Lily did something else to ensure they stopped discussing the issue. Now,all the news online highlights the positive contributions of both families to society,which has helped the stock prices recover."

"As for the stock prices, I'm sure there were many who bought in when they were low. Those individuals are quite fortunate," Caleb noted.

“Yes,sir.”

Lily tried to rise from the bed, but Alexander held her down with his arms.

"Alexander, let go," she protested, her strength depleted from the night before.

He shook his head.“No.”

Lily smiled and gave him a quick kiss.

“Not enough," Alexander said, shaking his head.
Lily grinned.“How about this?" She locked lips with him, deepening the kiss. Alexander rolled her over, intensifying the embrace. By the time they parted, she was breathless.

“Alexander, if you don't let me go, how am I supposed to get Viola ready for school?” She pouted.

He stared at her silently.

“What is it?" she asked, noticing his intense gaze.

“I think Viola should. resume homeschooling."

Lily was surprised by his sudden decision. “But she just stopped homeschooling recently.”

“I know, but I believe it's best for now."

"Is this because of Ariana?”

“She's trouble.”

“Alexander,what happened before won't happen again. We've made sure of that. She'll always be protected. Besides, Ariana doesn't pose a threat now; she claims to have amnesia, so I'm waiting to see her next move.”

Alexander was prepared to go to any lengths to protect his family. No one would harm them, but he remained vigilant.

As for the contract Lily signed with Ariana for a project, Alexander had reviewed it and realized it was impossible to terminate. All he could do now was double Lily's security and keep a close watch on Ariana to know her plans.

The week passed quietly, and by Friday, Ariana had purchased a new
home in the estate where Lily and Alexander's second house was located.She spent the week gathering information on their activities. She learned that the family of three usually spent weekends at their second house, so she decided to buy a house nearby.


She had initially wanted to purchase a home in the estate where their main mansion was situated, but it was too well-guarded. According to the real estate agent, not just anyone was allowed to buy property there; it was one of Alexander's most secure estates. The estate where she bought her house also belonged to one of Alexander's numerous properties and featured the best home designs.

As she stepped out of the car, her mother followed.

"The house is beautiful, Ariana," her mother admired as they entered."You made a good choice."

"Yes, I did. Do you know why I bought it?”

Mrs. Martins eyed her daughter suspiciously. “Your reasons usually revolve around the Kane family. So, what is it this time?”

Ariana walked ahead and turned to face her mother. "You must have noticed the mansion on the hillside, a little way from us."

"Yes, I saw it. It's stunning and much larger than any house in this estate.



"That house belongs to Alexander Kane. It's their second home," she smiled.

Clara frowned. "I knew it. You always do things because of them. Why not focus on living your life instead of chasing after Alexander?"
“Alexander is my life, Mother. If it weren't impossible to get a house where their main mansion is, I would have moved there instead," she retorted.


Clara sighed.“First, you lied about losing your memory and had me instruct the doctors to create fake medical reports about your amnesia, all for your ridiculous plan to win over Alexander."


“Correction, Mother. I won't be 'winning him over'; I'll make Alexander come to me willingly."

“Good luck with thnat, but be careful not to harm his child." Clara warned,aware of her daughter's capabilities.

Ariana smirked. “It's already the weekend, Mother. Guess what?"

Clara, already tired, braced herself for something outrageous.“What?”

“They always spend weekends at their second home, so today, they'll be coming here.”

"Is that why you made us move in on the same day you bought the house?”


“Of course,why else?”

The house was fully furnished, making it easy to move in immediately.

Clara sighed. “What are you planning, Ariana?"

Ariana smiled. “Be patient, Mother. You'll see." She had everything meticulously planned. She knew Alexander had been keeping an eye on her, which is why she remained discreet. His men,who were monitoring her, had no idea she was in the estate.
She also knew that Alexander always arrived at their weekend mansion before Lily and their child. So, when he arrived. she planned to visit the mansion with her mother to apologize for her past actions. She intended to reveal that it was her mother who had told her about her betrayal and then offer to return what she had taken from Alexander.


This was all part of her strategy to slowly win Alexander back,convinced that he hadn't completely forgotten about her.

She smiled, confident in her plan.
###Chapter 105

Ariana's mother wasn't fully aware of the extent of what her daughter had stolen from Alexander. She had handed over his business strategies and projects to their family's enemy, who promised to help them if she did so.Alexander had placed his trust and love in her, but she betrayed him.giving away all his ideas to his rival. Despite her betrayal. Ariana was secretly pleased that, even 14 years later, Alexander had risen to become the most powerful figure in the business world. It seemed that no obstacle could hinder his success.


As the clock struck 6 pm, Ariana was certain that Alexander had already arrived at his mansion on the hill. After taking a bath, she dressed up in a way that was both alluring and sophisticated. She grabbed her handbag and made her way downstairs to find her mother.

Her mother, noticing Ariana's unusual request, asked with concern,"What are you planning now, Ariana? Your bodyguard told me you wanted us to go out. Where are we headed?"

"Relax, Mother," Ariana responded, settling herself on one of the couches and crossing her legs.

With a sigh, Carolina sat beside her daughter, urging, "Mind explaining?"

Ariana grinned widely. "We're going to the mansion on the hill."

Carolina was taken aback. "Isn't that Alexander's second home?"

"Exactly, Mother. That's why we're going. Alexander always arrives first every Friday evening. He should be there already, and I want us both to pay him a visit."
Carolina's expression hardened. "Ariana, are you out of your mind? All you ever seek is conflict!"


"No, Mother," Ariana assured her, "we're not going to stir up trouble. We're going to ask for Alexander's forgiveness. Fourteen years ago. I betrayed him by stealing his ideas and handing them to his enemy."

"Are you serious about asking for his forgiveness?" Carolina questioned,her voice laced with disbelief. "Aren't you the one who just claimed to have amnesia? If you suddenly beg for his forgiveness, won't it look suspicious?"


Ariana remained calm. "Mother, listen carefully to my plan. Yes, to Alexander. I have amnesia. But he knows that, as my mother, you'd be aware of my past actions. So, it makes sense that, now that you're in the city, you would inform me of the betrayal I don't remember."

"But I still don't know exactly what you took from him," Carolina admitted.


"He assumes you would, since it was something I did to protect our family's company. Given that it was a family matter, it's appropriate for both of us to apologize. I'll continue to act like I don't remember the details, but P'Il show that, after you informed me, I'm willing to seek his forgiveness to make peace," Ariana explained.

Carolina sighed,resigned. "Alright, let's go."


Ariana smiled in satisfaction.

They left the house in one of Ariana's newvly purchased cars. Samson drove them to the mansion on the hill, where they were stopped at the gate by security.
"Who are you, and what's your business here?" one of the guards demanded. The man, who had military training, was under strict orders to keep the mansion private and secure for the family.

"Just inform Alexander Kane that Ariana Martins is here to see him with her mother, Carolina Martins," Ariana instructed.

The guard relayed the message inside to Alexander, who was in the middle of a conference call when he was alerted to their arrival.

Surprised that they had even made it into the estate, Alexander was immediately suspicious. Only residents were allowed entry, so how had they gotten through? He was determined to find out who had allowed them access.


Alexander stepped outside, approaching the gate where Ariana and her mother waited. As they exited the car and neared the gate, Alexander coldly asked, "Why are you here?" He was tempted to deal with Ariana himself, but Lily had urged him to ignore her completely.

Ariana, tears forming in her eyes, responded, "I'm sorry, Mr. Kane. When you pushed me at the banquet, I was confused and hurt by your actions.But two days ago, my mother arrived and told me everything I had done to you 14 years ago. I can hardly believe I was capable of such betrayal."

"Please forgive me," she pleaded. "Though I don't deserve it, I knew I had to apologize. You loved and cared for me, and I betrayed you. I've returned to start anew, and all I want is to make peace with everyone I've wronged. I hope we can be friends if you'll allow it." Ariana wiped away her tears.

Her mother chimed in,"′′M. Kane, please forgive my daughter. She only did what she did out of desperation to help our family. I only learnedof it
shortly before her accident. She spent 12 years in a coma, and all I wvish for her now is a peaceful life. Please, find it in your heart to forgive her."

Alexander silently studied the two women. He was on the verge of ordering them to be thrown off the estate when he noticed Lily's car approaching. Deciding to let her handle the situation, he chose not to intervene.


Ariana turned to see who was arriving and was startled to recognize Lily's car. According to her informant. Lily usually arrived at 8 pm with her daughter, but today she was early. Ariana decided to remain calm, hoping Alexander would invite them inside so she could find an opportunity to speak with him privately and perhaps rekindle the feelings they once shared before she ruined everything.


"Mummy, who are those people?" Viola asked as she saw the two women.

Lily, trying to keep her composure, was surprised to see Ariana and her mother. She reassured her daughter, "They're just some random people."and Viola nodded, accepting the explanation.

Holding her daughter's hand, Lily walked toward the gate. Viola's face lit up when she saw her father, exclaiming, "Daddy!"

Alexander's stern expression softened as he saw his beloved daughter and wife. The guards opened the gate, allowing them inside the compound.Viola ran to hug her father, who kissed her forehead. Lily wrapped her arms around Alexander, andI they kissed in front of everyone, including Ariana,whose heart sank at the sight.

The display of affection reminded Ariana of the times Alexander would kiss her in front of everyone at the university, flaunting their relationship.She had once been the envy of all the girls because of his love for her.
Ariana had believed that, despite her betrayal, Alexander might still forgive her, but she had forgotten that he despised betrayal more than anything. It pained her to see him give that love to someone else. As Alexander and Lily continued their passionate kiss, Ariana fumed silently but maintained her composure.


Lily, sensing the tension, had kissed Alexander so publicly to assert her place. She clearly didn't believe Ariana's story about losing her memory.Viola's innocent smile as her parents expressed their love only added to Ariana's irritation. She despised both the little girl and her mother and was determined to ensure that Lily wouldn't have another child with Alexander.


After the kiss, Lily wiped the lipstick stain from Alexander's lips, a gesture that disgusted Ariana. Lily then turned to the women with a stern look."How did you manage to get into this estate?" she demanded.

"Because I own a house here," Ariana responded confidently.

Alexander's anger flared. "You what?"

"I own a house here," she repeated.

"How did you get a house on my estate?" Alexander was livid at the thought. How could this have happened without his knowledge? He vowed to find out who had leaked the information.

Lily shot Ariana a sharp look. The woman was testing her patience."You dare buy a house on my estate and then come here to see my husband,claiming to have amnesia?"
###Chapter 106

“You had the audacity to purchase a property in my estate and then show up here to see my husband, all while claiming you suffer from amnesia?"

"Your estate?" Ariana asked, genuinely surprised.

"Yes, my estate." Lily responded sharply. "Apparently, you missed the part in the contract where it clearly states that this estate belongs to me, Lily Kane."


Ariana was stunned: She had never imagined that Alexander would list Lily as the owner of the entire estate. The realization hit her hard, stirring emotions she struggled to keep under control.

Attempting to regain her composure, Carolna interjected, "I apologize for intruding, Mr. and Mrs. Kane. My daughter and I will leave now. We've done what we came here to do-offer our apologies for the mistakes she made in the past. She's just trying to start anew, and part of that is seeking forgiveness from those she wronged. It's late; we should be going.Ariana." She took Ariana by the arm, and they walked back to their car.Samson turned the vehicle around and drove them awvay from the estate.

Lily remained standing until the car was out of sight, her mind racing.

Alexander, filled with anger, quickly dialed James's number. "How in the world did Ariana manage to buy a house in the Hills estate?"

"What?" James's eyes widened in shock.

"Find out how she was able to secure that property from the real estate agency and report back to me immediately," Alexander ordered before abruptly hanging up.
"Don't worry; I'll make sure she leaves this estate," he said resolutely.

Lily sighed, attempting to calm the situation. "She's already bought the house. Let's just let it go."

"No." Alexander replied firmly, leaving no room for argument.

"Alexander, I'll handle this..."

"No." Alexander interrupted. "I don't want you involved with her at all."

Lily sighed. "Well. I already have a project to manage with her, so I'll be seeing her at work starting next week. Besides, this isn't our main residence-we can just stop coming here on weekends and visit our other properties. We have more than one estate. I'm suggesting this because of what happened online last time. She's obviously very dramatic,and if we try to cancel her ownership and refund her payment, she might go public with it, causing us more trouble than we need."

Alexander considered her words and eventually nodded. "You're right.my love. But after your business dealings with her are over, I don't want you having anything more to do with her. I don't care if she really lost her memory or not. As far as I'm concerned, she's dead to me."

When Samson pulled into their driveway, Ariana stormed out of the car and headed straight into the mansion without waiting for her mother.It wasn't long before Carolina and Samson heard the sound of objects being smashed inside. Rushing in, they found Ariana destroying the newly purchased, expensive items in the living room and dining area.

"Ariana, stop!" Carolina screamed, but Ariana continued to break everything in sight-vases, paintings,anything within reach.

"Enough, Ariana, you're losing your mind!" Carolina shouted again,while
Samson stood frozen, shocked by the destruction she was causing. He had seen his boss overreact before, but never to this extent.

Once there was nothing left to destroy, Ariana turned to her mother,tears streaming down her face. "He bought her this entire estate, Mother. He did that for her." Her voice was filled with anguish. "Do you know why I'm losing it? Because he promised to buy me an estate and put it in my name.Me!" She pointed at herself, overwhelmed with emotion. "But instead, he did it for her! I wish I had never betrayed him. That way, I would have been the one by his side, the one he loves, the one with his child!" Her tears fell uncontrollably.


"Oh, my child," Carolina said softly, walking over to embrace her. "I'm here for you, okay? You don't have to cry anymore.Stop crying,my girl;you'll be fine."


Ariana sniffled, resting her head on her mother's shoulder. "Thank you,Mother, for being here. I don't know what I'd do without you," she said.her voice trembling with sorrow.


Does this mean she's going to fall apart when she dliscovers all that Alexander has done for Lily?


The Following Week...

Ariana began her work week by visiting her family's company branch in Aurora City before heading to the Blake Group headquarters. She had read countless business magazines and interviews detailing all of Lily's accomplishments since she took over as CEO of Blake Corporation.Everything about Lily seemed flawless-her success,her perfect husband and it infuriated Ariana. But she reassured herself that, slowly but surely,she would take everything away from Lily.
Steeling herself, Ariana entered the massive building. She took the elevator to the 49th floor, where Lily's office was located.

Inside. Lily was with Sarah when Katrina informed her that Ariana had arrived with her assistant,Emily.

Lily and Sarah exchanged knowing glances.

"You're really going to do business with her? Seriously? You're going to work with your husband's ex, the one who betrayed him?" Sarah asked,clearly upset.

Lily sighed. "You're in law enforcement, Sarah, so you know that a contract like this can't just be terminated. The last thing I want is to give her any share of this company, even if it's just 1%."

"Damn it," Sarah muttered. "I'm sure she planned this from the start. She probably approved the deal just to get close to Alexander. You need to be careful with her, Lily. I'm almost certain she hasn't lost her memory like she claims."


Lily listened to her friend's concerns and nodded, seemingly unbothered."After my contract with her is finished, I'll have no further dealings with her."


"Ma'am, she's here," Katrina announced.

Sarah sighed, giving Lily a tight hug. "Please be careful. Lily. I'm going to miss you."

"I'll miss you too, and my godchild," Lily replied with a smile.

Sarah was heading back to Country C with Anthony, where they had made their home.
"Goodbye."

After saying their farewells. Sarah left the office. On her way out, she encountered Ariana walking toward the office.

Ariana shot her an indifferent look, about to walk past, but Sarah stepped in front of her, blocking her path.

"Excuse me, do you need something?" Ariana asked, irritated that she was being stopped.

"Yes, I do. I want you to stay away from Lily, Alexander, and their child.Any business you have with her should remain strictly professional and nothing more."

"And who are you to tell me this?" Ariana replied, pretending not to know who Sarah was.


"I'm her best friend, Sarah Mascots, wife of Anthony Mascots. I'm sure you know who he is."

Ariana already knew that Anthony, a bilionaire, had married Lily's friend.But she maintained her facade. "That doesn't put you in a position to make decisions for them," she retorted.

Sarah stepped closer, causing Aríana to take a slight step back. Sarah smirked. "I know you didn't lose your memory as you claim and that you've planned this all along. You'd better not try anything shady, or you'll regret it," she warned.

Ariana smiled, unfazed. "Can I go now?"

"Not quite. One last thing."
"What is it?"

"Your fist name starts with an A, right? Well, the last woman who tried to go against Lily also had a name starting with the letter A. Care to guess where sheis now?"

Ariana gave her a dismissive look. "I have no idea what you're implying."

"Since you won't guess, I'll tell you," Sarah said, leaning in closer until she could whisper in Ariana's ear. "She's six feet under as we speak. That's what happens to anyone who crosses Lily. So, whatever battle you think you're about to start, you'd better reconsider because Lily will make you wish you never woke up from that coma." Sarah then stepped back to observe Ariana's reaction, catching a glimpse of anger before it quickly disappeared.

Sarah smiled again. "I must admit, you're good at hiding your emotions.But don't worry; soon enough, you won't be able to hide them anymore."
###Chapter 107

Sarah smiled in satisfaction after delivering her piece, then walked away.leaving an enraged Ariana standing there. Ariana clenched herfists tightly.trying to suppress her anger-this wasn't the time or place to lose control.

"Hello, Lily, how are you?" Ariana greeted as she approached. Lily looked up from her paperwork and met Ariana's gaze. Dressed in a sharp.professional outfit similar to how she'd appeared when they first met in Europe, Ariana exuded the same intelligence and business acumen. But now that Lily knew the truth about who Ariana was, she couldn't help but see her as the woman Alexander once cared for before she betrayed him.

The thought of Alexander's past affection for Ariana made Lily feel a deep unease. If it were up to her, she would have dissolved their business contract to avoidI further contact. Lily sensed Ariana's presence brought nothing good. She had overheard the conversation between Ariana and Sarah outside her office, and though Sarah's words could easily have provoked anger, Ariana had remained calmn. Now, she stood there.smiling-a smile that was clearly a facade.

Lily returned a small, polite smile. "Welcome to Blake Group headquarters,Ms. Martins. Please have a seat, and we can begin."

"Thank you, Mrs. Kane," Ariana replied, taking a seat opposite Lily. Lily nodded and handed her some files. "These are for the project. We'll have a meeting with the department handling it in a few minutes."

"Alright," Ariana said as she took the files and began reviewing them. The office fell silent as both women focused on their work. A few minutes later.Ariana spoke up. "I'm done."

Lily glanced up, slightly surprised."You've finished reviewing them
already?"

"Yes, it's straightforward. We're planning to build the largest shopping complex in the newly developing suburban district," Ariana said with a confident smile.


Lily nodded, still scanning through her own files. "We have a few minutes before the meeting. I'll just go over these once more, and then we can head in."


"Okay," Ariana agreed, watching Lily asshe worked. Seeing Lily's focus,Ariana understood why she had achieved so much in just a few years as the CEO of her grandfather's company. It made sense why Alexander admired her; she was the heir and had accomplished everything on her own,without his help.


Ariana silently vowed to bring Lily down, to make her lose her status as the most successful businesswoman in the city, and then, perhaps.Alexander would turn his attention back to her. As she surveyed the office,the familiar design caught her eye.

Lily's office was decorated in a soothing gray palette, with expensive paintings adorning the walls and a plush couch inviting guests to relax.The large window offered a stunning view of the city, filling the room with natural light and creating a tranquil atmosphere.

"Your office is beautiful, Lily," Ariana complimented.

"Thank you," Lily responded without looking up.

"The design reminds me of someone," Ariana added, a smile playing on her lips as she thought of Alexander, who loved such designs,especially offices with a city view.
Lily looked up at her, aware of who Ariana was referring to. Did she still remember Alexander?


"Oh really? My husband designed this office specifically for me," Lily said with a content smile.


Ariana's smile faltered; she hadn't expected that. She almost let her guard slip. "Really?"

"Yes. So, who did it remind you of?" Lily asked, looking Ariana directly in the eye,waiting to catch any lie she might tell.

Ariana ran a hand through her hair with a practiced grace. "There was someone who kept me company while I was recovering after waking from a coma. He loved the color gray and always talked about how much he admired an office with a view of the city, just like this one. I miss him dearly and wish he were with me now," Ariana said, her words clearly referring to Alexander, though she pretended it was someone else.

Lily knew she was lying but chose to stay silent, knowing that Ariana would eventually reveal her true intentions. They both left the office and headed to the meeting.

Lily introduced Aríana to the project team. "Mrs. Kane, would it be alright if I added three members from my company to the project team?" Ariana asked.

Lily was unsure of Ariana's motives but couldn't refuse since Ariana was part of the project. "Of course," she replied.

"Thanks," Ariana said, satisfied. The meeting commenced with the team leader presenting the full project details. At one point, Ariana grew confused and interrupted, "Excuse me, could you hold on a second?"
"Is therean issue, Ms. Martins?" Lily inquired.

"Why wasn't I informed about this?" Ariana asked, pointing to a part of the project being discussed.

Lily looked at the section Ariana indicated. The shopping complex was set to be built in a district undergoing development. The government's plan was for this district to become one of the top areas in the state, and this complex was expected to be a major attraction. However, Ariana hadn't noticed the location change. The government had recently revised the district's development plan, allocating a new location for all commercial projects, including theirs. Residential and commercial areas were now to be segregated.

"I want to know why I wasn't informed about the location change," Ariana demanded.

"The government revised the district's development plan. They want residential buildings in one area and commercial ones in another," Lily explained.

"Then why didn't you tell me?" Ariana asked, visibly irritated.

"I gave you the project file to review when we were alone in the office.You read through it so quickly that I wondered if you had noted all the details," Lily replied calmly.

"You should have mentioned it dírectly!" Ariana snapped, unable to contain her anger any longer.

Her outburst shocked everyone in the room, including several company directors present to sign off on the project plan. Lily smiled at Ariana's sudden loss of composure. If something this minor could provoke her.
what would happen with a more significant issue? It was becoming increasingly clear that Ariana harbored deep-seated anger and resentment toward her, something Lily had noticed the day Ariana visited their home with her mother.


Ariana would eventually expose herself, and Lily couldn't wait for that moment, as it would give her a valid reason to deal with her.

Lily leaned back in her chair with the authority of a trueleader."Ms.Martins, you overlooked the part that stated when the government made changes to the plan. You should have read the file carefully. As a businesswoman, why aren't you staying updated on business and governmental news, especially regarding this district project?"

Everyone in the room turned to Ariana, waiting for her response. She could feel their eyes on her, and the weight of their scrutiny made her realize she should have kept herself informed about the country's current affairs. Now, she had embarrassed herself in front of everyone.


It wasn't Lily's responsibility to inform her of something that was already public knowledge.

"You were in the media spotlight just a few days ago, Ms. Martins.You should be aware of how the media operates: all news, including business updates, is reported. You should prioritize staying informed on important matters," Lily stated firmly.

Ariana was left speechless, having lost her temper over something she should have already known. She had no defense.

"I expect this project to be a success, as it will be the first and last collaboration between Blake Group and Martins Corporation," Lily declared in front of everyone.
Ariana's anger boiled within her. Lily had dared to humiliate her publicly.
and she would make her pay for it. She clenched her fists tightly,vowing
revenge.
###Chapter 108

After the meeting concluded, Ariana stormed out of the company,seething with anger and returned home in a fury.

"Welcome home, my dear. How was the meeting?" Carolina inquired,but upon seeing the furious expression on her daughter's face, she immediately realized that things hadn't gone well.

"What's wrong, sweetheart? Did something happen?”

Ariana tossed her handbag onto the couch with force. "It's that insufferable woman!"


"What woman are you talking about?"

Ariana glared at her mother. "You know exactly who I'm talking about-the woman who's a constant thorn in my side."

“Oh,you mean Lily?” Carolina sat down on one of the couches and crossed her legs.

"Yes, it's her! Stop pretending you don't know who I mean! That woman went too far today!" she raged.

"What did she do? Or rather, what did you say to her? Because I know you very well."

Ariana clenched her fists and gritted her teeth. "You're already taking her side before knowing what happened!"

Carolina sighed in exasperation. "You just got home, and you're already wearing me out. Just tell me what happened, Ariana."
Ariana recounted the events to her mother.

"Is that all?" Carolina asked.

"What do you mean by 'Is that all?'”

"From what you told me, it seems like you failed to stay updated with recent developments. She even gave you the file to review before the meeting started, but you didn't go through it, so that's on you.”

“Really?!" Ariana exclaimed.

"Yes, my dear," Carolina said honestly. “But as for her publicly declaring that she won't work with our company after this project, that was pretty bold. She could have told you privately, but since you two aren't friends or even close,that's likely why she said it."

Ariana tried to calm herself. “By the time I'm done with her, she'll regret daring to cross me and stealing the man I love!"

Carolina sighed wearily. "She didn't steal Alexander from you, Ariana."

“She did!"

Carolina found it hard to comprehend how the conversation had suddenly shifted to another topic. "For crying out loud, Ariana, the whole world thought you were dead. Besides, you betrayed Alexander, so whatever you had between you two ended even before your accident."

"Stop it, Mother!" Ariana shouted, loathing the truth she didn't want to accept."May I remind you, Mother, that if it weren't for what I did, our family's company wouldn't exist today? I did what I had to do for our family, and because of that, I lost Alexander. If I don't get him back.everyone will pay the price for my pain, including you, Mother!" Ariana
declared before storming upstairs to her room.

Tears welled up in Carolina's eyes at her daughter's words. The truth was that she and her husband had resigned themselves to the fate of their family's company, but 19-year-old Ariana refused to let their family name fall into ruin or allow them to become poor and be ridiculed. She went to Alexander for help, but he, being young and without an established company, couldn't do much. Out of desperation, she stole Alexander's business plan and sought help to save their family.

Carolina would have stopped her daughter, but she didn't, and perhaps she was to blame as well. She felt terrified of what her daughter might do or plan to do.

The following day, Ariana asked her new assistant, Emily, to update her on all the news that might interest her.

"I also want you to send some people to keep an eye on Lily and the other projects she's handling in the company. I want every detail about those projects.”

“Is there a specific reason you want this, ma'am?” Emily asked, but the icy glare from Ariana made her swallow in fear. Sometimes, her boss could be terrifying.

“You dare to ask such a foolish question?"

“Please forgive me, ma'am.”

Ariana stared at her coldly.′′Pay some insiders working under Lily. I want them to help me monitor her and report everything she does."

"I'll get on it right away, ma'am. Is there anything else you need?"
“Yes, I also want you to place someone among Alexander Kane's top employees. I want daily reports on his every activity."

“Ma'am, it will be difficult to get an insider since Mr. Kane constantly evaluates his close employees and keeps a tight watch on them."

“Do whatever it takes. I want results, not excuses!" Ariana shouted.

Emily stepped back in fear. “I'm sorry, ma'am. I'll do everything I can to make it happen." She bowed her head as she spoke.

Ariana smiled. “Good,you're dismissed.”

Emily left the office as quickly as possible. Ariana sat down in her executive chair, opened a folder on her computer, and stared at the image on the screen with anger. It was a picture of Alexander and Lily enjoying a romantic dinner at an upscale restaurant reserved for the wealthy.The way Alexander held her in the image and kissed her filled Ariana with so much rage that she shoved her PC off the table, sending it crashing to the floor with a loud thud.


This photo had been sent to her that morning by the people she hadhired to keep an eye on them. Just looking at the photo made her seethe with jealousy and fury.

"Enjoy your last dinner with him, because soon you'll experience hell,"Ariana murmured. She was determined to get Alexander back, no matter what.



***********

Two weeks later, Lily and Alexander were abruptly awakened by the loud ringing of their phones. They both got up, surprised that their phones were ringing at the same time, and even someone was knocking on their
room door.

They exchanged glances.

"Why don't you answer yours? It might be more important. I'll go see who's at the door," Lily suggested.

Alexander nodded.

Lily got up and went to open the door while Alexander answered his call.When Lily opened the door, she saw that it was Clara.


“Sorry to disturb you, ma'am, but there's a serious problem," Clara said,panic evident in her voice.

"What's wrong, Clara?” Lily noticed how distressed she looked and became alarmed. "Is Viola okay?" She was about to rush to Viola's room when Clara stopped her.

"Viola is fine. The problem is about you, ma'am.”

“Me?How?”

Clara tried to steady her nerves, but the situation was too overwhelming for her to remain calm. “Ma'am, as I speak, reporters and the police are outside,waiting to come in and arrest you,"

Lily raised an eyebrow. "Arrest me?” She found it hard to believe, but with the way Clara was acting, it seemed true.

Lily remembered the relentless phone calls she and Alexander had received that woke them up.

“Wait here.”
She went back into the room and saw that Alexander was still on the phone. When he saw her come in, he ended the call and walked toward her.


“Are you okay?" He placed his hand on her face.


“Yes, I'm fine, but Clara just told me something about the police and reporters outside the house."


By the look on Alexander's face, she knew he was already aware of it.

“Yes, I know. James just informed me about everything that's happening.Don't worry, I won't let anything happen to you. Whoever is involved in this will pay."

"Involved in what?” Lily was still confused, completely clueless about what had transpired overnight. She was unaware that the entire internet was ablaze with news.


Her question made Alexander realize that she had no idea what was going on.


Alexander sighed.“All the orphanages and foundations under your family's company were demolished with people inside. A large number of kids and staff are dead.”

"Oh my God!" Lily screamed, covering her mouth in shock. She couldn't believe what she was hearing. Her hands started trembling, and Alexander had to hold them. “Who could have done this? How... how?" Tears streamed down her face.

“It's okay, I'll findI out who's behind this and also who has framed you as the culprit," Alexander assured her.
His words made her step back and look at him. “What do you mean.Alexander? I don't understand. Why are the police here?”

"Some documents containing your signature indicate that you approved the demolition of the orphanages and foundation houses a week ago and instructed the demolition to take place at night. The police are here to arrest you as the responsible party for what happened."


Lily was dumbfounded.“What documents? I never signed any documents or gave such instructions." She shook her head. utterly confused. What was happening?
###Chapter 109

Lily was utterly dlevastated as she watched the surveillance footage of the orphanage building.Her gaze was locked on the screen, taking in the heartbreaking sight of the structure being demolished with people still inside.


“Oh no, this can't be happening!" she cried out in horror, tears streaming down her face.


Alexander gently took the tablet from her trembling hands and pulled her into his embrace. "It's going to be alright," he tried to soothe her.

"It's not alright!" she yelled, a rare outburst of anger fueled by the sheer shock of what she had just seen.


Alexander understood the depth of her anguish. No one could witness such a tragedy and remain unaffected.

"I'm sorry," he whispered, holdig her tightly and gently rubbing her back.

"I never authorized the destruction of those buildings," Lily insisted,her voice quivering.

"I know, and I'm going to find out who did this," Alexander vowed.determined to uncover the truth.

Lily pulled away from his arms, staring at her shaking hands.overwhelmed by the knowledge that innocent lives had been lost because of the demolition.

Clara, who had been standing nearby, shared in Lily's distress. She knew her employer was a kind woman who would never approve of such a heinous act. It was evident that someone had tried to ruin her reputation.
Lily would never. under any circumstances. agree to something so monstrous. How could she have possibly authorized the destruction of orphanages and foundations dedicated to caring for children, staff. and the disabled?


Her family had established numerous charitable foundations for those in need; why would she want to destroy them? It made no sense.


As Alexander observed Lily lost in thought, it was as if she had mentally retreated to a distant place. He gently lifted her chin to meet her eyes."I know you're innocent in this. Someone must have forged your signature.and I'm determined to find out who. No one close to you,not even your assistant or bodyguards, can be trusted." he asserted.

Lily responded with a stiff nod,signaling her agreement.

She began heading towards the bathroom, but Alexander stopped her."Where are you going?" he asked, concerned. He knew she wasn't in her right state of mind after witnessing the tragedy.

"I just need to take a bath. Since the police are already here, I'll get ready and go with them to the station."

"No,you don't need to do that. You're not going to the station. They're here to arrest you, and you expect me to stand by and let that happen?"

“Reporters are with them. If I don't go, it will cause a scandal. People will think we're trying to cover up what happened. They already believe I'm guilty since my signature is on that document, so this could create even more problems. Just let me get ready and go with them."

“No.”

“Alexander,I have to-”
"I said no. I won't allow it. I'll call the police chief and have him order the officers to leave without you. We'Il visit the station later today after investigating what happened."

Lily sighed in exhaustion, unsure of what to say.

“Don't worry, we'll uncover the person who forged the documents,"Alexander assured her.

Lily nodded.

An hour later, the police left the premises, along with the reporters.However, the reporters made sure to inform the public through a live broadcast that Mrs. Kane had refused to go with the police despite what she had done. The entire internet exploded with negative comments,criticizing the Kanes for what had happened.

The demolition had provided her detractors with yet another opportunity to tarnish the image of both the Kanes and the Blakes.

"What else can you expect from a wicked woman whose grandfather was equally wicked? They're a perfect match!" one commenter wrote.

"I heard she killed her stepsister and framed her stepmother, sending her to prison. If she could do that to her own family, it's no surprise she'd do the same to innocent people they claimed to care about!”another commenter added.

“How could she authorize the demolition of buildings with people still inside? The blood of those people is on her hands. She's definitely going to pay for this, and I hope she rots in jail!" an angry critic posted.

The internet buzzed with comments from all sides, and the Blake company's stocks plummeted for the second time in two months.
Lily paced back and forth as her phone continued to ring incessantly,but she refused to answer any of the calls. When she saw that Jacob was calling, she finally picked up.

“Hello,Jacob."

"Lily, are you okay? I saw the photos and videos online and heard about the accusations against you."


"Yes.”Lily sighed.

“Should I erase the information online?"

“It's better not to."

“But things are already really bad.”

"It will only get worse if you try to erase the noise from the internet. Plus,removing it won't stop people from seeking justice for those who died.
The families of the victims will demand justice,and erasing the content won't stop the investigation or prevent me from going to prison if my innocence isn't proven in court.”

Jacob sighed.“Okay,I understand."

“Good,but there is something I need you to do for me discreetly."

Jacob perked up. "Tell me what I can do to help!" Hle was eager to get involved.

Lily glanced around to make sure Alexander wasn't nearby before telling Jacob what she needed him to do in secret.
###Chapter 110

The following day, after bidding farewell to Viola, who remained unaware of the situation, Lily and Alexander headed to the central police station for questioning. Outside the station, they encountered families of the disabled and friends of some orphans, aIl protesting and demanding her arrest.They held signs with Lily's name and messages like "Arrest Lily Kane."

Though Lily remained composed, Alexander stayed close by her side as they exited the car. Approximately 20 bodyguards surrounded them,shielding them from the angry crowd as they entered the police statión.Protesters hurled eggs and tomatoes at her, but the bodyguards used umbrellas to block the projectiles. Alexander protected his beloved wife until they were safely inside the police commissioner's office.

They sat down on the office couch while the guards secured the door.Alexander scanned the room and noticed a camera. The commissioner hadn't arrived yet, but he was sure they were being monitored.

"I hate that we had to come here," Alexander muttered.

"It would've only made things worse if I hadn't come. You saw the crowd outside-if I didn't show up today, it would've grown until the entire city was in chaos because of me."

"I don't care," Alexander replied, gripping her hand firmly.

Lily sighed. "Children died, Alexander. Staff and disabled individuals lost their lives. They believe I approved the demolition of those buildings,so it's understandable they want me behind bars."

"You didn't do it, and I won't let you go to jail. You were sued yesterday;what's the point of coming here when the case will be handled in court?
People who oppose our family are seizing this opportunity to bring us down."


"By the time the court hearing starts, we'll have all the evidence," Lily assured him.


"Yes, we will," Alexander said, meeting her gaze."Every staff member who works closely with you is being questioned right now."

Lily nodded.

After some time, the commissioner and other police officials arrived.Alexander remained seated next to Lily, not bothering to stand. Lily wanted to get up and greet them, but Alexander wouldn't let her.

"Alexander," she scolded.

"They're public servants; they should be the ones to greet us," he said.

Lily sighedin frustration, surprised at how petty Alexander could be.The commissioner and officers greeted them, and Lily responded with a nod while remaining seated, since Alexander insisted she not stand. Alexander,however,completely ignored their greetings.

Typically, someone in her position would be interrogated in a questioning room, but given her status as the granddaughter of Caleb Blake and wife of Alexander Kane, they dared not move her there. The detective accompanying the commissioner presented the evidence, claiming she had authorized the demolition and ordered it to be carried out in the middle of the night.

“There's no such document," Lily insisted. "My family founded these orphanages and foundations, which have existed for 20 years. There has never been a directive to demolish those buildings.”
"Take a look for yourself. This document was created a week before the demolition, and you signed it the day before," the inspector continued,showing them the file.

Lily and Alexander examined the document while the inspector explained."The prosecutor's office obtained permission to search the Blake headquarters, where they found this document among your company files,along with papers related to the orphanages and foundations. Around 70documents were confiscated."


"We're aware of this," Alexander said coldly. "Tell us what happens next."

The detective exchanged glances with the commissioner and the other officers, who nodded for him to proceed.

"We're sorry to inform you, but Mrs. Kane will need to be arrested and held in jail throughout the trial, as all the documents indicate her guilt,"the detective said,his voice trembling.

A heavy silence fell over the room. Everyone feared Alexander's reaction,hoping there might be another way, but the evidence against Lily was damning.

"Where's the arrest warrant?" Alexander finally asked, breaking the tension.

The detective handed them the warrant, stamped by higher authorities.After reviewing it, they realized that the only way Lily could avoid jail was if they presented evidence proving she hadn't signed the document.

Lily looked at Alexander, seeing the fury in his eyes. She knew him well-he wouldn't allow her to spend even a night in jail.

“Alexander," she finally called his name, noticing he wasn't saying anything.
He turnedto her.“What?”

"You should leave. I'll stay."

Her words only fueled his anger. "And tell Viola what,exactly? That her mother is in jail?” Lily bit her lip, having momentarily forgotten about Viola.


Alexander was right. What would they tell her? She'd be expecting both parents to return home by evening, but only one would come back.

"You could say I'm on a business trip," Lily suggested.

"For how long? The court hearing isn't for another three weeks."

“I won't be there that long. Remember, we're already investigating and gathering proof that the signature was forged."

Alexander shook his head. "No, you're coming home to me and Viola today. I don't care how long it takes, but we're staying here until our people bring evidence and my lawyers arrive."

Lily sighed, unsure how to persuade him otherwise. The people in the office exchanged uneasy glances.

"If we don't have evidence by the end of today, I'm afraid she'll be transferred to a women's prison," the detective said.

News spread quickly about Lily Kane's arrest and Alexander Kane's refusal to leave the police station without her. Caleb Blake,along with other family members and friends, came to visit them at the station.Meanwhile, Viola, still unaware of the situation, was at home,receiving lessons and expecting her parents to return soon.
Clara watched the little girl play in her designated play area within the estate, a sad smile on her face. À large security detail kept a close watch on her as she played with her toys and pet animals.

Ariana, in contrast, had been in high spirits since the demolition and felt elated when she heard about Lily's arrest. But her mood soured when she learned that Alexander had chosen to stay with Lily at the police station.She couldn't believe that, despite the overwhelming evidence, he still trusted her.


"Let's see how long that trust lasts," Ariana muttered through gritted teeth.

Evening arrived, but there was still no evidence to prove Lily's innocence or that the document had been falsified1. For the first time in his life.Alexander felt utterly defeated. As a powerful figure with extensive influence, he was accustomed to having everything at his fingertips. He had spent years navigating the legal system, breaking people out of jail.and placing others behind bars. But now, with the person he loved most on the line, all his power seemed useless.

None of his contacts could uncover proof that the document had been forged.

"There's still time," Lily said.

Alexander paced angrily around the commissioner's office. He concluded that whoever orchestrated this must be extremely clever, using a tactic he hadn't yet discovered, as even their expert hackers couldIn't find anything.

Lily walked over to him, gently making him stop and turn to face her.

"Alexander, I'll get out of this, but you have to trust me. If there's no evidence by tomorrow, then I'll go to jail."
"No. no." Alexander shook his head, refusing to accept it.

Lily placed her hands on his face, forcing him to look her in the eye. "Yes.Alexander, I'll have to goto jail. But it's okay because, after the court case.I'll be proven innocent and victorious."
###Chapter 111

The next day, after finalizing the arrangements, Lily was scheduled to be transferred to the women's prison. Ariana, feeling triumphant, was elated upon hearing that Lily would be held in the women's cell until the trial concluded. Eager not to miss the sight of Lily being taken to jail, Ariana disguised herself and made her way to the police station.

Seated in the back of a taxi with a scarf wrapped around her, Ariana parked across from the police station. From the taxi, she watched as Lily,handcuffed, was escorted to the prison transport vehicle. A smile of satisfaction spread across Ariana's face-this was just the beginning. She intended to ensure that Lily remained incarcerated even after the trial.Everything had been meticulously planned, and she was confident there would be no evidence to clear Lily's name.

Now that Lily was out of the picture, Ariana felt a sense of ease.She anticipated that Alexander, in his vulnerable state, could be easily manipulated to her advantage. As she observed the scene, she noticed Alexander standing a short distance away, watching as Lily was placed in the vehicle. With him were Lily's grandfather,father, and a few other family members. Ariana expected to see a worried expression on Alexander's face, similar to the rest of the family, but instead,his face was devoid of emotion. She couldn't decipher what he was feeling as he witnessed Lily being taken to prison.

Ariana wondered if he was beginning to lose faith in Lily. If that were true.it would bring her immense satisfaction. "Get me out of here," she instructed the taxi driver, who immediately drove away.

Lily's imprisonment had quelled the protests from citizens and the families of those who had lost their lives. Despite her being in jail,
Alexander ensuared that she was provided with every possible luxury within her cell. When Lily was escorted inside the prison,wearing her prison uniform, she expected to be treated like any other inmate. However,she was surprised when she was placed in a lavish cell.

From the outside, the door appeared to lead to an ordinary cell,but inside was a different story. It was more like a small luxury apartment, complete with a large bed, TV, kitchen, and a spotless bathroom. Lily sighed,knowing this was Alexander's doing. He had allowed her to go to prison as she had wanted, but he made sure she wouldn't lack any comfort.There was even a freezer stocked with food.


After the guards locked the cell from the outside, Lily sat down on the couch and began to contemplate her plan. Ariana thought she had won.but Lily was determined to show her what would happen when this was all over. She was certain that only one person could have orchestrated this,and that person was Ariana. The woman hadn't lost her memory; she wanted Lily out of the way and was willing to go to any lengths to achieve that. all so she could rekindle her relationship with Alexander. But what Ariana didn't realize was that Lily was prepared for her.

With Lily now in prison, the protests had ceased. All that remained was to await the first court hearing. That evening, Alexander returned home,standing outside the door, pondering how he would explain Lily's absence to their daughter, Viola. Neither of them had returned home the previous day, and now he was coming home without Lily. Though Lily's plan was well thought out, he wished there had been another way to handle things without her going to jail.

The thought of Lily being imprisoned made him clench his fists in frustration. While he had ensured she had all the comforts she needed in prison, he still felt like he had failed her.
"Welcome home, Mr. Kane," Clara greeted him with a bow.

Alexander nodded. “Where's Viola?”

“She's in the living room. She refused to go to bed and has been waiting for both of you."

"Did you tell her anything?"

“No,sir, I wouldn't dare."

“I'll go explain things to her. You can retire for the night."

Clara nodded and left as Alexander entered the living room. There, he found his little daughter staring up at the ceiling with wide eyes. He glanced up at the ceiling, wondering what she was looking at.

"Is there something up there?" he asked.

“Daddy!”Víola sprang up from the couch and rushed to her father,hugging his legs tightly. At five years old, she was already taller than most children her age, but she still loved hugging her father's legs.

Alexander lifted her into his arms and hugged her tightly. “How was your day?”

Viola pouted as if she was about to cry. "It was boring. You and Mommy left me all alone."

Alexander's heart ached at her words. "I'm so sorry. Can you forgive me?"


“No.”

“But why don't you want to forgive Daddy?" he asked, pretending to be sad.
“Because I want you and Mommy to apologize together sinceyou both left me alone."

The life drained from his face. Viola noticed her father's expression and frowned.“Where's Mommy?”


Alexander and the rest of the family had thought carefully about what to tell her.


"I'm sorry,sweetheart,but Mommy had to visit a distant cousin she hasn't seen in years. The cousin is very sick and in the hospital, needing surgery. It will take weeks for her cousin to recover, so Mommy has to stay until she gets better."

Viola blinked her long, natural lashes as she listened to her father. “I didn't know Mommy had a distant cousin.”

“Yes, she does, my love, but she hadn't had a chance to tell you about her."

Viola stared at her father with a serious look. Despite being only five,her intelligence was impressive, and she wasn't easily fooled.

“Daddy?”

"Yes. my love," Alexander replied, aware that she wasn'tfully convinced.

"Why didn't Mommy bring her cousin to our city?”

“Because her cousin is too sick to travel."

Viola thought about this for a moment before nodding. "Okay, but I need to talk to Mommy. I want her to explain why she didn't tell me she was leaving."She was ready to give her mother a piece of her mind.

Alexander considered his next move. "I'll let you talk to her tomorrow,but
for now,you need to go to bed, Viola."

Viola pouted again. "But I miss Mommy."

"I know, my love, but you need to sleep. It's already late, and it's midnight where your mom is.”

Reluctantly, Viola nodded, though her beautiful blue eyes welled up with tears. Alexander felt a sharp pain in his heart-first because his wife was in jail, and second because his daughter was crying in his arms. Seeing the two people he cared about most in the world so upset made him feel even worse.

After making sure Viola was asleep, he went to the bedroom he shared with Lily. As soon as he walked in, he regretted it. All the memories they had shared in that room came flooding back.

He lay down on Lily's side of the bed and held her pillow close to his chest. The pillow still carried her scent, and as he inhaled it, memories of cuddling, kissing, and making love to her filled his mind. Alexander realized he wouldn't be able to sleep on the bed without her beside him.So instead, he moved to the couch in the room, hoping he could maintain his patience and follow Lily's plan. If he decided to take matters into his own hands, the entire city could be thrown into chaos.
###Chapter 112

Viola played with her breakfast, showing no interest infinishing the meal.She had only eaten half and refused to continue, which made Clara and the other maids concerned.


“Viola." Clara called softly.

Viola looked up, noticing the concerned expression on Clara's face.

"Why aren't youeating,dear?”

“I'm full."

"Just try to eat a little more. Your father will be down soon, and he won't be happy to see you haven't finished," Clara encouraged,unaware that Alexander had just entered the dining room.

“Leave her be, Clara," Alexander's voice broke the silence, causing Clara to look up quickly.

Clara and the other maids immediately bowed their heads in greeting.Alexander acknowledged them with a nod before approaching his daughter. He bent down to her level, gently touching her dark hair.“Good morning, my sweet princess."

“Good morning,Daddy.”

He kissed her forehead and looked into her eyes. “What's troubling you?"


"I miss Mommy," she said with a pout.

"She'll be back before you know it," he reassured her.

“You promised I could talk to her,"
"And you will. But right now, Daddy has to go to work, and you need to get ready for your home lesson. Your teacher will be here soon."

"When can I talk to Mommy?"

Alexander ran a hand through his hair, searching for a quick response."You can talk to Mommy later this afternoon, okay?"

Viola's face lit up with a smile. “Really?”

“Yes.”

"What time will she call?”

“Anytime between 2 p.m.and 4 p.m."

“Okay, Daddy. Now I can talk to Mommy," she said happily and resumed eating her food.

Alexander watched her with a smile, pleased to see her eating again. After bidding her farewell, he left for work.

Upon arriving at the company, he noticed a crowd of reporters near the entrance. As soon as they spotted his car, they rushed toward it, trying to get his attention through the closed windows.

"Should I take the underground garage?" the driver asked.


“Yes,” Alexander responded.

The chauffeur drove into the underground garage, but the reporters chased after the caruntil security stopped them from entering the garage. The reporters waited outside, shouting his name as he exited the car.

“Mr.Kane!”
“Mr. Alexander Kane!"

"Could you tell us why you let your wife go to jail when you could have easily prevented it? Do you believe she's guilty?”

Alexander walked toward the elevator without acknowledging the reporters.Once inside, he clenched his fists, frustrated. If Lilly had followed his plan,the public would have criticized them, but now, even with her plan, they still questioned his care for her.

“People are truly unpredictable," he muttered to himself.

The reporters knew he wouldn't respond, but they still hoped for a reaction.

"Though the public wanted her jailed for the demolition, they were shocked that the powerful Alexander Kane, who could have easily prevented it, allowed it to happen. People are starting to doubt his love for his wife," a news reporter said during a live broadcast.

Ariana sipped her coffee as she watched the news, feeling pleased.Everything was going according to her plan, and she was eager to take the next step.

"Emily!"she called out to her assistant, who hurried into the office.

“Yes,ma'am?”Emily responded, her heart racing. She couldn't understand why Ariana insisted on calling her loudly instead of using the phone.

Ariana looked her up and down. "Now that Lilly is in jail, I'm the only one left to handle the project with the Blakes. Call the media and arrange a press conference in three hours at the Blake headquarters. I'll be addressing the situation with Lilly and our contract.”
Emily had no idea what her boss was planning, but she nodded obediently.“Right away,ma'am.”

Ariana dismissed her with a wave, and three hours later, a large crowd of reporters had gathered outside the Blake headquarters. Employees and security personnel were puzzled by the media presence, especially since both the CEO and Chairman were absent. While they were tryingto figure out what was happening, a luxury BMW pulled up, and Ariana stepped out,exuding professionalism.

The reporters, knowing why they were there, immediately swarmed around her. Ariana acted surprised, as if she hadn't expected them.

"Miss Martins!" they called out.

"Miss Ariana Martins!"

Several reporters tried to get her attention.

"What are your thoughts on Mrs. Kane's current situation?"

Ariana placed a hand over her heart, feigning sadness. “First,let's have a moment of silence for those who lost their lives in the demolition," she said with a somber tone, bowing her head.

The reporters and even the viewers of the live broadcast followed suit,bowing their heads in silence. This simple act increased public sympathy for Ariana and fueled the anger against Lilly.

After a few moments, Ariana looked up, her eyes glistening with tears.which touched the reporters and viewers alike.

“I'm sorry for being emotional," she said, her voice breaking. “It's heartbreaking to think of those innocent lives lost, buried under the rubble.
Who could have done such a terrible thing?”

The employees were shocked by her words, realizing that she was subtly stoking the fire.

"She's so manipulative," one employee muttered angrily.

“Miss Martins, are you implying that Mrs. Kane is responsible for the demolition? Aren't you two close?" another reporter asked.

Ariana wiped away her tears. "Lilly Blake and I are very close.”

Everyone, including the employees, was stunned to hear her use Lilly's maiden name instead of her married name, knowing how fiercely Alexander defended his wife's name.

"I have an ongoing project with the Blake company, so I'm also indirectly affected by what's happening. The company's stock is plummeting, and I juast hope those responsible are brought to justice so things can return to normal.”

“Are you going to dissolve your contract with them or wait until this is over, given that many other companies have already pulled out?" a reporter asked.

Ariana shook her head. "As I said, Lilly and I are close, so I won't jeopardize our relationship because of this. I value family and friendship deeply. Therefore, I, Ariana Martins III, will oversee our project with the Blake empire until my dear friendLilly returns."

This statement won her even more public approval, causing the stock of Martins' company to surge.

In a high-end hotel, Sarah clenched her fists, seething with anger."That
vile woman, she's such a fraud! I could kill her!" she shouted.

"Calm down, love. Think of the baby. The doctor said you shouldn't get upset," Anthony said, trying to soothe her with a gentle massage.

Instead of calming her, his words only fueled her rage. “Don't tell me to calm down! Not when Lilly is in jail because of that lunatic!" Sarah pointed at Ariana's image on the TV.

"I don't understand why Lilly would choose to go to jail!" Sarah fumed,unable to comprehend her friendI's decision.

“Calm down. I'm sure Alexander and Lilly have a plan. You know them better than anyone."

“What kind of plan involves her going to jail?!"

"Let's wait and see." Anthony suggested.

“But-”

“Enough! End of discussion," Anthony said firmly. He was loving but could be strict when necessary.

Sarah fell silent, deciding to vent her frustration to Jacob later since Anthony was losing patience.

Meanwhile, Lilly watched Ariana's interview from her cell with a smile.“Oh, Ariana, you're such a good actress. Enjoy your moment in the spotlight while it lasts," she thought to herself.
###Chapter 113

Even in confinement, she enjoyed privileges that allowed her to do whatever she pleased. She had access to a smart TV, a smartphone to contact anyone she wished, and other luxuries uncommon in a typical prison setting. The only liberty she lacked was the ability to move about freely.


Staying in this place would help her meticulously plan her next move against Ariana, who had betrayed her and tried to improve her public image at her expense.

As she paced around her plush cell, the iron door creaked open, causing her to stop and look towards it. She silently wished they were coming to inform her of a visitor, hoping it was Alexander. Just one night in the cell made her longfor him and their child even more.

When the door opened, Alexander stepped in. Overjoyed,she rushed to him. wrapping her arms around him and even jumping into his embrace like a child.

Alexander's heart warmed at her joy. On his way there, he had worried that she might be sad or overwhelmed by being locked up, and he had already decided that if she showed any signs of distress, he would get her out immediately.

"I missed you, Alexander," she murmured, resting her head on his chest while holding him close.

"I missed you too, more than you can imagine," Alexander replied, smiling as he wrapped his arms around her and lifted her chin to give her a kiss.

She returned his kiss, and after a while, they both pulled away.
"How's Viola?"

"She's been asking to hear your voice. The rest of us have been coming up with stories to tell her instead of letting her know you're here."

She sighed,feeling dstressed. "Since I have a phone here, I can call her from time to time."


"Yes, you should call her now."

"You're right. I should," she agreed, about to let go of him to make the call,but Alexander pulled her back into a tight embrace.

Surprised by his action, she smiled. "Didn't you say I should call hernow?



"Let's just stay like this for a bit longer, and then you can call her later,"he replied, closing his eyes as he held her tightly, inhaling her scent. He had made sure she had her preferred shampoo and skincare products, not wanting her to use anything provided by the prison.

They spent quality time together, even making love.Alexander didn't want to leave her, but eventually, his visiting time was over, and he had to go.

Later that day, she called Viola and spoke with her. Viola was thrilled to hear her mother's voice, and they talked for an hour before ending the call.After speaking with her mother, Viola was in high spirits, especially when reassured that they would speak every day.

To keep Viola unaware of the situation, Alexander had restricted her access to the internet and gadgets, telling her she needed to focus on her studies.
At the Blake residence, Caleb was busy writing when Blake's right-hand man,Victor, entered the office after being granted permission.

"Sir," he greeted with a bow.

Caleb looked up. "Why are you here? I don't recall sending for you," he asked with his deep, authoritative voice.

"You didn't. but I came to ask what your plan is regarding the current situation."


Knowing what Victor, mneant, Caleb replied immediately, "Nothing."

Victor looked at him in surprise, knowing how much Caleb loved his daughter. He hadn't expected this response. "Are you planning to leave her in jail?"

"And what makes you think that?"

"You just said you'd do nothing."

Caleb paused his writing and looked at Victor again. "That's because she asked me not to intervene. Do you think I'm happy she's in there?" Caleb frowned.

"I'm sorry for speaking out of turn."

"You didn't speak out of turn, Victor. I know you're worried, too. She grew up right before your eyes."

Victor nodded,saying nothing more.

"You may go if that's all."

Victor bowed his head and left the study, hoping that Lilly knew what she
was doing. She had asked not just her father but also her husband to stay out of it. What was she planning?

Three weeks later, it was finally the day of the first court hearing concerning the demolition of the orphanages and the foundation associated with the Blake family, which had been torn down with Lilly's approval.All of Lilly's family members, including her husband, were present at the court,waiting for the trial to begin. The police vehicle carrying Lilly had yet to arrive.

A reporter stood outside the courtroom, broadcasting live.

Ariana entered the courtroom dressed entirely in white, from her gown to her shoes. Her arrival drew the attention of everyone in the room.

Sarah clenched her fists at the sight of Ariana. "What is she doing here?"

Anthony placed his hand over hers to calm her. "Promise me you won't cause a scene when the hearing is over."

Sarah frowned at him. "No promises."

"Please," he pleaded.

"Let go of me," she said, pulling her hand away and crossing her arms.

Anthony looked at her, then sighed in frustration.

Alexander ignored Ariana entirely. Sitting near him were Richard and Ethan.

Ariana sat directly across from him so he could see her, but he never once glanced in her direction.

If it were up to him, he would have had her removed from the courtroom,
but the presence of numerous reporters made him hold back. Causing a scene wouldn't make Lilly happy.


Lilly was brought into the courtroom without handcuffs. Alexander had made sure she wouldn't be shackled and arranged for her to wear an expensivesuit instead of a prison uniform. She entered the room looking well-dressed, even wearing heels.


Seeing this, Ariana clenched her fists tightly. She had expected to see Lilly in a prison uniform, disheveled and handcuffed, but instead,Lilly was glammed up.wearing a suit more expensive than Ariana's outfit.

Ariana glanced at Alexander and saw him smiling at Lilly, even saying something to her from across the room. This enraged Ariana.

He still trusted and loved Lilly deeply.

But after today's hearing, Ariana was certain that trust would be shattered.
###Chapter 114

The judge entered the courtroom, prompting everyone to stand and then sit after the judge took their seat. The hearing was being streamed live on television and online, ensuring that everyone, whether at work or at home,could watch. The reason for the live broadcast was to prevent any manipulation of the case by the powerful and influential Blake and Kane families. The public demanded a transparent and fair trial, with no room for dishonesty.


Lilly sat in the front row beside her two attorneys, who were managing her case, while the prosecutors sat across from them. She was called to the witness stand, where she was required to swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, with her hand on the Holy Scriptures.

Soon,the prosecutor stood and approached her.

"Mrs. Kane, can you tell the court where you were on the 6th of last month?"

"I was at Blake Headquarters."

"What were you doing there?"

"My job; I'm the CEO of the company."

"By CEO, you mean the chief executive officer, the person responsible for overseeing all company operations?"

"That's correct," she responded.

"Good. As CEO, you have the authority to give orders to anyone in the company except the chairman. Is that correct?"
"Yes."

The prosecutor turned to the judge. "Mrs. Kane is not only the CEO of her family's company but also the heir to the Blake empire. As such, her signature is required on any significant document within the company.According to the evidence here, Mrs. Lilly Kane signed the order for the demolition of the orphanages and foundations under her family's name.What's more, she instructed for the demolition to occur without prior notice and in the dead of night." The prosecutor handed a copy of the document allegedly signed by Lilly to the court deputy, who then gave it to the judge. The judge reviewed the document and accepted it as evidenace.

"Mrs. Kane, could you explain to the court why you signed such a document? Why did you order the buildings to be demolished, and why would you endanger innocent lives? What was your motive?" the prosecutor demanded, his voice rising in accusation.

Her attorney immediately stood up in objection. "Objection, Your Honor!The prosecutor is accusing my client of murder without a guilty verdict."

Alexander clenched his fists at the prosecutor's accusation, while Sarah fumed with anger, barely calmed by Anthony's efforts.

"How dare he call her a murderer," she seethed.

Caleb sat quietly, listening intently to the proceedings. The only person who seemed to be in a good mood was Ariana. Lilly, on the other hand,remained calm and emotionless.

Alexander kept his gaze on Lilly, concerned about how she was holding up under the pressure.

"My Lord. I'm merely asking a question that the defendant needs to
answer," the prosecutor continued.

"Objection sustained. Prosecutor, please keep your questions direct," the judge instructed.


The prosecutor bowed slightly to the judge before returning to his line of questioning, this time more straightforwardly.

"Mrs. Lilly Kane, can you tell this court why you authorized the demolition of the buildings?"

Instead of answering immediately, Lilly glanced around the courtroom, her gaze finally resting on Ariana, who was staring back at her. Lilly locked eyes with her, giving her a piercing look. Ariana shivered under Lilly's cold stare, momentarily fearing that Lilly had figured out she was behind all of this. However, she quickly dismissed the thought, reasoning that if Lilly knew, she wouldn't have allowed herself to be imprisoned. Ariana then calmed herself and offered Lilly a small, reassuring smile, as if she were on her side.

Lilly finally answered, "I did not sign any document authorizing the demolition of the buildings. I could never do such a thing. I have a conscience."

"You claim you couldn't just wake up one day and dlecide to do such a thing,and I agree. According to our evidence, you instructed that the document be prepared before you signed it on the 6th. So it was a premeditated action," the prosecutor stated before turning to the audience.

"Mrs. Kane must have planned this for some time, and there's a reason behind it that we haven't uncovered yet. There's an old saying: 'When one rat in a group is infected, to eliminate the threat, all the rats are killed.'Could it be that Mrs. Kane had a specific target, and to cover her tracks,
she decided to get rid of everyone else as well?" the prosecutor speculated.noticing the angry glares from Alexander and the others. He quickly added."It's just a question."

"My Lord, that will be all for now," the prosecutor concluded before taking his seat.


Sarah gritted her teeth, tempted to stand up and confront the prosecutor for his remarks. Meanwhile, Ariana smiled, pleased with how everything was unfolding according to her plan.

Lilly's attorney then stood up to question her.

"Mrs. Kane, it's stated that this document was signed on the 6th. Did you come across such a document?"

"No, I didn't. I'm very organized. My assistant is the only one allowed to bring documents to me for signing, and I always review them carefully before signing,"

"Good. The public believes you instructed that this document be prepared.Did you do that?"

"No, I didn't. I never asked for it to be prepared, nor did I authorize the demolition. I was shocked and heartbroken when I found out. The orphanages and foundations were established in my and my late sister's names because we made our father promise to build them for orphans and the less fortunate. Why would I want to destroy something so dear to me?"

Lilly's lawyer nodded and then addressed the judge.

′′MyLord, I would like to call Miss Katrina Cade. Mrs. Kane's assistant.to the witness stand."
The judge granted the request, and Katrina was brought forward. She swore to tell the truth on the Holy Scriptures.

"Miss Cade, did you ever see a document like this?" The lawyer held up the demolition order for her to see.


"No. I never saw such a document, nor did I take anything like it to my boss for signing. I'm also responsible for organizing her desk and checking her work bag, and I nevercame across this file."

"Given that you didn't see this document, what do you think happened?"

"The original document was found by the prosecution's office among the files in the company's file shelf the morning after the demolition.Everyone on the 49th floor, myself included, was shocked. We couldn't understand how it appeared there, and there's no CCTV footage showing how it got there."

"What do you think happened?" the lawyer asked again.

"My boss was framed," Katrina's declaration caused the reporters in the room to whisper and jot down her statement.

"And what do you think of her signature on the document?" the lawyer inquired, aiming to show the court that Llly was being set up.

"Signatures can be forged. My boss would never do such a thing. She's an honorable woman. Someone is trying to frame her, but I'm confident that person will be exposed," Katrina said with certainty, making Lilly smile.

Ariana clenched her fists at Katrina's words.

"Thank you, Miss Cade," the lawyer said before turning to the judge.
"My Lord. you've heard the testimony. Someone with ill intentions fabricated that document and forged Mrs. Kane's signature."

"What evidence do you have that the signature was forged?" the judge asked, not willing to rely solely on Katrina's testimony.

The prosecutor felt a surge of hope at the judge's queston,while Ariana's smug expression began to fade when the lawyer announced that they had proof.


"I understand, Your Honor. Wehave evidence to support our claim," the lawyer confirmed.
###Chapter 115

Prosecutor Yul was taken aback by Lawyer Stone's unexpected claim. If there were any proof, he should have known about it by now.So,what was this supposed evidence?

The crowd in the courtroom began to murmur, wondering what this evidence could be, as Mrs. Kane wouldn't still be in jail if there had been any solid proof.

"Quiet down!" the court deputy ordered.

The judge leaned back in his chair and asked, "Where is this evidence?"

Lawyer Stone returned to his desk and retrieved a folder and a device.

Ariana's heart raced as she realized there was indeed some form of proof.What could possibly be in that file that might expose the truth? She was confident she had covered all her tracks thoroughly.

"We live in a time where technology can do just about anything," Lawyer Stone began. "What I hold here is a device from Japan designed to detect forged documents and signatures. While a forgery may look identical to the original to the naked eye, this device can reveal the truth. The Japanese government, along with every other country that has imported this device, including ours, has approved its use."

He handed the judge a file containing the device's approval and proof that the demolition document was forged.

Everyone watched silently as the judge examined the documentsto verify their validity. After a few minutes, the judge looked up at Lawyer Stone."
This document will be accepted, but you must demonstrate the device's
accuracy in front of everyone."

"Of course, your honor. However, I will need the prosecution to provide the original demolition file."

The judge nodded and turned to Prosecutor Yul. "Please provide the original document."

Prosecutor Yul stood, cleared his throat, and hesitated. This turn of events had caught him off guard, disrupting his strategy against Lily.

"Your honor, the originaI document is not here."

"What do you mean it's not here?" the judge demanded.

Prosecutor Yul had assumed the original wouldn't be needed, given that all evidence pointed to Lily, so he had only brought a copy. "I apologize,your honor. I mistakenly brought a copy instead of the original."

"Can the copy be tested?" the judge asked Lawyer Stone.

"No, your honor. To demonstrate the device's capability, we must use the original document."

"I see. Since the original is not present, the prosecution has three hours to produce it. We will reconvene after that time," the judge said, striking his gavel.

"Court is adjourned!" the deputy announced, and everyone stood as the judge exited the room.

Alexander approached Lily, embraced her, and kissed her forehead."Once this is over, you'll be free," he assured her.

Lily smiled and nodded.
Ariana clenched her fists, feeling her nails dig into her palms. If the signature was proven to be a forgery, Lily would be released and could return home, continuing to attend court as the case progressed. Ariana needed to ensure Lily stayed in jail a bit longer. She had planned for Lily to remain behind bars until the trial concluded, but now that her release seemed imminent, she had to act fast. For the past three weeks, she had tried in vain to get Alexander's attention, but he continued to ignore her as if she didn't exist.


Thinking quickly, Ariana left the courtroom and found a secluded spot to make a call.

Meanwhile, the internet buzzed with videos from the first court session,and everyone eagerly awaited the next development.

Three hours later, the court reconvened. Everyone took their seats as the judge reentered, and they all stood.

Once everyone was settled, the judge asked the prosecutor for the original document.

Prosecutor Yul stood up nervously. "Your honor, we are still waiting for the assistant prosecutor to arrive with it."

"How long until he arrives?" the judge inquired.

"He should be here any moment now," Prosecutor Yul replied.

"Very well,we will wait," the judge said.

The courtroom sat in anticipation, but an hour passed, and the assistant prosecutor had yet to arrive.

"Prosecutor Yul, what's happening?"
Before Prosecutor Yul could respond, a man rushed into the courroom but was immediately stopped by the police.

"Who are you, and why are you here?" the judge demanded.

"I work here at the court. I was told to inform the court that the assistant prosecutor was in a serious car accident and has been rushed to the hospital."


The news shocked everyone, including the judge, and the courtroom buzzed with whispers.

Alexander frowned, knowing this would likely delay the trial.

The judge sighed sadly. "Given the circumstances, this case is adjourned for three days. I advise both the defense and prosecution to bring all necessary documents, evidence, and witnesses so we can conclude this matter next time."

Both Lawyer Stone and Prosecutor Yul nodded in agreement.

The judge struck his gavel before leaving the courtroom. Alexander turned to Lily and kissed her. "Take care. I promise that by the next hearing,all of this will be behind us."

Lily nodded. She looked at her grandfather, her father, Sarah, and others before waving goodbye as the police escorted her back to jail. Surprisingly,she didn't seem upset; instead, she smiled, recognizing that Ariana was digging herself deeper without even realizing it.

As soon as the session ended, Ariana made her move towards Alexander.blocking his path. She intended to act before the next hearing.

"Hi, Alexander," she greeted casually, but her tone disgusted him. He
walked past her as if she were invisible, got into his car, and drove away.leaving Ariana hurt.

"What did you just call him?" Sarah confronted Ariana outside the courtroom, where reporters eagerly awaited any bit of news.

"That's none of your business," Ariana shot back. "I was talking to him,not you."


"You have no right tospeak to Alexander Kane," Sarah retorted, her expression stern.

"Says who?"

"When did you start calling him Alexander instead of Mr. Kane? You two aren't close, and didn't you claim to have lost your memory? So why act familiar with him?"

"Even if I lost my memory. I know about the relationship we had and the mistakes I made. I just want us to be friends again."

Sarah laughed loudly, drawing attention from onlookers, including Anthony, who had been talking to Ethan and hadn't noticed his fiery pregnant wife walking off to confront Ariana. Realizing the potential scene she could cause. Anthony excused himself and approached them.

"No, you cannot be friends with Alexander. I forbid it. Stay away from this family," Sarah declared.

"You can't force me to stay away. I'll keep my distance if theyask me to.not because you say so," Ariana retorted.

Sarah clenched her fists, about to strike Ariana, but Anthony intervened,gently lowering her hand and massaging it to calm her down.
"Not here, my love," Anthony whispered, reminding her of the crowd.

Ariana smirked, brushing her hair back. She couldn't understand what someone as powerful as Anthony saw in Sarah, a woman with such a sharp tongue.

"Just let me handle her!" Sarah demanded.

"Not today, darling," Anthony said softly, moving closer to her."You'll have your chance when the time is right. But for now, stay calm. There are too many people watching."

Sarah, who had been angry at him moments before, smiled at his suggestion.He was right; she needed to bide her time. She would certainly get her chance to deal with Ariana later.

Meanwhile, Alexander had instructed his team to investigate the assistant prosecutor's accident, needing to determine whether it was a genuine accident or orchestrated by someone trying to keep Lily behind bars by delaying the court from uncovering the truth.
###Chapter 116

For the first time, Alexander was going to sit down and share a drink with his father-in-law, Peter Blake. After the court hearing the day before, Peter had asked if they could have dinner and drinks together, preferring a quiet location.


Alexander, who had access to many high-end restaurants, chose to reserve a spot at his newly built 15-star hotel since his father-in-law wanted somewhere peaceful. He selected a table with a view of the entire city from the 60th floor, a restaurant so exclusive that only the wealthiest could afford to dine there. This was where he would meet with Peter.

Peter was the first to arrive and was shown to the table. He took a seat and admired the breathtaking view. Alexander certainly had excellent taste.This hotel, located in the heart of the city, had garnered a lot of attention.Peter couldn't help but acknowledge that his son-in-law was an astute businessman.

After just five minutes, Alexander arrived. He walked over to the table and nodded respectfully to his father-in-law. "Father," he greeted.

"Please, have a seat, Alexander," Peter replied.

Alexander sat down, and they promptly ordered. While waiting for their meal, Peter spoke up. "Is there a particular reason you wanted us to have dinner? What do you want to discuss?" Alexander inquired, knowing he had a lot of work waiting for him. Over the past three weeks,with Lily in prison, he had developed a routine-spending mornings with Viola,afternoons with Lily in her cell, and working late into the night at the office.

"With everything that's been happening, I thought this would be the right
time for us to sit down andI talk. Tell me, how are you handling all of this?I know it hasn't been easy for you, Alexander. Sometimes you make choices I wouldn't have made. You could have approached this situation differently, but you chose the right path."

"It hasn't been easy," Alexander admitted.

"I know," Peter replied. "My father mentioned that you visit Lily in her cell every day. You really love her, don't you?" Peter knew Alexander loved his daughter, but he wanted to hear it from him directly.

Alexander paused while pouring wine into his glass, glancing at his father-in-law. Was this some sort of test? Hadn't his actions shown how much he loved Lily? "I do, more than you can imagine," he said, his voice firm.He loved Lily so deeply that he was willing to do anything for her. He had only been patient with the situation because Lily wanted to pursue the legal route.

Peter nodded, acknowledging Alexander's words. "I know you do. Even with her in jail, accused of ordering the demolition, you've continued to trust her. I'm so grateful that my daughter found someone like you. I couldn't have wished for a better man for her. I wish I had been half as good to her mother." He ended on a note of regret.

Alexander looked at Peter, realizing the sincerity in his words. "We should eat before the food gets cold," Alexander suggested.

Peter agreed.

After a few bites, Peter asked, "What will you do if things don't go as planned? What if my daughter pleads guilty? How will you handle that?"He knew Lily was innocent but wanted to know how Alexander would respond in such a sítuation.
"I've only been patient because that's what she wanted. If I had done things my way, she wouldn't have ended up in jail. But she will never be found guilty because she is innocent, and everything has been prepared accordingly."


Peter nodded, saying nothing more. He wished he could be more like Alexander. If he had been, his life might have turned out differently. His wife would still be alive, and his two daughters would be as well.Alexander,who had endured a difficult childhood and once harbored a deep resentment towards women, had come to value family above all else.Peter knew Alexander was committed to doing everything he could to keep his family safe and together. If only Peter had done the same,perhaps he wouldn't be so alone now.

After finishing their dinner, they moved to the bar area of the restaurant and shared a few drinks. Peter had to leave after receiving a call from his father, but Alexander stayed behind, continuing to drink. He had tried to avoid alcohol, but the suggestion to drink with his father-in-law had rekindled his craving, something he hadn't indulged in for quite some time.

Alexander kept drinking until he was noticeably tipsy. One of the waitresses, who had been watching him from a distance, made a call to Ariana. Arianà had instructed her to keep an eye on Alexander at the restaurant. She had been waiting for the perfect opportunity to carry out her plan, and learning that Alexander was drunk presented her with the chance she had been seeking.

Ariana immediately drove to the hotel and headed to the floor where the restaurant was located. Disguised as a waitress, she managed to approach Alexander without raising suspicion among his guards.
She walked over to him with a tray holding another glass of wine.Alexander, without even glancing at the person who served him, drank it.In his normal state, he wouldn't have accepted a drink from a stranger.

Ariana smiled in satisfaction as he drank it and quickly left before any of his guards could recognize her. She booked a room close to the presidential suite, knowing that Alexander, now heavily intoxicated and with something extra in his drink to induce deep sleep, would likely be taken there.


About two hours later, she received a call from one of the hotel staff,confirming that Alexander had been moved to the presidential suite.Ariana was thrilled; she was about to have the night of her life with him.Now all she needed to do was find a way into his suite.

After about thirty minutes, she sent the waitress to get the guards drunk.Once they were sufficiently distracted, Ariana sneaked into the room,which was completely dark with the lights turned off.

She slowly approached Alexander, who was sound asleep on the bed.Even though she knew how intoxicated he was, she still moved cautiously.

Ariana undressed and climbed into bed. This was her chance, and she wasn't going to miss it for anything.
###Chapter 117

She had only one opportunity, and she wasn't about to let it slip away.The sharp aroma of alcohol lingered as she neared his bedside. Alexander was still dressed and deeply asleep. With delicate, careful motions, she began unfastening his suit jacket, trying not to rouse him. The faint sound of the fabric shifting seemed to echo in the quiet room.

As sheundid each button, Ariana felt a mix of worry and affection for Alexander. He had been through a lot lately, and it was obvious he had sought solace in drinking. She knew she was the cause of his troubles,but if she hadn't taken her previous actions, she wouldn't be by his side now.She needed to get Lily locked away, even though it would hurt Alexander;eventually, he'd move on, and she would take her place beside him. If her plan didn't succeed, she was ready to rethink and try again, determined to keep him and Lily apart so she could finally step in.

Gently, she slid his jacket off, revealing the crisp dress shirt underneath.The room was so quiet she could hear the slow, rhythmic sound of his breathing. But as she began to remove his shirt, he stirred. His grip tightened around her hand, and his alcohol-heavy eyes met hers.

Ariana froze, their eyes locking in a silent exchange. In that instant, she saw a mnix of vulnerability and confusion in his gaze. Even in his drunken state, it was as if he was reaching out to her. She wasn't sure what to say.but her presence alone conveyed her deep feelings for him.

"Who are you?” he asked, his vision blurred by the darkness, making it hard to see her face clearly, only her eyes.

In the dim room, their eyes were the only things they could see of each other. Ariana whispered softly, "It's me, Lily. I'm here for you,Alexander."
Her tone was full of warmth and reassurance, hoping that by pretending to be Lily, she could ease his discomfort and gain his trust to do what she intended. She believed acting as Lily would bring him some peace in his intoxicated state.


“Lily?" he murmured, touching her face. "How are...you here?" Lily was supposed to be in prison, with the trial not scheduled until the day after tomorrow.How could she be here now? Had he somehow lost track of time and slept for days?

Ariana waited anxiously to see what he would do next. It pained her to use Lily's name, but she had no other choice. She was ready to see if he would pull her close and kiss her, thinking she was Lily.

But instead of doing that, he gently touched her hair, then paused and looked deeply into her eyes. Suddenly, Alexander pulled her closer, which thrilled her, thinking she was about to get what she wanted. But as he inhaled her scent, realizing it was different, he shoved her away so forcefully that she landed on the floor, crying out in pain.

"Who are you, and what are you doing in my room?" He was repulsed by the idea of another woman touching him apart from Lily. The thought that she had almost undressed him disgusted him.

Though he was drunk, his mind had cleared a bit. Ariana was in shock;he had recognized that she wasn't Lily by her scent. She realized her mistake-she should have discovered Lily's scent and used it on herself to imitate her more convincingly. Her plan was falling apart.

Alexander stood from the bed and started toward her. Ariana quickly scrambled to her feet and darted toward the door.

“Guards!”Alexander shouted, but no one responded, explaining how she
had gotten in-his guards must have been drunk as well. This was clearly a setup, and he was determined to find out who this woman was.

As Alexander charged at her, he suddenly felt weak and collapsed onto the floor. Ariana was relieved he hadn't caught her. The drink she had given him earlier was still working. She fled from his room, hurried to her own,packed her things, and left the hotel immediately.

The next morning, when Alexander woke, he had only a hazy recollection of the night before. He vaguely remembered a woman impersonating Lily and regretted not finding out who she was. But there was still a way to discover her identity. Alexander instructed James, who had arrived at the hotel, to check the guest list from the previous night.

After investigating, James found the name, and Alexander was furious when he learned it was Ariana. He would have been less upset if it had been someone else, but the fact that it was Ariana enraged him even more.How was he going to explain this to Lily? What if she found out?Alexander couldn't bear the thought.

"Take me to Ariana's residence,” he ordered, and his chauffeur drove him to the estate where Ariana had purchased a house. If not for Lily's request to let her stay in the estate, Alexander would have kicked her out long ago.

The car stopped outside her house, and Alexander stepped out, looking as handsome as ever in his clean, expensive suit. When Samson saw him, he went inside to inform Ariana.

Ariana was just descending the stairs, fully dressed, when Samson told her that Alexander was there. Her bag slipped from her hand when she heard his name. Under different circumstances, she would have been thrilled to have him visit, but not now. She was certain he was there because he had discovered she was the one who entered his hotel room the previous night.
He was going to kill her.

She had made a huge mistake by not having her name removed from the guest list at the hotel. She had only instructed security to erase the CCTV footage of her entering and leaving his room. She hadn't thought he would remember what happened since he was so drunk. She had spent two years planning to win Alexander back, only to make sucha foolish mistake. Her goal was to sleep with him and get pregnant, believing that having his child would create a bond between them that would end his marriage to Lily. But her plan had failed, and now he was outside her house. Only God knew what he intended to do.

"Ma'am?” Samson called her, noticing that she was frozen in place. He picked up her bag and called her again, snapping her out of her daze.

“You said he's outside?”

“Yes,ma'am.”

They both heard the doorbell ring, and Ariana's heart raced. She couldn't deny what had happened, but she needed to come up with a convincing lie. Mustering all her courage, she walked to the door and opened it.Standing before her was a furious Alexander.

Before she could utter a word, he grabbed her by the neck and squeezed so hard that she thought she would die. Ariana gasped for air as tears streamed down her face, but Alexander didn't stop there. He lifted her with one hand, still gripping her throat.

She tried to plead with him, but she couldn't speak due to the lack of oxygen, Samson, who attempted to help her, was already being beaten by two of Alexander's guards, his nose bleeding from the assault.
Carolina,seeing what was happening from the window, rushed downstairs to see why Alexander was there, only to be horrified by the sight of him strangling her daughter. Ariana must have done something terrible, but Carolina couldn't just stand by and watch her daughter being choked to death.


"Please stop!" Carolina cried out, catching Alexander's attention.

Seeing the elderly woman's tears, Alexander released his grip and let Ariana drop to the floor as if she were nothing. Carolina rushed to her daughter's side, urging her to breathe. Ariana gasped for air, finally stabilizing, but her neck throbbed with pain, already bruised and bleeding where Alexander's nails had dug into her skin.

She looked up at him with tears in her eyes.

"Please leave,"Carolina begged Alexander.

"This is your final warning. Stay away from me and my family,or next time, I won't hesitate to kill you," he said before storming out of the house.

Carolina glanced at Samson, who was severely beaten by Alexander's guards. Just when she thought it was over, James walked in and threw a document at Ariana's feet.

“You have three days to vacate this house. Your money will be refunded within three hours," James stated before leaving.

Carolina sighed,“What did you do. Ariana? I know he wouldn't come here and strangle you for no reason."

Ariana looked at her mother with tear-filled eyes, "I...”

“You what?” Carolina screamed. "Look at Samson! He's in a terrible state
because of whatever you did!"

Ariana slowly got up and began to walk upstairs.

"So now you're walking away from me?" Carolina shouted, but Ariana didn't respond.

"You need to stop whatever you're doing, Ariana! It's enough!"

"Stop?" Ariana paused and turned to face her mother, looking at her as if she were crazy. “Why should I stop when I've just begun?" she sneered.

"Do you think Alexander choking me because I triedto sleep with him will make me stop?”

Carolina's face went pale. "What did you just say?”

"Yes! I drugged him and tried tosleep with him because I wanted to have his child!" Ariana shouted, her throat burning with pain. “My goal is to be with Alexander, and I'll do whatever it takes to make that happen, Mother!I don't care if he chokes me a thousand times. In the end, I'll be the one by his side!"

Carolina felt weak to her core. She didn't know what to do to make her daughter stop. It wasn't enough to have Lily jailed. She could only pray that Ariana wouldn't resort to killing Lily just to get Alexander.
###Chapter 118

On the second day of the trial, a heavy sense of unease gripped everyone present at the courthouse. The courtroom was noticeably more packed than the day before, and there was an air of expectation that hung over the proceedings.

Alexander, who had recently been through a lot, stood with his family,who had come to support him during Lily's trial. He was relieved that,during the time Lily was incarcerated, they managed to keep everything hidden from Viola. Lily was able to stay in touch with Viola daily thanks to a phone she was provided while in jail.

The prosecutor and the defense attorney arrived at the courthouse.

Sarah and her group arrived as well, and she was pleased to see that Ariana was not present. Her absence was proof that she wasn't as loyal as she claimed to be-Sarah believed Ariana was only interested in seeing Lily declared guilty, which is why she didn't want to witness the proceedings today, knowing that Lily would likely be found innocent.

Among those present were Sophia and Richard. Sophia had been unable to attend the first day of the trial due to a hospital emergency. This time.Sandra was also there, having returned from a trip abroad during the first hearing.

Caleb, Lily's grandfather, a respected and authoritative figure in the family.was also present, displaying his usual stoic demeanor as he faced the legal proceedings. He had visited Lily in jail the day before,where she had informed him about what would happen in court today.

Ariana, however, chose not to enter the courthouse. Instead, she stayed at home, watching the events unfold live on her television. She didn't want
to be there to witness Lily being exonerated.

Lily was brought into the courtroom, dressed in a long-sleeved white silk blouse,cream-colored pants, black shoes, and her hair neatly tied back.

Alexander smiled, admiring how beautiful she looked in the outfit.

The judge entered, and everyone stood up.

Soon after, the courtroom settled, and the trial commenced.

"Prosecutor Yul, please provide the original file," the judge ordered.

Prosecutor Yul nodded and handed the original file to Lawyer Stone, who took it and proceeded to conduct a test in front of everyone.

All eyes were on Lawyer Stone as he prepared the device for testing.ensuring everyone could see it, leaving no room for doubts about tampering. After the test was completed, it was revealed that thedocument was forged-it was not an official document issued by Blake.

Everyone, including the prosecution, was shocked-the forgery was so expertly done that it appeared legitimate, even bearing the CEO's seal.

The prosecutor conducted their own tests, which confirmed the forgery.The prosecution team felt humiliated.

The reporters quickly captured photographs of the document and the evidence proving it was a forgery, and the story spread rapidly online.

"This is unbelievable. Mrs. Kane is innocent-she was framed!" a fan exclaimed online.

Many who had turned against the Kane family began to reconsider their stance after seeing the evidence of Lily's innocence.
"We were wrong not to believe in Lily Kane. I feel terrible now," another fan confessed in a comment.

However,even with the document proven to be fabricated, Lawyer Stone requested to continue the trial.


"Are you certain you want to continue? Mrs. Kane's innocence has been established; there's no need to prolong the case," the judge said.


"Yes,Your Honor, but my client wishes to fully clear her name and that of her family. People might speculate that this was all orchestrated by the Blakes, and to prevent such rumors, we have decided to proceed and identify the true culprit."


"The true culprit?"

"Yes, Your Honor. We have evidence revealing the real perpetrator."


The courtroom buzzed with surprise.

"Silence!" the deputy chief ordered,and the room quieted.

"If that's your decision, proceed," the judge allowed.

"Thank you, Your Honor," Lawyer Stone said,bowing his head.


He returned to his table and picked up a file.

"During the first hearing, the assistant prosecutor, who was supposed to deliver the original file, was involved in an accident. The medical records and other evidence in this file prove that the accident was a hit-and-run.orchestrated to prevent the delivery of the original document to the court."

The courtroom was stunned by this revelation, and those watching the trial live were equally shocked.
Ariana, who was watching from home, dropped her teacup in shock. She hadn't expected anyone to uncover this detail. She had made another mistake.


God only knew what else they had discovered. The lawyer had mentioned exposing the culprit, wwhich likely meant they knew she was involved. Her hands and feet trembled as she paced around her room, trying to think of her next move.


"Ariana, are you okay? I heard something break-did you hurt yourself?"Carolina asked, concerned. She had come to check on her during a break.

"I'm...I'm fine, Mother...no need to worry," Ariana replied, her voice shaky.

"Are you sure you're okay?"

"Yes, I'm fine, Mother. Just leave!" Ariana screamed. Carolina hesitated but eventually left.

Once she was sure her mother had gone, Ariana immediately went to her safe. She punched in the password, opened it, and grabbed one of the burner phones inside. She dialed a number, and the person picked up on the first ring.

"I need you to take the fall for me. Do whatever it takes to keep me out of trouble," she instructed. After the person responded, Ariana sighed in relief and ended the call.

She was relieved she hadn't gone to court; otherwise, she wouldn't have been able to make this call.

Ariana had been behind everything-the forged document, Lily's signature,and hiring an employee at Blake to sneak the document into the company's records and erase the CCTV footage. She also paid men to demolish the
buildings, killing everyone inside, and secretly sent them out of the country afterward.


She had executed her plan so cleverly that she believed no one would ever discover it, but it seemed she had underestimated Lily once again.

Back in the courtroom, Lawyer Stone presented another document containing records of the heavy machinery used to demolish the buildings.

"The records show that the bulldozers used were from Blake,but they were taken without authorization from the warehouse. Unknown individuals accessed the warehouse and used the machinery to demolish the buildings. This suggests that someone inside Blake was bribed to facilitate this."

"There's only one person with the authority to release the machinery,"Lawyer Stone continued.


He named the person, who was immediately brought to the witness stand.

The elderly warehouse director confessed that he was paid by an unknown individual to open the warehouse late at night. He said the men took the bulldozers and returned them five hours later, the time during which the demolition occurred. He claimed he didn't realize what had happened until he saw the news the next morning. The only reason he took the bribe was to pay for his sick daughter's hospital bills.

The crowd murmured in shock.

"When we traced the call, we found that the person who contacted him used a burner phone," the lawyer revealed.

After presenting numerous pieces of evidence, Lawyer Stone called a new witness.
"I would like to bring to the stand one of the men hired by the culprit to demolish the buildings."

Ariana's heart sank as she watched one of the men she had paid and sent abroad step up to the witness stand. She recognized him as the second-in-command of the group she had hired.

Her eyes were glued to the television as she waited for his testimony.

The man revealed they had been paid to demolish the buildings.When asked who paid them, he mentioned the name of Ariana's assistant,Jamila.

The courtroom was in shock, and the internet exploded with the news.

"Oh my God, I can't believe this. Ariana used her assistant to do this!"someone commented online.

"I thought she was a saint, and to think I liked her!" another person remarked.

Ariana, unable to bear the negative comments, angrily threw her tablet against the wall.

Three hours later, Jamila was brought to court. Terrified but determined to protect her family, she took the witness stand.

She was asked if Ariana Martins had instructed her to carry out these actions.

Everyone waited for her response.

"No," Jamila replied, causing Lily to frown.

"How can we be sure you're telling the truth?"
"I'm not lying. I did it all on my own. My boss is too kind and innocent to do such a thing."

"If you claim you acted alone, where did you get the money to pay for all this? According to my records, five million dollars was spent to pay everyone involved."

"Yes, my boss, Miss Martins, is a generous soul. I told her about my family's situation, and she gave me a check for ten million dollars to move them out of their home and take care of their needs. But I used five million of it for this instead."

The people in the courtroom whispered among themselves, confused by Jamila's statement. It didn't make sense-why would she do something like this?

Sarah clenched her fists. "I'm going to smack that witch when this is over.I knew it! She's pure evil, and she's trying to put all the blame on this poor assistant of hers. Who knows what she used to threaten the girl?"Sarah fumed, and Anthony tried to calm her down.

"Don't worry, you'll get your chance," he reassured her.

"Can you explain why you did this? Has Mrs. Kane done something to you that made you act against her like this?" the lawyer asked Jamila.

Jamila glanced at Lily, who was staring at her with piercing eyes. Unable to meet her gaze, Jamila looked at the lawyer instead.

"Yes,she has."
###Chapter 119

"Yes,she has."

The courtroom buzzed with whispers at this statement. Lilly was taken aback, trying to recall what she might have done to Jamila, but no memory came to mind. The first time she remembered meeting Jamila was when she had attended a meeting with Ariana at the company.

"Mrs. Kane, do you know her?" asked the lawyer.

"No, I don't," Lilly answered honestly.

"Miss Jamila, could you explain to the court how Mrs. Kane has wronged you?"

Jamila stood up, her voice shaking as she recounted a painful experience.With a deep breath, she began to tell the court how Lilly had deeply hurt her.

"I met Mrs. Kane during my time studying in country B," she began,addressing the judge and the attentive jury. "I had just started my studies,and I was struggling to make ends meet. I ran out of money and was desperately in need of food. Back then, Mrs. Kane was pursuing her master's degree:"

Jamila's voice trembled with emotion as she continued. "I approached her,with tears in my eyes, asking for a little help, just enough money to buy something to eat. But instead of showing any kindness, she looked at me like I was some kind of bother, like I didn't matter. Then, she just walked away,leaving me humiliated in front of others."

Tears filled Jamila's eyes as she relived the memory. "I cried for days.
feeling completely lost and abandoned. She could have just said no if she didn't want to help, but to ignore me in such a cold, heartless way was unforgivable. From that day on, I carried a deep hatred for Mrs. Kane,vowing to get back at her for what she had done."


The courtroom fell silent as Jamila's testimony laid bare the roots of her grudge and the motivations behind her actions. When she finished, the entire room was speechless.


"Why hold onto this resentment for so many years, only to seek revenge by doing something so cruel?" the lawyer asked. "You separated a wife from her husband, and a mother from her child, for four weeks-just because you were hurt over an incident like this?"

Jamila began to cry softly. "I'm sorry. I regret everything. I just wanted people to see her as a bad person. I didn't know it would lead to her going to jail."

"But you wanted her to be seen as evil, even as a murderer!" the lawyer exclaimed.


The room was silent, except for Jamila's soft sobs.

Lilly was bewildered. She managed a small smile, realizing Ariana had managed to shift the blame onto this poor girl. Yet, as Jamila spoke, Lilly started to remember the incident differently. Back then, she had told the young woman to wait under a tree while she withdrew money. However,when she returned after a delay at the ATM, the girl had already disappeared. At the time, Jamila had worn glasses, and Lilly hadn't known her name, which explained why she hadn't recognized her.

Even though Lilly had been declared innocent,people online criticized her for dismissing Jamila all those years ago. Jamila was sent to jail, and
another court session was scheduled to determine her punishment for her role in the demolition.

Lilly rushed to Alexander, hugging him tightly. They kissed, not caring about the people around them.

"I'm finally going home," Lilly said.

"Yes, Viola is waiting for you," Alexander replied.

Sarah and the others gathered around to hug Lilly. "I'm so glad you're free now." Sarah said.

"So am I," Lilly smiled.

"But that Ariana," Sarah continued, "I can't believe she let this innocent girl take the blame. She killed all those people just to tear you and Alexander apart. I'm glad she didn't succeed."

Lilly smiled faintly. "She didn't succeed this time, but I know she's already planning her next move."

"Gosh, I wish we could just end this," Sarah fumed. "What's Alexander planning to do about her?"

"He hasn't said yet. He's being patient because of me; otherwise,he would have handled it his way."

"I wish you'd let him handle it. He'd erase her from existence," Sarah suggested with a wry smile.

Lilly laughed softly. "Don't worry, whatever Ariana tries next will only trap her further."

Ariana, knowing things were slipping out of her control,decided to take
immediate action. She called for a press conference at her company to clear her name.


"Are you really the one behind all of this?" Carolina asked Ariana as she prepared to leave the house.

"What are you talking about?" Ariana responded with a laugh.

"The things they said at the trial-did you do it?" Carolina pressed.

Ariana chuckled again. "Please, Mother, do you think I could do all that?My assistant is the one behind it. I'm just as shocked as everyone else. I didn't realize I had such a devil working for me. Who knows, she might have come after me next! I'm just glad she's behind bars now."

Carolina sighed in relief, trusting her daughter's words. Ariana then left for the press conference,looking calm and composed as she faced the gathered reporters.

At the conference, Ariana addressed every question with grace,denying any involvement in the demolition and expressing shock at her assistant's actíons. She claimed she was as much a victim as everyone else. She also took the opportunity to publicly apologize to Lilly, acknowledging the suffering her assistant had caused and congratulating her on her newfound freedom.

As Ariana's apology played on a tablet in the car, Alexander was furious,but Lilly remained calm. Ariana's words didn't fool her. She knew all too well that Ariana had orchestrated everything, using her assistant as a scapegoat.

"Do you still want me to let her be?" Alexander asked in frustration.

Lilly met his gaze, her expression unwavering. "Yes. She's not done yet.
When she makes her next move, that's when we'll catch her."

Though Alexander had his own ideas about how to deal with Ariana, he decided to trust Lilly's plan. They both knew Ariana hadn't lost her memory-she was pretending, as part of her larger scheme. Whatever had happened between her and Alexander was over, and Lilly wasn't about to let any other woman step into her place. Alexander belonged to her, and she was determined to keep it that way.

When they arrived home, Alexander got out of the car first,followed by Lilly. As soon as she entered the house, Viola rushed to her.

"Mummy!" Viola cried as she ran into her mother's arms.

Lilly picked up her daughter, hugging her tightly and spinning her around."I missed you so much," she said, kissing her daughter's face.

"And I mnissed you too, Mummy," Viola replied, touching her mother's hair.

Tears welled up in Lilly's eyes as she held her daughter close. After nearly four weeks apart, she wwas overwhelmed with emotion.

Alexander watched from a distance, smiling at the reunion of the two people he cherished most in the world. He was willing to do anything to keep them safe.
###Chapter 120

Two weeks had passed, and the people of Aurora City had stopped discussing the drama involving the Kanes and the Blakes. It had been two full weeks since the trial ended, and Lilly had resumed her normal life.Today, however, she decided to visit Jamila, Ariana's former assistant, in prison.

Lilly and Alexander arrived at the women's correctional facility.

"Do you want me to come in with you?" Alexander asked.

"No, it's okay. I'll just go in, see her, and then we can head over to pick up Viola from Grandpa's place."

"Alright, but be careful," he said, squeezing her hand.

Lilly smiled. "With all the security you've arranged in there, I'm sure nothing will happen to me."

"I know, but still..." Alexander trailed off, looking concerned.

Lilly understood his worry and nodded. "I'll be fine, don't worry."

Alexander gave a nod, watching as Lilly stepped out of the car and made her way toward the prison entrance. He kept his eyes on her until she disappeared behind the prison gates.

Lilly was escorted to the visitor's area, where she would meet Jamila. She sat down behind a glass divider, waiting until Jamila was brought in.When Jamila finally appeared, Lilly barely recognized her.Her hair was messy, and her face and hands were covered in bruises.It was clear she had been mistreated by other inmates.
Once Jamila sat down, Lilly picked up the phone on her side of the glass partition.

"Hi, Jamila," Lilly greeted her.

Jamila glanced at Lilly but avoided eye contact, theguilt and shame apparent on her face.

"Why did you do this?" Lilly asked, voicing the question that had been on her mind ever since the trial.

Jamila bit her lip nervously. "I don't know what you're talking about. I did something wrong, and now I'm paying for it. Isn't that how it's supposed to be?"

Lilly sighed. "We both know you're not the real villain here. Yes, we met once in country B, but you didn't hold any grudge against me from that time. I know because you left when I went to get the money for you.You've been using that encounter as an excuse for your actions, but it's not the real reason."

Lilly leaned forward, her voice firm. "Ariana did all of this, didn't she?"

Jamila's face revealed a flicker of surprise, her eyes widening briefly before she tried to hide her reaction.

Lilly smiled knowingly. "I already know the truth, and I have proof to back it up."

Jamila's eyes widened further, this time in fear. She quickly looked up at Lilly, panic etched across her face. "Wha.,. what are you saying? My boss had nothing to do with this. I did it all," she stammered, fidgeting nervously with her hands.
Lilly glanced at her trembling hands. "Calm down, Jamila. I'm not going to give the evidence to the police, and do you know why?"

Jamila stared at Lilly, confused. "Why?" she asked, desperate to understand why Lilly wouldn't expose Ariana.

Lilly leaned back in her chair. "The reason you took the fall for Ariana is that she threatened you, and probably made you a promise, didn't she?"


Jamila was stunned, unable to respond. She knew Lilly had hit the truth but was too afraid to confirm it.

"You must be wondering how I know all this," Lilly continued.

Jamila gave a small nod,unable to deny it.

"I'll only tell you this-your boss is playing with the wrong person."

Lilly paused for a moment before addressing Jamila's unspoken question."
I'm not revealing Ariana's invoIvement yet because sending her to jail isn't what I want. You'll have to remain in prison for now, since that's the choice you've made. If Ariana gets arrested now, it'll ruin my entire plan."

Tears began to spill from Jamila's eyes as she fell to her knees. "Please, I'm begging you. I know you're the only one who can help my family.Ariana threatened to harm them if I didn't take the blame. I'm terrified she might hurt them even while I'm here. She's unstable."

"Get up," Lilly said firmly.

"Please, Mrs. Kane," Jamila pleaded, tears streaming down her face.

"If you don't stand up, I might change my mind," Lilly warned.

Jamila quickly rose to herfeet, wiping her tears as she sat back down.
"Good," Lilly said calmly. "Just stay in prison for now. I'll make sure your family is safe, but only because I don't want them to suffer because of your poor choices."

Jamila wiped away more tears, whispering,"Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet. Remember, you're just as guilty. You knew exactly who Ariana was, yet you still chose to help her. That's why prison is where you belong right now. Consider this your lesson."


With that, Lilly stood up, casting one last look at Jamila before leaving the room. Jamila wept silently.

Outside, Alexander anxiously checked his watch, only looking up when he saw Lilly walking back toward the car. Once she got in, she exhaled deeply.

"How did it go?" Alexander asked.

"It went well. I got her to admit that Ariana threatened her using her family."

"So, what's the plan now?" he asked, his frustration evident.

"I'll wait to see what Ariana does next. She's after you, Alexander. She's obsessed with you, and she's willing to do anything to get what she wants.But I won't let that happen."

"You think she won't try to hurt you in the process? Hlow can you expect me to stay calm and let her keep playing these games?" Alexander's patience was wearing thin.

Lilly grasped his hand, pleading softly. "I'll ask for your help when I need it. But for now, please don't do anything. Ariana wants you to act recklessly. Don't give her that satisfaction."
Annoyed, Alexander pulled his hand away. "Take us to the Blake estate,"he instructed the driver, clearly frustrated.

Lilly pouted, sensing his anger. The ride to her grandfather's house was silent, with Alexander focused on his laptop, barely acknowledging her presence.

When they arrived, the staff greeted them politely.

"Welcome, sir. Welcome,ma'am."

Lilly nodded in response, while Alexander ignored the greetings,walking straight into the house and asking Victor where their daughter was.

"She's with her great-grandfather in the study," Victor replied."He requested not to be disturbed."

Knowing where to go, Alexander headed toward the study to retrieve Viola,who had been with her great-grandfather for two days.

Lilly followed behind.

When Alexander knocked on the door, Caleb's loud voice responded,"
Didn't I say not to disturb us?"

Ignoring the comment, Alexander opened the door and stepped inside.


"Daddy! Mommy!" Viola shouted, running to her parents.

Alexander scooped her up, hugging her tightly."Did you miss Daddy?"

Viola nodded enthusiastically. "I missed you so much, Daddy,"

Lilly approached Caleb and bowed respectfully. "Hello, Grandpa."
Caleb studied his granddaughter. "You look exhausted. The triaI is over,but you still seem worn out."

"I'll be fine, Grandpa," Lilly assured him.

Caleb's eyes narrowed in concern. "If your husband isn't treating you well,you should come home.I'll take care of you. It's because of him that you're so emotionally drained. He's the one who got involved with that crazy woman, yet you're theone paying the price."

Caleb's words, spoken in front of Alexander and Viola, caused tension to rise in the room.

Sensing the growing anger, Victorapproached. "Sir, perhaps I should take Viola away for now," he suggested, realizing the child shouldn't witness any conflict.

Alexander handed Viola over to Victor, who quickly left with her.

Turning to Caleb, Alexander spoke firmly. "Do you think I want Lilly to go through this? I've told her from the start that I should handle Ariana,but she won't let me."

"Enough," Lilly interrupted. "Grandpa, I'm fine. You don't need to worry."

"Of course I have to worry," Caleb insisted, glaring at Alexander."If you don't deal with Ariana, I'll make sure my granddaughter divorces you and comes back home. I'll find someone more suitable for her."

Alexander's fists clenched so tightly that his knuckles turned white.Holding onto Lilly, he vowed, "I'Il never let that happen." Without another word,he left,guiding Lilly firmly by the hand.

Caleb seethed, worried that history would repeat itself-that another
woman would destroy the happiness of his family.

As they reached the living room. Alexander retrieved Viola from Victor. He wasn't about to let anything tear his family apart.
###Chapter 121

Lily rushed into the bathroom, feeling sick, and vomited everything she had eaten. She had been experiencing nausea and dizziness for the past few days.


"Ma'am, are you alright?" Clara asked, concerned. The other maids nearby also looked worried. They were anxious about their boss's health, knowing if anything happened to her, their master wouldn't spare them.

"I'm okay," Lily replied, wiping her face as she exited the bathroom.

“But,Ma'am, this has been going on for two days. Don't you think we should inform the boss?" Clara insisted.

"No, I don't want to worry Alexander," Lily said firmly. Alexander had been on a business trip for three days, and she didn't want to distract him from his work.

“But,Ma'amn...” Clara started again.

“He's busy, and he's out of town. I'll just have lunch with Viola, put her down for a nap, and then head to the hospital for a checkup," Lily explained.

Clara sighed but relented. “Alright, Ma'am.”

After ensuring Viola was asleep, Lily left for the hospital that Saturday afternoon. She was casually dressed in a simple t-shirt tucked into blue jeans, paired with heels. Despite her simple attire, she still looked graceful.

When she arrived at Wright Hospital, Lily headed straight for Sophia's office, flanked by her personal guards. Alexander had made sure she was never without protection whenever she left the house.
Upon reaching Sophia's office, Lily was pleased to find her there.

“Lily!" Sophia greeted her warmly and gave her a hug.

They embraced briefly before sitting down.

“What a nice surprise!" Sophia remarked. The two had become closer after a gathering that Alexander and Lily hosted following a recent court case,but they hadn't seen each other since.

Sophia's smile faded when she noticed how pale Lily looked. “You don't look well. What's wrong?”

"That's why I'm here," Lily admitted.

"Please, sit down." Sophia said, guiding her to the couch.“What's going on? You don't look yourself."

"I've been feeling nauseous, weak, and dizzy for a while now." Lily explained.

"Could you be pregnant?” Sophia asked with a hopeful smile.

“I came to find that out," Lily responded.

Sophia nodded,“Let's start with a pregnancy test then."

Sophia handed Lily a pregnancy test kit, and she went to the restroom to take the test. After using it, Lily anxiously waited to see if two lines would appear,silently hoping for good news. When she finally looked, there was only one red line.

Her heart sank, and tears began to roll down her cheeks. She had been trying for another baby for three years but with no success. She and Alexander were often intimate, except when work kept one of them away.
and she had expected to get pregnant again easily. Yet, despite their efforts,nothing had happened.

Lily wiped her tears and emerged from the bathroom.

Sophia, seeing her tear-stained face, rushed over. “Did you take the test?"

Lily nodded and showed Sophia the result. Sophia immediately embraced her.

“It's okay. It'll happen in time,"Sophia reassured her.

“But when?” Lily asked,pulling away from the hug.

"You had Viola, so of course you'll have another child. You might have as many children as you wish," Sophia encouraged.

Lily sighed. “But if I'm not pregnant, what's making me feel like this?"

"That's what we're going to figure out," Sophia said, guiding her to a hospital bed. She performed several tests, and after a while,the results were ready.

"What's wrong with me?" Lily asked.

"Stress, anxiety, overthinking, and poor eating and sleeping habits," Sophia explained as she read the report. “You're not taking care of yourself properly.”

Lily sighed and nodded. “I have been feeling stressed and anxious lately.”

"You need to take better care of yourseIf, Lily," Sophia advised.

"Mmm, I'll try," Lily agreed, standing up. "I should get going. It's already after 8 PM, and Viola must be waiting for me."
"Hold on a second," Sophia said, catching her hand.

Lily paused, waiting to hear what Sophia wanted to say.

“Please, don't let this weigh too heavily on your mind," Sophia urged.

Lily nodded, grabbed her things, and headed out. Her guards had been waiting for her outside the hospital for hours. Sophia walked her to the elevator,sensing how down Lily felt.


As they made their way to the underground parking garage, Ariana arrived at the hospital with her mother, Carolina, and her own bodyguards.

“Really, Ariana, you didn't need to drag me to the hospital. I just caught a cold last night," her mother protested.

“Relax, Mom,” Ariana smirked. She had been looking for a reason to visit this hospital, owned by Richard, a friend of Alexander's. She knew Alexander often brought Lily here, and now she had an excuse to come more often by registering her mother as a patient.

As Ariana and her mother approached one of the elevators, Lily and her guards steppoed out of another elevator across the garage. Sophia was walking with her toward their car. Ariana's eyes lit up as she spotted Lily.

"Samson,"she called to her bodyguard.

“Yes,Ma'am?”

"Take my mother upstairs first," Ariana instructed.

“Alright,Ma'am.”

Her mother, realizing what Ariana was up to, sighed in frustration. "Let's just go, Ariana. Stop making trouble."
"I'm not causing trouble, Mom. I just want to say hello," Ariana smiled.

Carolina shook her head,following Samson into the elevator.

Ariana approached Lily. "Mrs. Kane!" she called out.

Lily turned toward the voice and frowned when she saw Ariana approaching.

Ariana stepped in front of her. “Hey, Lily! I haven't seen you since you were released from prison. I'm so happy you're free now. I just wanted to let you know I was one of the people who believed in your innocence. I also want to apologize on behalf of my assistant Jamila for what she did to you. Who could have guessed someone so innocent-looking could do such a horrible thing?”

She placed a hand on her chest as if genuinely shocked.

“I had no idea Jamila held such hatred toward you. Who knows what she might have been hiding from me as well?” Ariana added dramatically.

Sophia and Lily exchanged a knowing glance. Sophia felt like saying something to Ariana but held back, allowing Lily to deal with her instead.

Lily took a step closer to Ariana and slapped her across the face.

The force of the slap left Ariana staggered and speechless. She instinctively clutched her burning cheek, now red from the blow.

Ariana glanced around the empty garage. It was already late, and no one else was around to witness the slap. She wished someone had seen it and recorded a video so she could use it to her advantage. But Lily had chosen the perfect time and place to confront her.
"Alexander told me everything you tried to pull when he was vulnerable.How dare you!" Lily's voice was sharp with anger.

Sophia's eyes widened in surprise. She hadn't realized Ariana had stooped so low. Even Ariana herself was shocked that Alexander had confided in Lily.

"Oh, you didn't think I'd find out, didI you? Alexander told me everything the very next day-how he threw you out of our estate. You're a shameless woman, Ariana. You're 33 years old,yet you act without any dignity!”

Lily grabbed Ariana's wrist with all her strength. “Let me make this clear:stay away from our lives. If you try to come between me and Alexander again, I will end you. And I mean it," she warned, her eyes cold and threatening.

Once she was sure her message had sunk in, Lily released Ariana, who almost fell from the sudden movement.

Lily climbed into her car and drove away. Sophia, seeing Ariana still standing there in shock, entered the elevator without saying a word.

Fuming with anger, Ariana's thoughts raced. It wasn't the slap that infuriated her the most-it was the fact that Alexander had shared everything with Lily. Their unity, that they shared everything, drove her mad.

But that would end soon, she promised herself. As Ariana glared after Lily,she murmured under her breath, "It seems the only way to defeat you is to get rid of you. Let's see who eliminates who first."
###Chapter 122

When Lily got home, she was surprised to see James leaving the house. If James, Alexander's assistant, was here, that could only mean one thing-Alexander had returned.


"Good evening, ma'am," James greeted her politely.

"Is he back?"

"Yes,ma'am."

"And he wasn't pleased to not find you at home."

Lily's heart raced. How would she explain that she had gone to the hospital for a checkup? She had no idea what Clara might have told him,but she knew he would ask her questions.

"Good night,ma'am."

"Good night,James."

James quickly left, not wanting to be called back by his boss. He had been working non-stop for two weeks, and finally, Alexander had given him the day off tomnorrow.

Lily walked into the house,only to see Clara coming down the stairs.

"Oh,ma'am, you're finally home," Clara sighed with relief.


"Yes, did he ask you anything?"

"Yes,ma'am."

"And what did you say?"
"I told him you went to the hospital to visit Sophia."

Lily nodded. "That's good."

"What did the doctor say, ma'am?" Clara asked with genuine concern for her health.


"It's just stress and not eating properly."

"That's it?" Clara seemed to be expecting different news.

Lily noticed Clara was hoping she'd be pregnant. Lily nodded,sensing Clara's anticipation.

"Let me know if you need anything,ma'am," Clara offered.

"You can call it a night,Clara."

"Alright, ma'am. Good night."

Lily made her way upstairs to their room. Not finding Alexander there.she figured he was in his study. She freshened up in the bathroom,changed into her nightwear, and then headed to the study.

She knocked on the door and waited.

"Since when do you knock?" came Alexander's voice.

Lily pushed open the door and stepped in.

Alexander's eyes scanned her from top to bottom. She was wearing a short nightgown that revealed her legs.

Lily walked over and sat on his lap, planting a kiss on his lips before resting her head on his chest.′′Imissed you."
Whatever anger Alexander had vanished instantly. He wrapped his arms around her waist and kissed her cheek. "Where did you go?"

"To the hospital."

"You're not feeling well?" he asked, concerned.


He looked at her closely and noticed how pale she appeared. He placed his hand on her forehead-it felt warm. "You've got a fever."

Lily nodded.

"Why didn't you tell me?"

"I didn't want to worry you while you were busy with work," she explained softly.

Her words made him frown. "Since when do you hide things from me?Even if I'm away, you can always call. Unless there's more you're not telling me," he said suspiciously.

Lily looked away, avoiding his gaze.

Her reaction only confirmed his suspicions. He gently turned her chin so she would face him. "Tell me everything. Don't leave anything out," he warned.

Lily bit her lip before confessing,′′Ithought I might be pregnant. The symptoms felt like it, but it turned out I was just sick."

Her voice wavered as she spoke. She had hoped to keep it from him,but she knew he'd find out eventually.

"My love," Alexander said softly, resting her head on his chest and rubbing her back comfortingly.
He wasn't concerned about having another child, but he knew how much she longed for it.

"I'm not worried about that, love. You and Viola are everything to me.If we have another child, great. If no, that's fine too."

Lily looked up at him, recognizing the sincerity in his words. While he wasn't bothered, she still longed to give him more children.

He wiped away her tears and kissed her. "Please stop crying."

She nodded and rested against his chest again.

The following day, Alexander decided not to go to work. He stayed home to care for Lily since she wasn't feeling well and to spend time with their daughter.

Meanwhile, in a different part of the city, Ariana got dressed and left the house with her bodyguard, Samson, without her mother's knowledge.After the humiliation Lily had put her through the previous day, it was time to take action.

Sitting in the backseat of the car, she stared out the window, lost in thought. Memories of her past with Alexander flashed in her mind-back when she had been the love of his life. Their relationship had made others envious,and she remembered the affection he showered on her.

Ariana knew that the one thing Alexander despised most was betrayal,thanks to what his mother had done to his father. That's why, when she betrayed him, she was certain he'd stop loving her. After her betrayal, she had triedI to flee from him, only to end up in an accident that nearly claimed her life.

When she finally woke from her coma, all she wanted was to be with
Alexander again. Even though he hated her now, she believed he would eventually love her again-if only she could remove Lily from the picture.To make that happen, she had decided to visit the one person who hated Lily even more than she did.

Smiling at her plan, Ariana arrived at the country's most secure prison after hours of driving. It wasn't surprising that Lily had placed her stepmother, Bella, in this heavily guarded facility. Lily must have feared Bella could easily escape otherwise, so she'd ensured the highest level of security.

Stepping out of the car, Ariana stared at the towering prison walls lined with sharp metal spikes.

"Wait here for me. Samson. I won't be long."

"But ma'am, what if they find out you're here?" Samson asked, clearly worried. He knew how powerful Alexander and Lily were, and Ariana's actions could backfire.

"Don't worry. I've handled everything. Just wait for me," she said, walking towards the entrance.

Ariana had arranged this visit in advance, bribing key officials to ensure she could meet Bella without detection.

Lily and Alexander had not only confined Bella to this prison, but they had also forbidden anyone from visiting her. Every move Bella made was closely monitored by Alexander's people. However, Ariana had paid a hefty sum to the prison's chief to bypass these restrictions.

In order to avoid being seen by Alexander's watchers, the visit would take place in a secret location within the prison.
Ariana was escorted to a small, hidden room where Bella would meet her in private. She sat in a chair and waited for Bella to arrive.


Bella was taken aback when she learned she had a visitor. She feared it might be Alexander or Lily, as they were the only ones who ever came to see her. But when the prison chief hinted that the visitor could be of help to her, Bella became curious.

She had no idea who it could be, but she was eager to find out.

Bella was led to a part of the prison she had never seen before. A door opened, and inside stood a woman with long brunette hair, her back to the door as she looked out the window.

As Bella entered. the door shut behind her.

Ariana turned around, her eyes widening at the sight before her.The woman standing in front of her looked nothing like the pictures she had seen. The Bella in those photos had been a vibrant, middle-aged woman.But the person before her now looked old and haggard.

Her hair, once long, was now short, and her appearance was almost frightening.

"Wow, your stepdaughter really did a number on you. She turned you into an old hag. How could you let her do this to you?"

Bella, unsure of who this woman was, asked,"Who...are you?"

Ariana smirked, stepping closer but keeping her distance. "I'm your savior.
###Chapter 123

"I am your rescuer."


Bella studied the young woman once more, noticing how her attire screamed wealth, and the way she carried herself hinted at a life of privilege. But who was she?

"What do you mean you're my rescuer? What are you saving me from?"Bella asked with genuine curiosity.


Ariana let out a loud; carefree laugh, leaving Bella more puzzled. "Did you really just ask what I'm saving you from?" she said, glancing at Bella from top to bottom. "Have you forgotten that you're stuck in this so-called modern prison?"

"And you think you can save me from it?" Bella questioned.

"Yes, I can. If I couldn't, I wouldn't be here." Ariana sat dowwn,crossing her legs. "Take a seat."

Bella glanced at her and then the chair before finally sitting down.

"Before you continue, I've been wondering how you even got in to see me.No one's been allowed to visit me for a long time. Did Lily or Alexander send you?" Bella inquired, knowing that ever since her daughter's death two years ago, Alexander had banned any visitors.

Not only that, Alexander had prevented her from taking her own life. His grief had been unbearable ever since their daughter's death sentence.

Ariana smiled in response. "No, they didn't send me. But they're the reason I'm here."
Bella frowned in confusion. "Why are you here?"

"Good question. I'm here because I need your help. I want us to team up."

"What could you possibly need my help for? Can't you see I'm locked away here for life?" Bella replied, emphasizing the "modern prison" phrase that Ariana had used earlier.

Ariana smirked. "That's why I said I'm your rescuer. I can help you get out of here, and in return, you'll help me deal with your stepdaughter-the one who killed your daughter."

Bella began to realize that the woman sitting across from her was one of Lily's enemies. It didn't surprise her; Lily, being married to one of the richest men in the world and the heir to the Blake empire, was bound to have plenty of enemies. But Bella wanted to know why this woman wanted Lily dead.

"I see. So tell me,why do you want to kill Lily?"

Ariana leaned back in her chair, ready to reveal her identity and motivations. "I was Alexander's first love, but I betrayed him, and he's hated me ever since. Everyone believed I was dead, even I thought I was dead. But I woke up from a coma after years, and all I could think about was getting Alexander back. When I found out he was married to your stepdaughter, and they had a child together, I started planning. Right now.I'm pretending to have lost my memory, but Lily's too clever to believe me,and I'm struggling to remnove her from the picture. That's why I need your help. You've already taken out her mother and two sisters, so you can help me finish her off."

Bella studied the seemingly innocent young woman in front of her. She talked like someone who had lost her grip on reality. The two of them
weren't so different, except for one thing-this girl was even more unhinged.

Bella had killed Lily's mother to become the only wife and her two daughters to ensure her own daughter would inherit the Blake fortune.

"I won't deny that you and I are quite similar. I did everything I could to secure my place and my daughter's future. But there's one key difference between us. Do you know what that is?" Bella asked the young woman.

Ariana smiled. "The fact that I'm crazier than you?"

Bella nodded. "Yes, you're much crazier. And here's why: I never fought for a man who didn't want me. Alexander wanted me, but he hesitated because he already had a wife. So, I removed her. But you-you're chasing after a man who despises you. After what you did, he'll never forgive you. So what's the point of fighting for something that's already lost?"

"And secondly, you know Alexander well. You know what he's capable of.And like you said, Lily is smart and ruthless. She even killed her own stepsister. What do you think she'll do to you, someone who isn't even family?" Bella laughed.

Ariana clenched her fists. "Then you'll be shocked to see just how dangerous I can be."

"Good luck with that," Bella replied.

Ariana stood, picking up her bag. "So, will you join me, or are you content to spend the rest of your miserable life here?"

Bella thought for a moment before shaking her head. "As much as I want to leave this cell, I've decided to stay. I've accepted my fate."
Ariana scoffed. "Coward."

"No, I'm not a coward. I've simply come to terms with reality. There are winners and losers in life. When things don't go your way, you have to accept that you've lost and move on. You need to learn how to accept defeat."


Bella continued, "When I succeeded in killing Lily's sisters but failed to kill her. I should've realized that I'd löst. Instead, I kept going after her,despite the risks. Look around you, Ariana. I'm in prison, not living in luxury. My being here should have made you realize that seeking my help won't lead to victoy. A loser like me can't help you win."

Branda paused, then added, "Let me give you some advice. I'm sure you have a mother or someone who cares about you."

At the mention of her mother, Ariana flinched.

"You're young and beautiful. You'll find someone who loves you. You have money, so go far away and live your life. Don't waste it fighting a battle you'll lose. Don't make the same mistakes I did. My daughter is dead because I couldn't let go. If you continue down this path, they won't spare you either. Lily is just waiting for you to make your move so she can destroy you."

Bella laughed, a wild, almost maniacal laugh that made Ariana take a step back.

"I never thought I'd be the one giving this kind of advice," Bella said through tears. "I wish I'd known better. If I had, my daughter might still be alive,"

Expecting some sympathy, Bella was instead met with a mocking smile
from Ariana. "Wow, you're not just a coward-you're a loser. I will never end up like you, and I will never lose. Watch the news,because soon,you'Il hear about Lily's death."

Bella shook her head sadly. "Good luck, then. But I hope that before you die, you'll remember that I warned you."

With that, Ariana left, still fuming. Her plan to make Bella her ally had failed.


But instead of discouraging her, the failure made Ariana more determined.In a few days, Lily would be dead.
###Chapter 124

A woman in herlate fifties stepped out from the prison gates, carrying the burden of years spent inside. As she approached the waiting car, her face showed a mix of freedom and doubt. Without exchanging any words,she got into the vehicle where an unknown person was seated, and they drove away.


The next day:

Alexander had spent the entire day with Lily and Viola, and if it weren't for work,he would have preferred another full day with them. He couldn't quite understand why Lily insisted on going to work today when she wasn't fully recovered. He watched as she dressed in a simple office outfit and frowned. Alexander strode over to her, wrapped his arms around her waist. and kissed her gently on the shoulder, making Lily smile.

"Alexander," she said softly.

"You're not completely well yet. Why don't you stay home instead of going to work?"

"I'd love to, but there's so much to do at the office. I've spent the last few days at home with Viola. It's time to get back to work," she replied.

Alexander frowned and turned her to face him, planting a kiss on her forehead.

"Fine, but please be careful. Don't meet with any strangers," he said firmly.

"Strangers?" Lily gave him a puizzled look, unable to read his expression.

"I just want you to be cautious," he repeated.
Sensing there was more he wasn't telling her, Lily decided not to push further.

"Alright. I'll be careful," she agreed.

"Good girl," he smiled, pleased with her response.

After the family of three had breakfast, Viola stood outside with her nanny,watching her parents' cars drive away. She had loved spending the entire day with them and smiled as she remembered the silly things she made them do,how they had acted like teenagers for her amusement. Viola was already looking forward to finding another opportunity to spend the whole day with them, doing more fun activities.

"Are you ready to go inside?" her nanny asked.

"Yes, I need to go in and get my books ready before my teacher arrives,"Viola replied. She had recently started homeschooling again since her parents had decided it wasn't safe for her to attend her usual public school.***


Alexander arrived at the office, where James was waiting to brief him on the day's business meetings. As James walked beside him, listing off the schedule, Alexander's mind was elsewhere. His thoughts were consumed with something else entirely. When they reached his office, Alexander sat down in his chair, and James continued talking until Alexander raised his hand to stop him.

"Sir?" James asked, his heart racing, afraid he had said something wrong.

"I'm not interested in that right now. I need you to double the security around Lily and Viola immediately," Alexander ordered.
"But, sir... we already have people watching them," James stammered.

"I want the security increased," Alexander repeated firmly.

James knew that his boss always had people discreetly monitoring his wife and daughter. Why the sudden urgency to double the security? Something must be wrong.

"Yes, sir. I'll handle it right away. But is something the matter?" James asked hesitantly.

Alexander gave him. a stern look, making James immediatelyregret his question. "I'll get it done," he said quickly and left the room.

Alexander didn't want Lily and that woman crossing paths. He was certain she would try to see Lily before leaving the country, especially since the condition he had set for her release was that she would leave and never return.


***

At Blake Enterprises, Katrina placed the documents her boss needed for an upcoming meeting with investors on her desk. After her boss's legal troubles had been resolved, the company's stock hadn't just bounced back-it had tripled. Many of the investors who had pulled out were now eager to reinvest,but Mrs. Blake had refused them, opting instead to welcome fresh investors. Today, she would be meeting with some of the top candidates.

When Katrina had asked her boss why she wouldn't allow the old investors back, she explained that those individuals hadn't just withdrawn their investments-they had spoken ill of the company that had made them wealthy. "We don't need such two-faced investors," her boss had

"Are the documents ready?" Lily asked, seated at her desk.

"Yes, ma'am. You can review them now," Katrina replied.

Lily scanned through the papers, and after ensuring everything was in order, she headed to the meeting with Katrina.

Two hours later, after a successful meeting, Lily was leaving the room when someone grasped her hand. The cold touch felt oddly familiar, as though she had experienced it before. Lily turned to see a figure dressed as a janitor, the person's wrinkled hands trembling slightly. The figure lowered their face mask, and Lily's eyes widened in shock.

Angelina, Alexander's mother, stood before her. Glancing around, she saw only Katrina nearby, who appeared just as confused as Lily. Angelina quickly replaced her mask.

"Alexander has been keeping close watch on me, and I think he's doing the same to you," Angelina whispered. "But I had to take the risk to come here."

Lily had countless questions but knew this wasn't the place to ask them.Thankfully, the investors had left, and it was just the three of them in the hallway.

"Katrina," Lily said quietly.

"Yes,ma'am?"

"Take her to the safe location. I'll be there in thirty minutes."

"Understood," Katrina replied, escorting Angelina to a hidden spot known
only to her and Lily. Katrina didn't ask any questions,sensing that this older woman was someone important to her boss. She couldn't help but notice the resemblance between the woman and Lily's husband.

Once in her office, Lily paced back and forth, waiting for the thirty minutes to pass. She was struggling to understand how Angelina was out of prison. Then, she recalled Alexander's strange comment that morning about avoiding strangers. It made sense now. He had arranged for his mother's release but likely hadn't approved her seeing Lily or Viola,which explained the disguise.

Now that Lily understood the situation, her main question was why Angelina had taken such a risk to see her. As soon as the time was up,she left her office and headed to the rooftop, where she had a private room only she and Katrina had access to.

Entering the room, she closed the door behind her. "Katrina, you can leave us now," she instructed.

Katrina nodded and quietly exited.

"Now that it's just us, you can remove your mask," Lily said.

Angelina took off her face mask and headscarf, smiling at Lily. "Inever thought I'd see you again after you visited me two years ago in prison."

"I'm happy you're free after all these years," Lily replied.

"Yes, I'm free now, and I have you to thank."

"Thank me?Why?"

"Because I'm sure you said something to soften Alexander's heart,"Angelina explained.
Lily shook her head. "No, I didn't. After I tried to convince him two years ago, we never spoke of it again. So if you're free now, it's because he decided to do so on his own."

Angelina nodded slowly. "Regardless, I'm grateful. But Alexander gave me a condition."


"What condition?"

"That I leave the country and never come back. My flight is at 11 PM tonight, but before I go, I want to see Viola-if only for a moment,even from afar. I've seen pictures of her in magazines, but I want to see her in real life before I leave."
###Chapter 125

Angelina's words deeply moved Lily. If she were in her position, she would do everything possible to ensure she saw her grandchild one last time.


"I already have so many regrets. I don't want missing out on seeing my grandchild to be another one," Angelina said with a heavy heart.

Lily nodded. “I'll make sure you meet her. I'll introduce you."

“Thank you." Angelina whispered, her eyes welling up with tears. She embraced Lily tightly. “Thank you so much.”

Lily hugged her back,gently reassuring her.“It's alright."

Angelina pulled back, still worried. “But won't Alexander be upset? If Viola sees me, she might tell her father she met her grandmother.”Angelina's worry was clear.

Lily sighed.“Yes, she probably will."

"Then don't introduce me. I'll just watch her from a distance. I don't want to cause any trouble between you and Alexander because of me."Angelina insisted, her voice trembling.

"Don't worry about it," Lily assured her. "I'll handle it.”

Angelina looked anxious for Lily's sake. "Thank you, Lily. You were truly meant to be with Alexander. Nothing will tear you two apart, not even someone like me," she said sincerely, believing her son had made the best choice in Lily.

Lily didn't respond with words, but her nod expressed agreement,and
soon they were on their way to meet Viola.

To make sure Alexander didn't find out immediately, Lily waited until lunchtime. She quickly called Clara and asked Viola's nanny to bring her to a restaurant where they would have lunch. Lily left the office in one car,while her driver, Pedro, was instructed to bring Angelina in another vehicle.

Lily knew Alexander would eventually find out, but by the time he did.Angelina would have already seen Viola. Alexander probably already had people telling him that Viola was going to lunch with her mother, but he didn't know his mother would be there too.

Lily waited in the private room she had reserved, her heart pounding. She felt guilty, like a rebellious wife defying her husband. She knew Alexander would be furious, but she planned to explain and ask for forgiveness later.

Soon.the door opened, and Viola rushed in excitedly. “Mommy!”she exclaimed, running into her mother's arms.

Lily kissed her daughter's cheek and stroked her long hair lovingly. Viola snuggled into her, and Lily smiled at her affection. Even at five years old,Viola still enjoyed moments of closeness, and this was one of those times.

"When is the food coming, Mommy? I'm hungry," Viola asked eagerly.

"Soon, baby. We're waiting for one more person," Lily replied.

Viola's eyes brightened with curiosity."Is Daddy coming?!"

Lily shook her head. "No, it's not Daddy. But someone you've been wanting to meet."

"Who is it?" Viola asked, her curiosity piqued.
"Look at the door," Lily suggested with a smile.

Viola turned toward the door just as it opened, revealing an elderly woman who looked a lot like her father. The woman smiled warmly,and Viola couldn't help but smile back.

Angelina approached the table, her heart full as she gazed at her granddaughter. Overcome with emotion, tears filled her eyes. Viola,sensing the importance of the moment, climbed down from her mother's lap and walked over to hug the woman.

Angelina was surprised but hugged Viola back tightly, soaking in the moment. Her tears continued to fall, and she tried to stop them, but they kept coming.

"Why are you crying?" Viola asked softly, wiping Angelina's cheeks with her small hands.

“Because I'm so happy to finally see you," Angelina said, her voice trembling as she embraced her granddaughter again.

Lily watched them with a smile.

"Are you Daddy's mom?" Viola asked, catching both Lily and Angelina off guard.

Angelina turned to Lily, surprised she hadn't said anything yet. Lily shook her head slightly, indicating that she hadn't mentioned it to Viola.

"How do you know that?" Angelina asked, curious.

Viola beamed.“Because you look like Daddy! My mom and teacher said when people look alike, they're family."
Angelina smiled warmly. "Yes, your mom and teacher are right."

"So,you're my grandma?" Viola asked excitedly.

Angelina nodded, tears flowing as Viola jumped up and hugged her tightly.“Grandma!”

Viola had always wanted a big, happy family, and meeting her grandmother made her overjoyed. But soon, her curiosity got the better of her. "Why haven't you been in our lives?" she asked innocently.

Both Lily and Angelina froze at the question, unsure of how to answer.

"And why hasn't Daddy told me about you?" Viola added, waiting for an explanation.

Sensing Angelina's hesitation, Lily quickly stepped in.“Grandma has been far away, sweetheart. Daddy didn't tell you because we weren't sure when she would be able to come back."

Viola nodded thoughtfully."Really,Mommy?”

“Yes,baby. You should enjoy this time with Grandma because she might have to leave again after today," Lily gently warned her.

"Why does she 'have to leave?”Viola asked,pouting.

Angelina smiled tenderly and stroked Viola's hair. "You're still young.Viola. There are things you won't understand right now. But when you're older,everything will make sense."

Viola nodded again, used to that response from her mother whenever she asked about adult matters. Content with the answer, she decided to enjoy her time with her grandmother.
The three of them ordered lunch and spent the afternoon talking, with Viola learning more about her grandmother. It was a special moment for all of them.

When lunch ended, however, Viola didn't want to say goodbye. She clung to her grandmother. “Mommy, can't I spend more time with Grandma?"

“Viola, it's time to go," Lily gently reminded her.

"No, Mommy!" Viola pleaded. "I want to take Grandma to my favorite place in the city!"

Lily hesitated. She knew Alexander would be upset if he found out. But Viola's hopeful expression tugged at her heart.

“Baby,we can't. You need to go home, and I have to return to work,"Lily explained.

Even Angelina urged Viola to listen, but the little girl refused to give up.In the end. Lily gave in. But now she worried about how they would leave without Alexander discovering their secret lunch.

To avoid suspicion, she considered having them leave in separate cars,but Viola insisted they all ride together. Eventually, Lily relented, and the three of them left in the same SUV. Viola was thrilled to be taking her grandmother to her favorite spot.

Unknown to them, Alexander's men had already informed him of the situation, and he was furious. He had sent more security to monitor them.but he couldn't shake the bad feeling he had.

As their SUV drove along the highway, two large trucks suddenly veered into their lane, heading straight for them. Viola, noticing the trucks,asked.“Mommy, why are those trucks coming toward us?"
Lily's heart pounded with fear. Pedro, their driver, tried to steer the car to safety, but another truck appeared, blocking their path.

Sensing the danger, Lily instinctively shielded Viola with her body. In the split second before the collision, she felt another body cover both her and her daughter-Angelina.

The crash was violent and chaotic, with the sound of metal crushing and glass shattering. Their SUV flipped and skidded to a halt, upside down.

Through the haze of pain and confusion, Lily realized that Angelina had thrown herself over her and Viola, protecting them. Tears filled Lily's eyes as she saw her mother-in-law's lifeless body shielding them both.

Gunfire erupted around them, and footsteps approached the wreckage.Before Lily could process what was happening, everything went black.

They had been attacked.
###Chapter 126

The day before the accident. Ariana was busy moving items fromher suitcase into her luggage.

Her mother, Carolina, entered the room and immediately questioned her."Why are you packing? Where do you think you're going,young lady?"

“It's for a work trip," Ariana replied without looking up.

"What work trip?" Carolina demanded. As a company executive,she was well aware of all business activities.

"If you don't believe me, feel free to ask my secretary,” Ariana responded.still focused on packing.

Carolina pressed further.“Where are you headed to?"

Frustrated, Ariana paused, turned to her mother, and repeated, “I just told you. I'm going on a business trip!"

"To where?” Carolina asked again.

"Mother, if you're so curious, ask my secretary! I'm tired of explaining this to you.”

“You're not even supposed to be going on this trip. One of your subordinates was assigned to it. So why are you going in their place?"Carolina wasn't backing down.

"Why do you care so much, Mother?” Ariana shot back.

Carolina's voice softened, but her concern was clear. "I care because I know you. You've been up to a lot lately, and I'm worried this is just
another one of your schemes."

Ariana stopped packing again, this time more composed. "I'm not scheming anymore, Mother. I've decided to let Alexander and Lilly be. I'm hurt, and this trip is my way of moving forward. Isn't that what you've always wanted? Now, please, can I finish packing in peace?"

Carolina, feeling somewhat reassured, nodded and left the room. If Ariana truly intended to move on, Carolina thought it best to leave her be.

Once her bags were packed, Ariana dressed and headed to the airport.Soon, she was on her way to Europe. But the moment she landed the next day,she made a call to her associates back in her home country.

"I don't care how you make it happen, but I want Lilly dead in an accident. Find any opportunity,” Ariana instructed coldly.

The leader of the group responded immediately.“Understood,ma'am."

As she hung up, Ariana muttered under her breath,"I'm sorry, Mother.but I haven't moved on.”

A few hours later, having settled into her European residence, her phone rang again. It was the gang leader with an update.

"Ma'am,we've found the perfect chance,"he reported.

Ariana's eyes gleamed with satisfaction. “Already?" She hadn't expected such swift progress.

"Yes, ma'am. Right now, Lilly is getting into an SUV with her daughter and another woman. We'll be killing two birds with one stone,"the gang leader said, grinning at the prospect.
Ariana's smile grew wider. "Good. I don't care how many guards are with her, make sure the trucks hit them hard. If they survive the crash, finish them off. And don't expect the rest of your payment unless the job is done.



"Don't worry, ma'am. We'll handle it" the leader assured her.

Ending the call. Ariana grinned. "In a few days, I'll be back for your funeral,Lilly."

Everything was proceeding according to herplan, carefully crafted in just 48 hours. There was no way this could fail.

As the gang carried out her orders, the impact of the crash was devastating.Their vehicles collided with the SUV so violently that it flipped over. Two of the gang members stepped out with guns, ready to finish off the survivors. But before they could act, gunshots rang out from the SUV's security team. Realizing they were outnumbered, the attackers retreated and fled in a nearby getaway car.

Some of the guards chased after the attackers, while others rushed to the wreckage to save Lilly, her daughter, and the other woman.

Meanwhile, Alexander, Lilly's husband, received the news at work. The shock almost caused him to collapse, but his assistant caught him. Shoving the man aside, Alexander bolted from the office and sped to the hospital where his wife and daughter had been taken.

The whole city was gripped by the news of the crash. Crowds gathered to watch live reports, while Ariana, from her distant location, sat watching the same reports, pleased with herself.

"What I want to hear now is that you and your child are dead, Lilly,”she
muttered as the broadcast continued. She had orchestrated the whole thing so carefully that no one would suspect her involvement.

Ten hours passed.


Outside the hospital, reporters swarmed, eager for any updates on the survivors of the horrific accident. The headline read:"Alexander Kane's Wife and Child Involved in a Tragic Crash."


Inside the VIP intensive care unit, Lilly's family and friends waited anxiously. Caleb, a close family friend, stood near the ICU window,looking in at the bandaged figure lying on the hospital bed-Lilly. The crash had left her severely injured, hooked up to machines that were keeping her alive. Alexander sat beside her, his expression unreadable,his emotions buried.


Caleb observed Alexander and couldn't tell what was going through his mind, but he knew the accident had deeply affected him.

Staring at his mother, Alexander muttered, “You never listen. I told you to leave the country once you were released from prison, but you refused.And now look where your stubbornness has gotten you."

His voice hardened. "I wasn't going to let you see Viola, not until I decided the time was right. But now...”

Alexander's anger boiled over, and after sitting there for a while, he got up and left the room. Outside, Caleb, still by the window, spoke to him.

"If it weren't for your mother, your wife and daughter wouldn't have survived. She shielded them in the crash."

Alexander said nothing, his face a mask.
Caleb continued, “When they brought her in, I didn't think she'd survive,but she's still breathing. When she wakes up, you should consider giving her a second chance. She deserves it." With that, Caleb walked away.relieved that Lilly and Viola had been spared.


Alexander was lost in thought when Ethan, one of his men, rushed up.breathless.


"What's wrong?" Alexander asked.

"There's good news and bad news. Which do you want first?” Ethan asked nervously.

Alexander glared.“Speak.”

Ethan quickly responded,“The bad news is the attackers were captured.but they took poison and died before we could interrogate them.”

Alexander clenched his fists."And the good news?”

"The good news is we've tracked down the leader of the gang. We'll have him soon, and he should know who ordered the hit."

Alexander's expression remained icy. "Then why are you still here?"

Ethan stammered,"I...I came to report-”

“Don't show your face to me again until you've caught him," Alexander snapped.

Ethan nodded and hurried away, determined not to return empty-handed.
###Chapter 127

Mrs. Martins was watching the news about the accident when her thoughts immediately turned to her daughter. Ariana. However,she quickly dismissed the idea thatit could be her, as Ariana wasn't in the country at the moment. To ease her mind, she called Ariana's new assistant, whom she had personally hired to keep her updated on her daughter's activities.

When the assistant picked up, Mrs. Martins got straight to the point,“Tell me everything my daughter has been doing since she arrived at her destination."


She suspected only Ariana would be reckless enough to do something like this.Even though Ariana had told her she had moved on,Mrs. Martins still had doubts.

The assistant assured her that Ariana had been completely focused on work since arriving in Europe.

Feeling reassured, Mrs. Martins concluded the incident must have been the work of another of the Kane or Blake family's enemies.

After the call, the assistant informed Ariana about the conversation.

"Was that my mother?" Ariana asked.

"Yes, ma'am," replied the assistant.

"Did she ask the usual questions?"

"Exactly as you predicted."

Ariana smiled knowingly. She had anticipated her mother's call. She was
also aware that her mother had selected this assistant to spy on her.However, what Mrs. Martins didn't know was that the assistant was loyal to Ariana and even handled her dirty work without question.

Her mother thought she was outsmarting her, but Ariana had been ahead of her all along. Everything was going according to plan, except for one unexpected detail: the elderly woman reported to be in the SUV during the accident. Who was she? If it hadn't been for that woman, Ariana was certain Lilly and her daughter would be gone by now, and she would be celebrating.

The media had yet to report on whether the woman was alive or dead,or the condition of Lilly and Viola, but Ariana knew they weren't dead yet-if they were, the news would have been everywhere by now. Still, she hoped they were in a critical state.

If it weren't for the number of cars escorting Lilly's SUV, her gang would have completed the job. But Ariana was determined to finish what she had started.


“Angela! Angela! Please don't leave me! Stay with me!" Lilly sobbed,clinging to Angela. Her hands trembled as they became soaked with blood."Angela!"she screamed, as the woman lost consciousness. Desperately,Lilly cried out for her to wake up.

In a hospital room, Lilly's body lay restless. Sarah, sitting beside her.noticed her muttering Angela's name and shedding tears while unconscious.

"Lilly, wake up. It's just a dream," Sarah said softly,trying to rouse her.
Lilly finally opened her eyes and looked around the sterile, white room.Seeing the IV in her hand, she slowly began to recall the accident. The memories came flooding back, and she clenched her fists tightly,prompting Sarah to gently wipe away the sweat from her brow.

"You're going to hurt yourself if you keep doing that," Sarah said gently,her voice filled with concern.


Hearing Sarah's voice brought Lilly back to reality. She turned her head and saw the worry on her friend's face. Sarah was visibly relieved.“Thank goodness you're awake. We were all so worried," Sarah said, hugging her and kissing her forehead, much like a mother would.

Lilly's firstquestion was immediate,"Where's Angela?"

Sarah forced a smile, trying to hide her concern. Lilly had asked about Angela first because she had protected them during the crash, minimizing the impact.

"Is she okay?" Lilly pressed when Sarah hesitated to respond.

Sarah sighed, unable to lie. “She's in critical condition.”

Tears welled up in Lilly's eyes. "How bad is it?” she asked,gripping Sarah's hand tightly.

“The doctors say her chances of survival are slim. She's still in a coma."

Lilly's worst fears were confirmed. "I need to see her. Take me to her now.



Sarah gently stopped her from trying to get up. "You can see her, but not right now. You need to rest, and the doctors need to check on you first."
Lilly didn't argue, knowing Sarah wouldn't let her leave until the doctors had cleared her.


"Where's Viola? Why isn't she in here with me?" Lilly asked, noticing her daughter wasn't in the room.


"She was here earlier, but Alexander moved her to the room across the hall.He's with her right now." Sarah explained.


Lilly nodded, understanding why Alexander had done that. He wouldn't want Viola to see her mother in such a state, especially when she hadn't woken up until now. Lilly's left arm was heavily bandaged, and she wouldn't want her daughter to witness that.

After the doctors checked on her and she rested, several visitors came to see her, including Grandma Helen, Sandra, her father, and her grandfather.Sandra spent the most time with her,even bringing Viola to see her. Lilly felt a huge sense of relief seeing that her daughter was unharmed,with only a few fading scratches.

It had been two days since Lilly had woken up, and everyone-Jacob,Michael, and others-had visited her. But Alexander had not, and it broke her heart.

Sarah, sitting nearby, could sense Lilly's sadness. Everyone knew Alexander hadn't visited, and it was well known that he had been upset with her before the accident.

Sarah had even asked Anthony to talk to Alexander, hoping his friend could convince him to visit. She reassured Lilly, "Don't worry. He'll come.He's angry, but there's no way he'll stay mad at you for long."

Lilly gave a small, sad smile. "I know him better than anyone. It's been a
week since the accident, and he's still angry, even though Viola and I survived. It shows he's not going to let this go until he feels like I've paid for my mistake. If I had just listened to him, none of this would've happened. Angela wouldn't be in critical condition, and Viola wouldn't have gone through this trauma."


Lilly's eyes filled with sadness. “Angela should've been in another country by now, starting a new life. Viola wouildn't have had to endure this. First it was Kate, and now Ariana, trying to tear Alexander away from me."


Sarah tried to console her. “One thing I know for sure is that Alexander loves you more than anything in this world. You should've seen how distraught he was when he saw your injuries. He's just angry, but I know you two will get through this. And whoever is responsible for this-whether it's Ariana or someone else-they will face the consequences."
###Chapter 128

Sarah wished she could understand what was going through Lily's mind at that moment. Lily simply watched Sarah in silence as she spoke.

"I think I've rested enough. I need to go see Angela." Lily finally said.

Sarah nodded and helped her out of bed, holding the IV stand steady. She opened the door, and together they walked out of the room. Sarah guided Lily to the VIP section of the ICU. The moment Lily saw Angela through the glass, tears immediately began to stream down her face. It was heartbreaking to see Angela in such a critical state.

Angela was on full life support, and if it were removed, she wouldn't survive more than a few moments. Lily placed her hand on the glass.allowing her tears to fall. "I'm so sorry, Angela. This is all my fault. But don't worry, whoever is responsible for this will pay for it.

"If it's who I think it is, I swear I'll deal with her myself," Lily whispered.her voice trembling with anger. She had already set a trap for Ariana, and if she was behind this, Lily wasready to finish her off.

"I promise you, Angela, whoever did this will suffer. Just get better." Lily added. She wanted to go inside and speak to Angela, but knew she couldn't because of her own health condition.

"You look terrifying right now," Sarah admitted, noticing the anger and fury etched across Lily's face.

Lily turned to Sarah. "I need you to call Jacob for me."

Sensing that Lily might be planning something drastic. Sarah quickly tried to dissuade her.
"Alexander is already handling everything. Why not focus on getting better?"


"No,let him do what he needs to, but I have my own plans. And listen carefully, you're not to tell Alexander or anyone else, including Anthony."

Sarah sighed. "You're warning me, and I don't even know what your plan is."


"You'll find out soon enough. But for now, promise me you won't say a word."


"I promise," Sarah reluctantly agreed.

"Thank you, Sarah." Lily whispered.

Meanwhile, Alexander was at the hospital, but instead of visiting Lily, he had only gone to see their daughter. On his way out, he stopped outside Lily's door, just as he always did, but didn't enter. As much as he longed to hold her, kiss her, and thank her for surviving, his anger still burned.Her defiance had caused everything that happened.

"How is she doing?" Alexander asked one of the guards outside her room.

The guard hesitated, nervous. He had been ordered to keep Lily in her room but had failed to stop her from leaving.

"Iasked you a question," Alexander pressed, his voice growing sharp.

"She... she left with her friend, sir," the guard stammered.

"She's not fully recovered, and she's already wandering around? Where did she go?" Alexander demanded.

"To the ICU, sir... to see her friend,"the guard replied nervously.
Alexander shot him an icy glare before walking away. The guards trembled under his gaze.


After spending some time with Angela. Lily headed back to her room with Sarah. As they walked, they saw Alexander approaching. Lily's heart raced.but she kept her composure. His expression was so intense it could burn through someone's soul.

He stopped close to her, and she could smell his familiar, intoxicating scent.She longed to hug him, rest her head on his chest. She missed him terribly and craved his presence.


"Alexander..."

"Shush, I don't want to hear anything," he interrupted.

"But I-"

"Why did you leave your room?" he asked coldly.

"I went to see Angela."

"You shouldn't be leaving your room when you're still recovering," he said,glancing at her bandaged hand, his frown deepening.


′′Iknow. I'm heading back now," Lily replied softly.


Alexander watched her walk away.

"Please take care of her," he said to Sarah.

"Iwill, but only if you promise you won't let this go on forever. You two need to get back to being the loving couple you used to be," Sarah urged.

"That'll happen once she's learned her lesson," Alexander said firmly. He
was determined to find out who was responsible for the accident and see that they paid, but Lily would also face her own consequences.

"You'll suffer too," Sarah sighed.

Alexander gave her a sidelong glance before walking away. Sarah shook her head and followed Lily back to her room.

As Alexander made his way out of the hospital, he encountered Anthony by the elevator.


"There are reporters outside waiting for you. If you don't want to deal with them, we can take the underground garage," Anthony suggested.

"No, I'll talk to them," Alexander replied.

"Why? What are you planning to say?" Anthony asked, surprised.

"You asked if I wanted to speak to them, didn't you?"

"Yeah, but I didn't think you'd actually agree. So what are you going to say?" Anthony pressed.

Alexander stopped walking and turned to him. "If I don't address them,they'll keep showing up at the hospital. You know how reporters are-they won't stop until they get answers."

"Fíne, but the public's reaction won't be pleasant."

"I don't care. My priority is to make sure the reporters stop coming here."

"And you think they'll all just stop?"

"The fewer, the better. I haven't caught the person responsible yet, but whoever it is tried to kill Lily and Viola. Whoever did this will want to
finish the job, and when they try, I'll be ready to catch them in the act."

At Aurora City's International Airport. Ariana arrived with her assistant and got into a waiting car.


"Should I take you home, ma'am?" the assistant asked.

"No, head to Bright Hospital," Ariana replied with a smile.She needed to see for herself whether Lily had survived.


Back in Lily's VIP room at the hospital, she received a call. "She's in the country now?" the caller asked.

"Yes, and she's heading to the hospital as we speak," Lily confirmed before hanging up. She was ready to see what Ariana would do, knowing her plan to kill her had failed.

Lily had already spoken to Jacob, and it was confirmed that Ariana was responsible for the attack. There was evidence, but Lily wasn't ready to hand it over to Alexander just yet. She wanted to deal with Ariana herself.
###Chapter 129

Anthony attempted to persuade Alexander to reconsider, but Alexander remained firm, so Anthony simply followed him. Stepping out of the hospital. Alexander was greeted by a massive crowd of reporters, all eager to catch a glimpse of anyone from the Kane or Blake families. They were desperate for any update on the family members involved in the recent accident.


As soon as they saw Alexander, the reporters surged forward,each competing to be the first to ask a question. Alexander's security team quickly intervened, holding the reporters back and pushing them away from him. Despite being restrained, the reporters continued shouting their questions, filling the air with a chaotic din. Anthony felt irritated by the clamor,but Alexander remained composed, unfazed by the noise.

"SIR.CAN YOU UPDATE US ON THE CURRENT CONDITION OF YOUR WIFE AND CHILD?" one reporter shouted above the crowd.


"MR. KANE, CAN YOU ALSO TELL US WHO THE OLDER WOMAN WAS WHO WAS WITH YOUR FAMILY IN THE CAR?" another reporter asked.


That question made the others pause, realizing they had been wondering the same thing. They eagerly prepared their cameras to capture Alexander's response.

Alexander scanned the crowd with his eyes before speaking. The cameras zoomed in on him as the reporters hung on his every word.

"Since you're all curious about the woman who risked her life for my wife and daughter, I'll tell you wvho she is," Alexander began, his voice calm but commanding.
The reporters leaned in, waiting for him to reveal her identity.

"Angela Kane," he stated.

The reporters exchanged puzzled glances, trying to recall the name,but it didn't ring any bells.


"WHO IS ANGELA KANE?" a reporter asked aloud, voicing the confusion shared by the others.


The question lingered in the air, but Alexander offered no further explanation. People. watching the news broadcast also wondered who Angela Kane was, as her name wasn't familiar to anyone, even though the public knew every member of the Kane family.


"As for my wife and child, they are both doing fine," Alexander added before turning to leave. He walked toward the waiting car, flanked by his security team.

The reporters continued shouting questions, but Alexander didn't answer any of them. He got into the vehicle with Anthony, and their driver quickly pulled away from the hospital.

"You've given them a puzzle to solve. Now, they'll have to dig into her past, a past you've tried to keep buried for years. Wouldn't it have been easier to just explain everything? After all, you were the one who chose to talk to them," Anthony commented, glancing at Alexander.

Alexander shot him a look but said nothing.

Meanwhile, Ariana had been watching the entire exchange from a distance.She had overheard everything Alexander said. Ariana knew exactly who Angela was, and she was shocked to learn that Angela was no longer in prison. More importantly, she was surprised to discover that Angela had
been with Lily and Viola in the SUV during the accident.

"This just got interesting," Ariana thought to herself.

"What do you plan to do with this new information.ma'am?"Samson,her assistant,asked, curious as always since he rarely knew her full intentions.

"Nothing changes. Everything is still going according to plan. She's not a threat." Ariana replied dismissively.

"Alright, ma'am. But are you still going inside the hospital now that you've learned this?"


Ariana gave him a condescending look. "Of course, I'm going in. Don't forget. I camehere for a checkup," she said with a smirk before heading inside the hospital.

Samson sighed but followed her, knowing full well that her checkup wasn't her true purpose.

Inside Lily's VIP room, she was already prepared. She knew Ariana was in the hospital and wouldn't be able to resist coming to see her condition firsthand. There's an old saying that the person who tried to kill you will always come back to see the result.

That's exactly what Ariana intended to do. Even though she might have heard that Lily had survived, she still needed to see it for herself. Lily had instructed Sarah to leave the room when Ariana arrived. Although Sarah initially refused, furious that Ariana had the audacity to visit after everything she had done, Lily eventually convinced her it was necessary.

After finishing her fake checkup, Ariana couldn't resist going to the floor where Lily's room was. She ignored Samson's warnings that it might raise suspicion and pressed on.
Arriving on the 10th floor, where Lily was staying, Ariana walked slowly down the halI until she reached Lily's room. Lily had arranged for no guards to be at her door when Ariana came, allowing her to enter freely.Ariana knew which room it was thanks to the news coverage. It seemed Alexander suspected that whoever caused the accident might return to finish the job.


Though Ariana wasn't foolish enough to attempt anything in the hospital,she had another plan in mind. All she wanted now was to face Lily and send her a clear message-the battle was far from over.

Ariana knew how powerful Alexander was, and she was fully aware that if he found out she had visited Lily, especially to have the conversation she was about to have, he would likely take her to one of his hidden facilities for interrogation, possibly even torture her. But she had a backup plan to ensure that wouldn't happen.

Ariana calmly knocked on the door, turned the knob, and stepped inside.The first thing she saw was Lily, seated on a couch, sipping coffee. The room was as large and luxurious as a presidential suite, filling Ariana with envy.

She closed the door and walked further inside. Lily looked relaxed and comfortable, her only visible injury being a bandaged left hand.Her face was flawless, which irritated Ariana. If Lily had survived, the least she could have hoped for was some permanent disfigurement, but instead, it seemed like Lily had barely been touched by the accident.

"You came to see if I was still alive?" Lily asked coolly.

Aríana's initial frown shifted into a smile.111just wanted to confirm for myself, but I'm glad you're still with us."
"Are you? Or are you planning something even bigger for me?" Lily responded,smiling as well.

Ariana chuckled. "Well, yes, but it's a surprise. You'll just have to be patient." She slowly walked around the room, making sure her words sunk in. "It's a grand surprise, Lily. All you need to do is recover, get discharged, and it'll be waiting for you. You'll be completely shocked when you see what I have in store for you."

Lily smiled, but there was a dangerous gleam in her eyes. "I didn't realize we were such good friends that you'd give me a gift-and such a big one."

Ariana smirked, sitting down on one of the couches and crossing her legs."
Oh, this will be a final gift. I guarantee it'll send you straight to heaven-or maybe hell."

Lily's eyes sparkled with what seemed like excitement, unsettling Ariana.Why was she smiling? She had to admit, Lily's reaction made her uneasy,but Ariana was confident this time she wouldn't fail.

"Thank you for the heads-up, Ariana Martinez. I'll be looking forward to it," Lily said with a smile of her own.

"Good to know," Ariana replied, her voice dripping with malice.

"Care for some coffee before you go?"

"I'll pass. I have other places to be. I just returned to the country, after all."Ariana said as she stood and headed toward the door.

"Enjoy what little time you have left," Lily called after her.

Ariana paused, turning back to face her.
"Let's see who gives the bigger surprise. Because I've got one for you too-and mine will send you straight to hell!"
###Chapter 130

Ariana stormed out of the room, slamming the door hard behind her to express her fury. As she left the hospital, her mind was consumed with thoughts of what Lily had said, and the anger inside her only grew.Lily's words echoed in her memory, fueling her rage. Ariana started to wonder what Lily might be planning against her, but she was determined to strike first. There was no way Lily would be able to make a move without Alexander knowing about it.

Without hesitation. Ariana pulled out her phone and made a call.

"Ma'am," the voice on the other end answered.

"Get it done immediately. I'm out of patience," Ariana ordered, her tone icy.

"Understood, ma'am," the person replied before hanging up.

Samson, who was driving, glanced at her through the rearview mirror and shook his head slightly. He wished she could just let all of this go, but Ariana never listened. He silently hoped her obsession with Alexander wouldn't lead to her downfall. From wwhat he had heard, Lily was the calm but vengeful type-maybe not as ruthless as Alexander, but if you hurt the people she loved, she'd come after you with a vengeance.

Since his boss had chosen this dangerous path, Samson felt obligated to support her to the end because he genuinely cared for her.

In one of Alexander's secret locations, the screams of men being tortured echoed from one of the rooms. Alexander had captured more individuals linked to the gang that had attacked Lily and his daughter. He was determined to extract information about the gang leader's whereabouts,no
matter how long it took.

As Alexander stood there, watching the torture unfold, he still wasn't satisfied. He wished they would suffer even more. The torment continued for over an hour before Roland,one of his men, entered and whispered something in his ear. This caused Alexander to raise his hand,signaling the torturers to stop.


Alexander left the torture room with Roland and walked into a spacious office with a desk, couches, and an executive chair.

"What was it you just told me?" Alexander asked.

"You instructed us to monitor any visitors to Mrs. Kane who weren't family or close friends. I received word from the men watching her that Ariana visited her today. Interestingly, MMrs. Kane requested that her security not be present when Ariana arrived. They spoke for about 20minutes before Ariana left in a rage, accompanied by her bodyguard,"Roland explained.

Alexander listened intently. "Did you find out where she was when the accident happened?"

"Yes, sir. She traveled out of the country the day before the accident,supposedly for business with her assistant, who was hired by her mother."

"Track her calls during that time, and find out where they were made from.
" Alexander ordered.

"You think she's behind it?"

"Why else would she visit Lily?" Alexander replied coldly.

"I suppose only Lily knows why Ariana was there. Maybe you should ask
your wife-and take the chance to spend some time with her. You've missed her, even if you don't want to admit it." Roland suggested.

"Focus on finding out what Ariana did overseas, including who she communicated with. After what happened with her previous assistant, who's now in prison, I wouldn't be surprised if she's involved in this too,"Alexander said, ignoring Roland's suggestion about spending time with Lily.

"And if we find nothing?"

"Then bring her here," Alexander replied.

Roland nodded and left to carry out his orders. He had left his own company's affairs to assist Alexander and preferred this work to sitting behind a desk, dealing with dull paperwork.

As he got into his car, his phone buzzed with a news alert. The headline caught his attention: *ARIANA SPEAKS OUT ABOUT THE KANE ACCIDENT.*


Roland clicked on the link to watch the live news broadcast.

"MRS. MARTINS,CAN YOU TELL US WHY YOU VISITED MRS. KANE IN THE HOSPITAL,CONSIDERING YOU TWO AREN'T EXACTLY CLOSE?"


"Well, we were close before certain issues arose between us. I've always admired Mrs. Kane and even thought we might become like sisters one day. So, as soon as I heard about the accident, I went straight from the airport to the hospital to check on her," Ariana said, her voice filled with false warmth.

Ariana continued her speech, clearly aware that her visit to Lily would
make Alexander suspicious. She'd called the reporters herself,giving this public statement to manipulate the narrative. She knew Lily wouldn't tell Alexander about her visit because whatever Lily was planning,she wanted to handle it without involving her husband.

Smiling to herself, Ariana thought about how this would drive a wedge between Alexander and Lily. He despised liars and betrayers, and once he found out, he'd cast Lily out of his life-just as he had done to his mother.But Ariana didn't plan to wait that long. She intended to eliminate Lily and take her place as Alexander's wife.


After watching the interview, Roland instructed his driver to turn around and head back to the base. When he returned, he found Alexander at his desk,reviewing documents related to their underground operations.

"Did you see the news?" Roland asked.

"Yes."

"So, what's the next move?"

"Do what I told you to do," Alexander said firmly.

"The media will be watching closely after her interview. They'll be waiting to see how we respond," Roland warned.

Alexander's cold gaze silenced him. "Understood. I'll continue the investigation. If I find anything, I'll drag her back here," Roland replied.

Meanwhile,Carolina, Ariana's mother, had seen the interview and was waiting for her daughter to return. As soon as Ariana walked through the door,Carolina confronted her.

"What did you just do?"
"Mother, I've just returned from a stressful trip. Can't you greet me before launching into questions?" Ariana responded irritably.

"Why would you visit her? And why do I get the feeling you're involved in this, despite your assistant telling me you were busy with work?"

"You can accuse me all you want. Mother. It's nothing new," Ariana said dismissively, heading upstairs.

Carolina sighed. "I just hope you're not doing something that'll be your undoing," she said softly.

Ariana paused on the staircase and looked back. "Don't worry, I won't fail," she replied confidently before heading to her room and shutting the door.

Back at the hospital, Lily had also seen the interview and couldn't help but laugh. So, Ariana was afraid of Alexander's suspicion? But even after this public stunt, Alexander would still keep an eye on her. Soon, Lily would be discharged from the hospital, and she would deal with Ariana herself.


Ariana would pay for the death of Pedro, her loyal bodyguard,for the condition she had left Angela in, and for targeting her and her family.Ariana's end was near.
###Chapter 131

A few days later, the time finally came for Lily to be discharged from the hospital after two long weeks. Alexander had agreed to let her go.

"The security team will be here shortly to pick you and Viola up." Roland informed her.


"Mmm," she murmured in response.

Roland turned to leave but paused. "I know things aren't right between you and Alexander, but please don't do anything that will push him further away. I'm begging you," he said, his tone full of concern before walking out.


Lily understood why he was so serious. It wasn't just because the situation had affected everyone, especially changing Alexander's behavior, but because Roland feared for her safety. He knew that if anything happened to her, Alexander would lose it since she meant everything to him.

Reflecting on Roland's words made Lily briefly reconsider her plan.However, she knew who was after her and believed that person had a plan in motion to eliminate her. She couldn't back down.


"Are you having second thoughts?" Sarah, her friend, asked,noticing Lily deep in thought.

"I did for a second, but I'm sticking with my plan. Things will only get worse if I don'"t,"Lily replied.

Sarah sighed. Lily had already shared her plan with her, and while Sarah wished Alexander could handle everything, she couldn't deny that Lily's plan was solid. She would support her.
"Are your discharge papers ready?"

"Yes."

"Has Michael arrived?"

"Michael? Why do you need him?"

"Because I'm leaving without Alexander's knowledge."

"But Roland just said the car would be here to take you and Viola home."

Lily smiled slightly at her confused friend. "Yes, but I'm not taking that car."


"What are you planning now?" Sarah was growing more concerned.

"I'm not going home."

"Then where are you going? What's your plan?"

"I'm heading to my family's house."

"What? Why? You know Alexander won't allow that."

"Of course, but I'm an adult. He can't force me to go back with him."

"Is this because you're afraid he has some kind of punishment waiting for you at home?"

"No. To carry out my plan, I need to be apart from him. I want it to seem like we've separated. If I told him my plan, he wouldin't agree, so I have to do this without his knowledge."

"And what will you tell him?"
"Don't worry about that."

Sarah rubbed her pregnant belly, feeling the stress build up. "Baby,let's hope your godmother isn't making a huge mistake," she sighed

Lily glanced at her friend's belly and smiled.


Meanwhile, at Alexander's secret base, Roland presented him with the findings on Ariana.


"We discovered that she left the country for business. We checked her call logs, and there's one call that can't be traced."

"Who did she contact?"

"We couldn't identify the recipient, but the strange thing is that the call was made at the exact time the accident happened."


Alexander's eyes locked onto Roland. "Then what are you waiting for?Bring her here!" he snapped.

Even though Lily and Viola were safe, Alexander's anger over the attack hadn't subsided. Weeks had passed, but he had yet to find the person responsible. Whoever it was had hidden well, but Alexander wouldn't rest until he uncovered the truth.

"It's not that simple. Since her interview last week, the media's focused on her. If she suddenly disappears, it'll raise suspicion, and the police will quickly get involved."

Alexander slammed his hand on the desk in frustration. For the first time.things weren't going his way. Ariana was clever-he knew this all too well.She'd been close to him once and understood how he operated. Her moves were always calculated, but Alexander was determined to catch her
off guard.

"You think she's behind it?" Roland asked.

"Everyone's a suspect," Alexander replied coldly.

Roland nodded."I'll keep digging."

Just then, Roland's phone rang. He answered quickly. "Yes?"

Alexander watched him closely.

Roland's expression tightened. "What do you mean they left before you arrived?" he said into the phone.

Alexander snatched the phone from Roland's hand. "What did you say?"he demanded.

The guard stammered, "Boss... I..."

"Speak!"

"The lady boss and your daughterleft the hospital before I could pick them up."

"What do you mean they left before you arrived?!" Alexander yelled.

"I'm sorry,boss."

Alexander ended the call, furious, and threw the phone onto the couch.He grabbed his own phone and called Clara.

Clara answered immediately."Yes,Mr.Kane?"

"Are Lily and Viola at home?"
"No,sir."

Alexander clenched his jaw. He was growing increasingly agitated.Roland stood there, knowing that if anything happened to them, he would be held responsible.


Alexander dialed Lily's number, tapping his fingers on the desk impatiently. Atthat moment, Lily had just arrived at her family estate and saw his name flash on her phone. Her heart raced, but she answered.

"Alexander."

"Why did you leave the hospital without the guards? Where are you,and why aren't you at home?" His tone was sharp,demanding answers.

"I'm at my family's estate."

"That's not your home anymore."

"It's still my family's home, Alexander. I've decided to stay here with Viola for now."


There was a long pause.

"It's safer for us to stay here until we find out who's after us. It seems like whoever's targeting us wants us apart. We'll only be safe when that person is gone," she explained, wwaiting for him to argue or insist she come home.But instead, he simply said, "Okay," before hanging up.

Tears welled in Lily's eyes, but she quickly wiped them away so Viola wouldn't see. Separating herself from Alexander was painful, but she believed everything would return to normal once she dealt with Ariana.

"Where is she?" Roland asked.
"She's staying with her family until we figure out who's behind this,"Alexander replied, his voice thick with emotion.

Roland could feeI Alexander's pain but didn't know how to console him.

"Send more security to her family's estate. Make sure they're the best."

"I'll do that right away. Anything else?"

"Tell the driver to get ready. I've got meetings to attend at the company.I've delayed them long enough."


Roland was taken aback. Alexander had been avoiding work for weeks,but now he was suddenly diving back in.

He hoped this wasn't a sign that Alexander was returning to his old,workaholic ways-the way he used to cope before meeting Lily. It seemed like he was slowly becoming the man he once was, and that worried Roland.
###Chapter 132

Caleb took a sip of his green tea, then set the cup down, turning his attention to his granddaughter, sitting across from him.

"I was surprised when I heard you arrived here with all your belongings.What's going on? Why did you make this decision, my child?" he asked.


Lily lowered her eyes, staring at the teain her hand. "I've decided that Viola and I will stay here for a while. Alexander is aware of it," she replied.


Caleb leaned back in his chair, studying her. "My granddaughter is not someone who runs away when faced with challenges or enemies trying to bring her down. So, what's truly going on in your mind? Why are you really here?" He was pleased to have her and his great-granddaughter with him, but he knew Lily wouldn't choose to stay away from Alexander without a serious reason. She loved him deeply and wouldn't willingly distance herself from him without cause.

Lily hesitated, unsure of how to begin, but knowing she had to explain her plan to her grandfather. He needed to understand who was behind everything and how she intended to put an end to itfor good.

"I know who's responsible for all of this, Grandfather," she finally said.

Caleb straightened immediately, his face full of anger. "Who?! Tell me right now!"

"Please, sit down. I'll explain everything," she urged.

"How can you be so calm, knowing this?!" he shouted. They had been searching for the culprit, and to find out Lily knew all along left him in disbelief. He couldn't understand how his smart and sharp-witted
granddaughter could have kept this information from him.

"There's a reason I've been quiet."

"What possible reason could you have for hiding the person's identity?!"he demanded.


"Because this is something I need to handle on my own. I need to end it myself."


Caleb shook his head, incredulous. "You're making a mistake. Give me the name, and I'll make sure that person disappears without a trace."

"I'll tell you, but only if you promise to stay calm and not take any rash actions."


"I can't promise that, especially after they almost killed you! You could have been the one in a coma, not Alexander's mother!"

"Please, Grandfather," she begged, dropping to her knees. "All I'm asking is for you to support me in what I'm about to do. The media is alreadyall over her, and if we do something drastic like kill her, it'll bring unwanted attention to us. We need to be smart."

"It's a woman?" Caleb asked, surprised.

Lily nodded.

"Who is it?"

"Grandfather,please-"

"I said,who is it?!"

"It's Ariana Martins,"
Caleb's eyes darkened. "Why didn't I see that? That woman has been nothing but trouble for you since she arrived in this city. Isn't she Alexander's ex, the one who betrayed him?"

Lily nodded again.

"And you don't plan to tell Alexander?"

"No. He'll find out everything she's done, just like the rest of the world will, in about a week."


"What exactly are you planning?"

Lily stood up and walked over to him. "Please, sit first, Grandfather."

Caleb sat down again, and Lily joined him. "I know what Alexander will do if I tell him, so I've decided to take action myself. That's why I've come here, to keep my plans hidden from him. But I need your help.I need your underground contacts and resources."

"I'll help you, but only if your plan is good. If it's not, you'll let me handle it my way."

Lily nodded. "Alright,Grandfather."

"So, what's your plan?" Caleb asked, folding his arms and waiting for her to reveal the details.

Lily leaned in and laid out her strategy. By the time she finished, her grandfather was looking at her with admiration. Seeing the expression on his face, Lily knew she had impressed him, but she still waited fe verbal response.

"What do you think,Grandfather?"
Caleb nodded. "Go ahead with your plan. I'll support you one hundred percent."

Lily let out a sigh of relief. "Thank you, Grandfather."

They spent the rest of the evening discussing other things and later had dinner together with Viola.

After enjoying his time with his granddaughter and great-granddaughter,Caleb was about to retire for the night when Victor, his right-hand man,informed him that Alexander had placed several guards outside the villa,guarding the outer walls.

Dismissing Victor, Caleb picked up the phone and called Alexander, who answered immediately.

"Grandfather," Alexander said.

It was unusual for him to pick up so quickly, but he did because his wife and daughter were under Caleb's care.

"Acting all respectful now, are we?" Caleb teased.

"How are they,Grandfather?"

The only thing in the world that could make Alexander so polite and respectful was his love for Lily and Viola.

"Why do you have an army outside my walls?" Caleb asked. Victor had reported seeing a large number of guards, and upon checking the footage.Caleb confirmed that it looked like an army protecting the estate.

"For their protection."

"You know I have my own men guarding the property inside and out.
What's the need for all this?"

"I'won't be able to sleep at night if I don't know they're fully protected.After everything that's happened, you should expect this from me."

"Fine. I'll let it slide, but don't go overboard," Caleb said before hanging up.

Alexander looked at the phone, then turned to James, who was waiting for instructions.


"Make sure the team monitoring Lily and my daughter sends daily reports of their activities."

The following morning, after breakfast with Viola and her grandfather.Lily left her family's estate and headed to the hospital, leaving Viola in Caleb's care. She had several stops to make that day, starting with the hospital.

Arriving at the VIP ICU unit where Angela was being treated. Lily changed and went in to see her. Tears filled her eyes as she saw Angela's condition. All of this had happened because of one person's greed, a person who wanted something that didn't belong to her.

Lily had been the target, but Angela had paid the heavier price. Holding Angela's hand, she kissed it gently.

"Please wake up soon. I promise you, by the time you wake, all of this will be over. I have a plan, and the enemy will be dealt with," she whispered,still holding Angela's hand.

After leaving the hospital, Lily visited the grave of Pedro, her bodyguard.who had tragically died in the accident. She placed flowers on his grave, lit some incense, and offered a prayer, bowing three times.
"You gave your life to protect us, and I promise to bring the person responsible to this very spot to beg for forgiveness," Lily said, tears rolling down her cheeks. Pedro's death weighed heavily on her. He had been a loyal bodyguard and, more than that, a good man. Without a family of his own, Pedro had been an orphan who served in the military. Now, he was gone, cut down in his youth. Ariana had robbed him of the chance to live and start his own family.

"I swear, she will pay for everything. And when that happens,you'll finally be able to rest in peace. Just give me a few days, and it will all be over," she vowed.


"In just a few days,it will all be over."
###Chapter 133

Anthony stared at his wife, Sarah, who was giving him her usual attitude.They were supposed to return home, as they didn't live in this country,but she had refused. According to her, she needed to stay close to her friends right now.

He had already asked the staff to pack their bags, and the jet was ready,but she remained adamant.


"Let's just go, okay? I promise we'll be back soon," Anthony urged.

Sarah looked at him with a sad expression. "No, you can go without me."

"I can't leave you here, especially since you're so far along. You're almost due, and we agreed you would deliver in Country C, didn't we?"

Sarah reluctantly nodded. "Yes, but... I could have the baby here. It's not like giving birth here would stop our child from being a citizen of your country."

Anthony sighed in frustration, sitting close to her and gently turning her face to him. "I know you're worried about your friend, but Alexander is perfectly capable of protecting his family."

"I know, but we can't leave now, not yet," Sarah replied seriously.

"Why? Is there something you're not telling me?"

Sarah shook her head. "No, I'm just worried." She bit her lip. She couldn't risk telling Anthony about Lily's plan, or Alexander would find out, which would ruin everything. Plus, Lily wouldn't forgive her. The real reason she couldn't leave was because she needed to help Lily in some way.
Anthony felt something was off but didn't push for more details. He just nodded.


Sarah sighed in relief, grateful he wasn't going to pressure her to reveal more, and then tried to change his mind about leaving.

"Baby, can't wve just stay? I can give birth here," she said sweetly.

Anthony almost fell for her charm but quickly snapped out of it. "No.love,we're going home. Be a good wife and let's go."


Sarah felt like crying. How was she going to explain to Lily that she was leaving?


Sensing her emotions, Anthony kissed her forehead and her lips. "Don't worry, we'll be back soon. I've got a lot of business to handle, and you're almost ready to give birth." Sarah turned away from him.

"Do you want me to help you get dressed?"

She declined. "I'll do it myself."

"Okay, I'll wait for you outside." Anthony kissed her forehead before leaving the room.

Once she was sure he was gone, Sarah quickly grabbed her phone and called Lily. It rang once, but she didn't pick up. She tried again. Lily had said she was meeting with Michael and Jacob today, so she was probably with them.

Sarah was supposed to help Lily with her plans, especially since she had skills in espionage and going undercover, but now everything was at risk.Finally, Lily picked up. "Hey Sarah, where are you? We're waiting for you."
Sarah bit her bottom lip, unsure how to explain.

"I' won't be able to come. Lily. I'm sorry."

"What? Why? What happened?" Lily asked, concerned.

Michael and Jacob were also alerted.

"No, nothing's wrong. It's just that Anthony insists we leave the country today. I tried to convince him to stay, but he won't budge, so now I'm about to get dressed so we can leave."


Lily was sad to hear this, but she understood. With Sarah so close to delivering, maybe leaving was for the best.

"It's okay, Sarah. I wish you could stay, but I think it's for the best."

"But how can I help you if I'm not here?"

"We can still communicate through our secret chat group and video calls.Don't worry."

"Are you sure?" Sarah asked, still uncertain.

"Yes, I'm sure."

"What do Michael and Jacob think about this?"

Lily looked at the two men, and they nodded.

"They think you should go as well."

Sarah sighed. "Okay, I'll miss you," she said sadly.

"I'll miss you too."
"Please don't lose to that woman."

Lily laughed. "I won't. I'm going to win."

Sarah smiled. "Good."

"I love you,Sarah."

"Love you too.Bye."

"Bye."

After the call ended, Sarah felt downcast. The door opened, and Anthony walked in, noticing she still wasn't dressed and appeared unhappy.

Worried, he sat next to her and pulled her onto his lap. "What's wrong,my love?"

"Nothing, I'm just sad about leaving."

"I promise we'll be back soon, okay?"

She nodded.

When she thought she'd have her friend by her side, it turned out she wouldn't.


Meanwhile, Michael, Jacob, and Lily continued with their planning.Michael voiced his concerns about their strategy.

"Seems like it'll just be the three of us now," Michael said.

"Yes, but we'll do just fine," Lily replied confidently. "Sarah will still help us from afar."

"So when do we strike?" Michael asked.
"We strike when Ariana makes her move."

Michael wasconfused. "Wait, what do you mean?"

"I thought Lily explained everything to you," Jacob chimed in.

"No," Michael replied, looking at Lily.

Lily then explained, "Jacob has successfully hacked into Ariana's phones,computers, and those of her close associates. We'll know when she plans to make her move."


Michael was stunned. "Wait,what?"

"We'll act when she does," Jacob clarified.

"That's smart, hacking her devices. But why wait for her to attack?Why not strike first and expose her with the evidence you've gathered? There's no need to take unnecessary risks."

Lily understood but had a different plan. "We're setting a trap for her."

"You should review our entire plan; it'll make more sense," Jacob added.

Michael knew the plan, but he wasn't fully comfortable with how they were going to execute it. Why wait for Ariana to strike? He feared things could go wrong.

"Don't worry,Michael. Everything will go smoothly. I won't let anything get out of hand," Jacob reassured him. Michael just nodded, and they carried on with their strategy.

Meanwhile, Sarah and Anthony were already at the airport, preparing to leave. Although Lily had given Sarah the green light to go,she still wished she could persuade her strong-headed husband to stay. She stared at
Anthony, who was talking to the pilot, a frown etched on her face.

Later that night, as Lily finished meeting with Jacob and Michael,she returned home. When her car pulled up to the gates of her family's estate,she noticed a familiar vehicle parked nearby. Her heart skipped a beat. It was Alexander, and he was alone-no driver or guards in sight.

Alexander stepped out of his car and strode toward Lily's vehicle as it came to a stop. He motioned or her to get out, and she did.

He scanned her from head to toe before asking, "What have you been up to today?"


"Your men have been following me everywhere, so why ask what I've been doing?" she replied.


Alexander knew where she had been, but he couldn't understand why she had spent so much time with Jacob and Michael. He had come here because he desperately wanted to see her.


Without warning, Alexander pulled her into a hug and kissed her forehead.
"Why can't you just come home?" he asked, his anger melting away.

"I promise I won't be angry anymore. Please, come home with our daughter," he pleaded.


Lily swallowed hard and bit her bottom lip,trying to stop herself from agreeing. Only he knew how much she longed to be with him, to share the same bed, to kiss him, to make love to him. But she had to hold back-returning home would ruin everything.

"Alexander,I..."

"Go on," he encouraged.
"I can't. Not while our enemies are still out there."

"You don't have to worry about that. I'm going to catch whoever is behind this soon. Just come home," he pleaded again.

Lily shook her head. "I can't," she said. If she went back, Ariana would continue to move freely.


Alexander clenched his fists, his anger not directed at Liy but at the person keeping them apart.

"Fine," he said, "but don't do anything behind my back, or I won't forgive you." With that, he turned and walked back to his car, driving off in a rush.


Lily stood there, deep in thought, a new fear creeping in: the fear that Alexander would discover her plan.
###Chapter 134

There was only one person truly overjoyed by Alexander and Lily's breakup: Ariana. She had gone to great lengths to destroy their relationship. Ariana was aware that Lily had a plan and leaving Alexander's house was part of it. What shehadn't counted on was Alexander allowing it because, despite his deep love for Lily, Ariana expected him to prevent her from moving out. His decision to let her leave meant that his feelings for Lily were weakening.

The information Ariana received was that Alexander had been furious with Lily after the accident and blamed her for it. This confirmed her suspicions and fed her belief that things were finally going her way.With that out of the way, she could now set her own plans in motion. However,before eliminating Lily for good, she planned to spread malicious rumors about her. Ariana wanted Alexander to hear these lies, so his love for Lily would fade. That way, when she finally got rid of Lily, he wouldn't mourn her loss.


Ariana laughed wickedly, her joy evident as she reveled in her foolproof plan. Lily knew Ariana would come after her but had no idea of the smear campaign Aríana had in store for her before attempting to take her life.Everything was set to unfold in a few days.

"I'm going to let you enjoy your final days, Lily. Savor them while you can," Ariana whispered with a grin, sipping her coffee. As she gazed up at the night sky, she admired its beauty, basking in her triumph.

Samson was just arriving home when he spotted her sitting on the balcony.
A sense of dread filled him, as he knew things were getting out of hand.Though he wanted to stop her, he couldn't. He was too drawn to herto
leave her alone in all this madness. Samson cared for her too much to let
her face this on her own, even though he feared Ariana was losing her grip on reality-and fast.

The following morning, Lily was in the kitchen preparing a special breakfast for her grandfather. She asked one of the maids to informn him that breakfast was ready. Caleb came downstairs and made his way to the table, where his adorable great-granddaughter was already seated.

"How's my lovely granddaughter this morning?" Caleb asked.


“Great Grandpa!” Viola jumped out of her chair and ran toward him for a hug. Caleb lifted her off the ground and held her close.

"How's my little one doing today?" he asked warmly.

“I'm fine, Great Grandpa! How about you? Did you sleep well?”


Caleb chuckled. “Yes, my dear. And my morning just got even better seeing you.”

“The food smells delicious, I can't wait to try it!" he added,catching the aroma from the kitchen.


“That's because Mommy made it just for you!” Viola exclaimed proudly.

“Really? I'm in 'for a treat, then!"

Lily smiled as she watched them interact. She joined them and greeted her grandfather with a cheerful"good morning." The three of them sat down to enjoy breakfast together, and Lily was pleased to see how much Caleb enjoyed the meal she had prepared.

Once breakfast was over, she made sure Viola was settled for her home lessons with the arriving tutorsbefore heading to her grandfather's office.
There, she updated him on the progress of her plans. Afterward, she got dressed and left to meet Jacob and Michael at their hideout.

When Lily arrived, she found Jacob working intensely on his computer.“What's happening?" she asked.

Jacob turned to her immediately. “Do you know what Ariana's planning now?”


"You mean Ariana?" Lily asked, moving closer.

He nodded. “She's about to spread some major falsehoods about you across all media outlets."


Lily raised an eyebrow. “What kind of falsehoods?”

Jacob revealed the details, and Lily smiled, unperturbed.“Let her spread them.”


“What? Why would you want that? You know how much Alexander dislikes Michael. When he hears these lies about you two being involved,especially with the fake evidence she's manufactured, everyone will think it's true! Your company will suffer, and who knows what Alexander will do!” Jacob ranted, his worry spilling out as Michael, who had just entered,overheard everything.

“What did I just walk in on?” Michael was taken aback.

Both Lily and Jacob turned to him.

"It's nothing but lies," Lily reassured him.

“Sure, but it's going to ruin your reputation!" Michael protested.He cared deeply for Lily, almost like a sister, and couldn't bear to see her name
dragged through the mud.

"It'll only be for a few days, just until she moves to the next phase of her plan."

"So,you're willing to let this go on? Have you even thought about how Alexander will react when he hears about this? We might be forced to reveal everything before he turns on us!" Michael exclaimed, his fear not of what Alexander would do to him, but of what he would do to Lily.

Given Alexander's history, he despised disloyalty and infidelity. Even though he loved Lily, he wouldn't tolerate such betrayal. Ariana knew this,which was why she crafted these lies in thefirst place.

“And the deepfake she's created looks incredibly real. She even fabricated a photo of you and Michael in bed together," Jacob added,concerned.

Lily took a moment to think. She needed a solid plan now that Ariana was launching such damaging attacks. Once the rumors spread the next day, Alexander would surely come after Michael, and she needed to be ready.

The best move would be to play along.

“What's going through your mind?” Michael asked, noticing her thoughtful expression.

"We need to play along."

“Play along? What do you mean?" Michael asked, confused.

“We need to let her believe she's winning," Lily clarified.

“How?”he asked.
"You're going to have to go into hiding."

"I can do that. But what about you?"

"I'll stay at mny grandfather's and wait for her next move."

"If Michael's going into hiding, does that mean I should too?"Jacob asked.

"Yes,you both need to go to the cabin we've set up in the woods.Everything you need is already there. I'll stay in touch with you both and let you know when Ariana contacts me because she'll want to after she's convinced she's successfully ruined my reputation."

"In all of this, aren't you thinking about how Alexander will feel?” Michael asked, struggling to understand Lily's strategy.

Lily sighed.“This will be a test for Alexander too. I know he hates lies and betrayal, but he'll need to prove how much he trusts me by not believing some internet gossip."

Jacob and Michael exchanged uneasy glances.

“And what if Alexander believes the rumors?" Jacob asked quietly.

A tear slipped from Lily's eye. “Then it means our marriage is over," she said,her voice trembling.
###Chapter 135

After she was sure that Michael and Matthew had left the city safely to a hideout in the countryside, Lily returned home just in time for dinner with her grandfather and Viola. Viola was overjoyed to see her mother, eager to tell her about her day. Her teachers had taught her something new, and she couldn't wait to share it. She had already told her great-grandfather,Caleb, but she was saving the best for her mother.

During dinner, Lily enjoyed time with her daughter, laughing and smiling at every little thing she said. It was moments like these that made her forget her worries, even though she knew that a battle with Ariana was looming.

Once she put Viola to bed, Lily headed to her grandfather Caleb's study to update him on the latest developments. When Caleb heard about Ariana's plan to ruin Lily's reputation by accusing her of cheating, hewas furious.He refused to sit idly by and let someone destroy his granddaughter's good name.


Lily had to calm him down, pleading with him to trust her. She assured him that the rumors would only last a few days and that soon enough.everyone would see Ariana for who she truly was. Caleb, although reluctant, eventually agreed to let Lily handle the situation on her own,but he made her promise that if things went sideways, he would step in-and if necessary, he would even involve Alexander Kane.

After their conversation, Lily went to her room, took a bath, and lay down in bed, trying to prepare herself for what the next day would bring.

At precisely 6 a.m., Ariana's plan had gone into full effect. She had successfully planted the fabricated story about Lily and Michael's alleged
affair across all media platforms in the country.

The news spread like wildfire. As people walked the streets, most were glued to their phones, reading the scandalous headlines:

**"The Heiress of the Blake Empire and Wife of Multinational Business Mogul,Lily Kane, Accused of Having an Affair with Longtime Friend and Tech Entrepreneur, Michael!"**


James, Alexander's assistant, was shocked when he saw the news. He was almost certain that Alexander hadn't seen it yet-after all, Alexander wasn't one to check the news first thing in the morning. But James was terrified of how his boss would react once he did see it. Alexander had been under immense stress since Lily left his side, throwing himself into his work and drinking more than usual, trying to distract himself from the loneliness he felt without her.


James could see his boss sitting at the breakfast table, absentmindedly sipping coffee while preparing to head to the office. Anxiety bubbled inside James. How on earth was he supposed to break this news to Alexander?

His hands started trembling, and his foot tapped nervously on the floor.The constant tapping finally caught Alexander's attention.


“What's wrong with you?” Alexander's voice was sharp. He knew that whenever James acted like this, something was seriously wrong.

James stopped in his tracks, his heart pounding. He hadn't expected Alexander to notice, not with everything on his mind.

"Well? Speak!" Alexander's tone was authoritative, leaving no room for hesitation.

James swallowed hard, his gaze drifting toward the tablet in his hand. The
fear in his eyes didn't go unnoticed by Alexander, who immediately realized the problem must be on that tablet.


"Give it here," Alexander commanded, motioning for James to hand him the device.


"Sir, you're not going to like this," James muttered, his voice barely above a whisper as he passed the tablet over.


Alexander snatched the tablet, and the first thing that caught his eye was the headline. His brow furrowed, and his face darkened with anger. “Who the hell dared to spread such blatant lies about my wife? Do they have a death wish?”


He was about to instruct James to track down the media outlet responsible and sue them, but sömething made him pause. He decided to read the article in full before jumping to conclusions.

James held his breath as his boss scrolled through the article, knowing full well what was about to unfold. Alexander read every word, examined every doctored image that served as "evidence" of the alleged affair.

The next sound James heard was the tablet smashing against the wall. He winced as he looked over, seeing the shattered remains of the device lying on the floor. Alexander, seething with rage, immediately reached for his phone.

The fury that consumed Alexander now was the same he had felt when his mother had betrayed his father years ago. He didn't want to believe the story, but the photos-the photos looked so real. He needed to confront Lily directly, hear it from her before taking any drastic measures.

Lily had already woken up to find 20 missed calls on her phone, but none
of them were from Alexander yet. She figured he hadn't seen the news.Just as this thought crossed her mind, his call came through.

Her heart sank as she stared at the phone, dreading the conversation she knew was coming. After a brief hesitation, she picked up the call, but there was no sound from the other end.


"Alexander?"she said, her voice trembling slightly.


After a long, tense pauase, his voice finally came through, but it was cold,devoid of any warmth.“Have you seen the news?"

“Yes,”Lily replied quietly.

“Is it true? Did you cheat on me?” Alexander's voice was harsh,each word stinging like a whip.

Tears immediately filled Lily's eyes. Never in her life had she expected Alexander to ask her such a question. But here they were, thanks to Ariana's wicked plot.

"Answer me, Lily!" Alexander demanded,his patience wearing thin.

Lily's voice shook as she responded, tears streaming down her face."Alexander,you really think I would cheat on you?"

Alexander had wanted to believe the story was false when he first saw the headline. But the photos-they were so convincing. His mind was clouded with doubt.

"The photos... What do you have to say about them? They look real," he said, his fists clenched tightly.

Lily couId hardly breathe through her sobs. "Alexander, I could never do
that to you. You have to believe me."

But Alexander was still not convinced. "If Michael has anything to do with this, he's a dead man. By the time I'm done with him. I'll deal with you.I'll be in touch." And with that, he hung up the phone, leaving Lily devastated, staring at the screen in disbelief.

She collapsed onto her bed, sobbing uncontrollably. How could the man she loved so deeply now doubt her so much? Ariana had succeeded in poisoning his mind against her.

Meanwhile, Alexander was already on another call.

"Yes, boss?" came the voice on the other end of the line.

"Find Michael and bring him to one of our bases. I don't care how you do it-just get him. Now.”
###Chapter 136

The next person to call Lily was Sandra. She immedliately asked what was happening and what Lily planned to do to clear her name. She also warned that if Alexander saw the news, it would undoubtedly make him furious.especially considering what had happened between his parents.

Lily felt relieved that Sandra didn't accuse her outright, unlike so many others. “Has Grandma seen it?” she asked.

"No," Sandra replied. “I've made sure no one will show it to her today.Seeing this would bring back all the pain from what happened between her son and Angela. She had planned to visit Angela at the hospital today,but I convinced her to postpone it. Reporters are probably swarming the hospital.”

Lily sighed in relief, thankful that her grandmother, Helen, hadn't seen the news. “Thank you, Sandra, for keeping this from her-and for trusting me.



“Have you spoken to Alexander yet?" Sandra asked with concern.

“Yes,” Lily replied. “He's really upset."

“Alexander should know you'd never do something like this. Even if the pictures look convincing, it's obviously a setup. You're not that kind of person.”

Lily managed a weak smile. "I hope he realizes that. I still believe he'll trust me and not what's being said online."

Outside the Blake Corporation headquarters, a mob of reporters had gathered, eager to get a statement from Alexander about the scandal. Some
protestors were even demanding that he divorce Lily. There had always been people who disliked the fact that Alexander married her. Many had wanted him to marry their daughters or a wealthy socialite from H City.Now,with the rumors swirling, those voices were louder than ever.

“Mr. Kane, what do you plan to do about your wife's alleged affair with her close friend?" a reporter shouted.

"Are you going to divorce the heiress of the Blake Empire?" another one asked.


The questions kept coming, but Alexander ignored them all as his bodyguards shielded him from the press. He finally made his way inside the building.


“Get the company's security to clear out those reporters right away!”Alexander ordered sharply.

“On it, sir,” James, his assistant, replied before rushing out to follow his orders.


As soon as James left the office, he heard the sounds of objects being thrown and smashed against the walls. His boss's rage was obvious, and the tension in the air was thick.


Every employee in the building worked diligently, not wanting to add to Alexander's foul mood. They knew how deeply he cared for Lily, so hearing these rumors had undoubtedly hit him hard.

The press reported that Alexander had yet to make any public statement regarding the allegations.

Meanwhile, in another part of town, Ariana watched the news with a satisfied grin. “Even if he doesn't say anything publicly, I already know
what he's going to do. There's no way he'll let Michael get away with this.He'll probably kill him for touching his wife. As for Lily, she won't just be divorced-he'll make her regret everything.”

Ariana's smile widened as she imagined what would come next. With Lily out of the picture, Alexander would be lonely, vulnerable. Ariana planned to swoop in, ready to comfort him. She was certain that by nightfall,Alexander would head to his favorite nightclub, and she would be there,waiting to offer her support.

Samson, standing at the living room entrance, watched Ariana silently. He knew her plans, and it filled him with dread. If only he could stop her.But ruaining Lily's reputation wasn't enough for Ariana; she wanted to destroy her completely, even planning to make Lily's death look like an accident. Samson felt powerless to intervene.

Online, the insults aimed at Lily were relentless, worse than anything any celebrity had ever faced. Caleb, her grandfather, had been watching the news and reading the comments. The more he saw, the angrier he became.He couldn't believe the extent of the public outrage, all because of one woman determined to ruin his granddaughter's happiness and family.

Caleb was keeping his anger in check only because Lily had pleaded with him to remain patient, assuring him that she had a plan to handle everything. It was a good plan, and if it succeeded, the public's opinion would shift in her favor within days. When that happened, Caleb was determined to see that Lily received the public apology she deserved.

“If Alexander makes any public statement-no matter what he says-I'll make sure Lily divorces him," Caleb told Victor, who stood nearby.

Victor sighed but remained silent. There was nothing he could saythat would change the situation.
Meanwhile, Lily had spent her day ignoring calls from the company investors, and others. She was currently in an online chat with Michael and Jacob, her trusted friends.


Michael: "My security guy just called. Some men came looking for me at my house.”


Lily: “That's Alexander's men. He told me hie was going to deal with you."

Jacob: “You were right. Alexander's coming after Michael, just like you said he would if the news broke. He even visited our hideout, according to our lookout. I'm not sure how he knew about it.”

Michael:“I can't believe Alexander can't see that this is fake. I know the pictures look real, but he knows you better than anyone!"

Lily:"I don't want to dwell on that right now. Let's focus on our next step.What's Ariana been up to?"

Lily was doing her best to keep her mind from spiraling. She couldn't let Alexander's reaction distract her from dealing with Ariana.

Jacob:“Ariana booked a VIP table at the nightclub Alexander frequents. I'm guessing she's hoping he'll show up tonight, and she can use the opportunity to get close to him.”

Lily's heart sank. She knew Ariana would try to take advantage of the situation, but she didn't think it would happen this quickly. Ariana had tried to seduce Alexander before, and though she had failed, this time.with Alexander vulnerable,what if she succeeded?

Michael: “You shouldn't have told her," he muttered.

Jacob:"She would've found out eventually."
Lily read their messages but didn't respond immediately.

Lily: "Let's treat this as a test for him.”"

Michael wanted to ask, *What if he fails?* but he held back, not wanting to add to Lily's distress.


Lily: “What else is she planning?"

Jacob: “Her main scheme is still in motion, but she's working to ensure no one suspects her. You might not even get a direct confrontationfrom her."

Lily:"No matter how she tries to trap me, I'm ready."
###Chapter 137

As expected,**Alexander** arrived at the nightclub late into the night.**Ariana** had secured a VIP booth close to his and patiently waited. She thought he would come alone, but to her surprise, **Richard** and**Ethan** joined him ten minutes later.


Since the private rooms were soundproof, she had noway of overhearing their conversation. Determined to know what they were discussing,she bribed the server who was bringing drinks to their table to eavesdrop for her. After about ten minutes, the server returned with the details of their conversation.


“So, they're still supporting **Lily**, huh?”**Ariana** muttered with a scoff.

**Ariana** remained there for two hours until **Richard** left,leaving only **Ethan**. She knew **Ethan** would likely try to convince **Alexander**to go home, but she was sure **Alexander** would refuse, and once **Ethan** gave up, it would be her chance to act. With **Alexander's**bodyguards stationed all over the club, he didn't need further protection.

Just as she had predicted, **Ethan** left after failing to persuade **Alexander**, and now her mnoment had arrived. She waited for another twenty minutes before sneaking into **Alexander's** private room,managing to slip past the guards unnoticed. A smirk spread across her face as she saw that **Alexander** was already heavily intoxicated, the numerous empty bottles on the table confirming it.

She approached him and sat down. **Alexander** turned to her, his expression confused. "Who are you, and what are you doing here?" he asked with a frown.
"**Alexander**, I saw the news, and I'm so sorry yout're going through this.I'm here as a friend, to offer you some comfort. It's understandable that you're upset-no one would be fine after being betrayed by someone they love."


**Alexander** said nothing.

**Ariana** moved closer and reached for his hand, but he pulled away. “Leave."


"I just wanted to-”

"You're not wanted here," **Alexander** said coldly, dismissing her like any other woman seeking attention in the club.

“I can just sit quietly if that's what you prefer," she offered.

When he didn't respond, **Ariana** sat at a distance and watched as **Alexander** continued drinking. She planned to stay until the right moment presented itself.

Once he had consumed enough alcohol to nearly pass out, she leaned in closer, cupping his face in her hands. **Alexander** looked at her, trying to focus, but his vision was blurred. He blinked and squinted, and when he finally made out the face, he smiled faintly.

**Ariana** was shocked by the smile, knowing full well that**Alexander**would never smile at her. But then he whispered a name that made everything clear.

“**Lily**,"he murmured.

**Ariana's**heart sank. Even in his drunken state, **Alexander** was thinking of∗∗Lily∗∗,imagining her instead of **Ariana**. But she was
determined to use the opportunity to her advantage.

She leaned in and kissed him. **Alexander** didn't resist, believing she was **Lily**. He even kissed her back.

"I've missed you so much. Please comne back home," he said as he hugged her.


Hearing those words, **Ariana** felt like screaming. She wanted to tell him it was her, not **Lily**, but she couldn't.

“I cheated on you," she whispered.

**Alexander** pulled back and squinted at her again. Though her face was still a blur, her words seemed to hit him. “Yes, you did," he mumbled before pushing her away and standing up to leave.

He staggered toward the door and knocked for the guards to let him out.*Ariana** quickly hid behind the couch.

“Tie her up and bring her with us,”**Alexander** commanded,pointing toward where he had just been sitting.

The guards looked around, confused. "Sir, who are you talking about?"

“My wife-she's right there," **Alexander** insisted, pointing again. But the guards saw no one and had no recollection of anyone entering after **Ethan** left.

“Sir, I think it's the alcohol. You're imagining things. No one has comne in since Mr. **Ethan** left," one of the guards explained.

Though **Alexander** could see that no one was there, he was convinced he had just kissed his wife and that she had confessed to cheating. Hle had
planned to take her home and lock her away so he could punish her for her betrayal, but now, she had vanished.Had she disappeared?

Seeing **Alexander** lost in thought, the bodyguards gently reminded him of the time. "Sir, it's already 2 AM. We should head home."

**Alexander** mumbled in agreement, and his bodyguards helped him out of the club.


Once she was sure they had left, **Ariana** slipped out from her hiding spot and exited the private room. Her plan hadn't gone as expected. It seemed she would need to take a slower, more calculated approach with **Alexander**. But first, she needed to eliminate **Lily** from the picture.

**Alexander** woke up the next morning, still in his work clothes, with a splitting headache from the night before. He dragged himself to the shower,letting the water wash away the stench of alcohol. As his mind cleared.the events of the previous night came back to him. He realized the woman he kissed couldn't have been **Lily**-she didn't smell like her. But why had the woman acted líke **Lily**, even going so far as to admit to infidelity? The voice had sounded familiar, but he couldn't place it.

**Líly's** supposed betrayal still felt like a nightmare, something he desperately needed to wake up from. He didn't want to develop hatred for her,but he also couldn't ignore the reality. He had to confirm that what had happened wasn't just a bad dream.

After getting dressed, **Alexander** grabbed his phone. He needed to check the news again to verify if everything was as it seemed. Ignoring the barrage of missed calls and messages, he searched for the latest headlines.As expected, the morning news was still dominated by reports of **Lily's**alleged affair.
"So, it's true." **Alexander** muttered to himself, realizing this wasn't a nightmare after all.

Reluctantly, he forced himself to look at the photos again, needing to be absolutely certain. As much as he wanted to throw his phone in anger,he knew he had to examine them carefully. **Lily** had denied cheating when he called her yesterday, and he knew her body well enough-her shape, her birthmarks, her scars. If he could identify something in the photos that didn't align, he could prove her innocence.


Taking a closer look at the pictures, particularly those showing a bare back,
**Alexander's** anger slowly dissipated. Upon closer inspection,he realized the images were doctored. In other people's eyes, the photos would seem genuine, but now that he was paying attention,he noticed the absence of a scar **Lily** had on her lower back. The body didn't even
quite match hers.

**Alexander** slumped in his chair with a deep sigh. He had made a huge mistake by accusing his wife without verifying the facts. How could he make this right? He had been a terrible husband for doubting her.

Determined to fix things, **Alexander** showered, dressed, and headed out.He was going to the **Blake** estate to set things straight.

On the way, he got stuck in traffic in one of the city's busy areas.His attention was drawn to the breaking news being broadcast on a giant screen. His hands fell from the steering wheel, and his face went pale. "No,"he whispered, shaking his head in disbelief. "This can't be true."

His phone rang just then. It was **Ethan**.

“**Alexander**,where are you?" **Ethan** asked, souinding panicked.
"It's not her in that car. It can't be," **Alexander** said,his voice trembling. Although the car involved in the crash was registered to the **Blake** family, he refused to believe **Lily** was inside.

**Ethan** froze on the other end. "You've seen the news?"

“I won't believe it." **Alexander** insisted.

"We need to verify it first," **Ethan** said, trying to calm him. “I'll send you the location. Just stay composed."

**Alexander** couldn't process it. Not another accident. This one seemed even worse-the car had caught fire.

Staring at the burning vehicle on the screen, tears streamed down **Alexander's** face.“Please don't be in there," he whispered. “I can't live without you.”**
###Chapter 138

Several hours earlier, Ariana sat in a car nearby, waiting for the vehicle Lily was in to burst into flames. She had arranged for her people to plant a small device in the car that would cause it to crash and ignite. The plan was simple: Lily would either be killed or suffer severe injuries.

As she watched from a distance, the car sped along the road and then, as expected, it erupted in flames.

Earlier that morning, using an untraceable phone, Ariana had called Lily,who answered immediately.

"It's time we meet face-to-face, don't you think?" Ariana had said.

Lily smiled, as she had been anticipating this mnoment. "I agree. It's time we settle things. Only one of us will walk away from this, either you or me.



"Exactly, and I intend to be the one standing in the end," Ariana responded confidently.

Their conversation took place around 5 AM.

After the call ended, Lily told Jacob and Micheal about the conversation.They left their hiding spot and headed to where Lily was to meet Ariana.She also informed her grandfather, who was awake at that hour, and although he didn't want her to meet Ariana on her terms, Lily reassured him that everything was already in motion, and Ariana's plot wouldn't succeed.

Though Caleb was uneasy, he let his granddaughter proceed with her plans.
Lily prepared to leave the house after kissing her daughter, Viola, who was still sleeping. She got into a car with two bodyguards, and just as she did,Jacob called her.

Meanwhile,Ariana watched the vehicle Lily was in crash and burst into flames, her heart filled with satisfaction.


"Ma'am, what do we do next?" her associate asked.

"Make sure she's dead," Ariana replied.

Samson, who had been sitting with her, stared at the fiery wreckage in disbelief. He had tried to dissuade Ariana from going through with the plan, but his efforts had been in vain.

"I'll go check," Samson volunteered.

Ariana nodded. "I'm coming with you."

"It's unnecessary. There's no way she survived that," Samson insisted.

"I have to see it for myself," Ariana said firmly. "She escaped last time,so I need to be certain she's gone this time before moving on tothe next phase."

Seeing that he couldn't change her mind, Samson and Ariana approached the burning car. Once they were close, it was clear that no one could have lived through that.

They had been tracking the vehicle from the Blake estate, so they were sure it was the one Lily had entered.

"It's time to celebrate," Ariana said, her excitement barely contained.

"Let's get out of here before the police and reporters arrive," Samson
advised.

Ariana agreed, and they left the scene.

***

Back in the present...

Alexander raced to the scene and jumped out of his car. The fire had been put out, and investigators were already searching the wreckage for any signs of life.

He sprinted toward the vehicle, frantically shouting Lily's name, but Ethan quickly grabbed him.

"Get a hold of yourself. They need to confirm if she was in there first,"Ethan said.


Realizing the truth in Ethan's words, Alexander calmed down,though his anxiety was still high. He freed himself from Ethan's grip and headed back to his car.


"Where are you going?" Ethan asked.

"I need to confirm for myself."

"The investigators are already on it. Let them do their job," Ethan urged,but Alexander got into his car withoutreplying and sped off.

Ethan followed closely behind in his own vehicle.

Before long, Alexander arrived at the Blake estate and was immediately let inside. He wasn't going to sit around waiting for the police to tell him whether or not Lily had been in that car-he needed answers now.
The moment the guards saw him, they bowed and stepped aside to let him through.

Victor came down the stairs to greet him.

"Where is Lily? Is my daughter with her?" Alexander demanded, his voice full of desperation.

"Viola is still sleeping in her room," Victor replied.

"Is Lily with her?" Alexander couldn't bring himself to believe what the media was reporting-that Lily had been in that car.

Victor shook his head. "She left with bodyguards around 5 AM. She said she had somewhere to be."

"What car did she take?"-Alexander asked, holding his breath.

When Victor described the car, Alexander collapsed to his knees, gasping for air, as the reality set in. It was the same car that had caught fire.

"Mr. Kane, are you alright?" Victor called for the head maid. "Julian! Get the family doctor immediately!"

Hearing the commotion, Caleb rushed downstairs. "What's happening?"

He had heard Alexander had arrived but had no idea why Victor was shouting for the doctor. Victor rarely panicked, and for him to react this way meant something serious had occurred.

When Caleb saw Alexander's condition, he asked, "What's wrong with him?"

"I told him Lily left this morning, and he just collapsed."
"Get him to one of the rooms and lay him down until the doctor arrivres."Caleb instructed.


As they moved to assist Alexander, he suddenly pushed them away,his strength surprising given how weak he had seemed moments ago.

"I... need... to find her," Alexander said between labored breaths and turned to leave.


"Shouldn't we stop him, Master?" one of the staff asked.

"No," Caleb replied, suspecting there was more to Alexander's reaction than met the eye.


"Victor," Caleb called, "find out what's going on."

"Right away, Master."

"Something must have happened to Lily for Alexander to be in such a state." Caleb thought to himself.


Later,Caleb received the grim news and was shaken to the core, nearly losing control. He was on the verge of ordering assassins to go after Ariana.but his phone rang.


It was Lily.

"Grandfather," she said, her voice calm.

Stunned, Caleb shot to his feet. "Is it really you,Lily?"

"I had to call before you did something drastic," Lily explained.

Caleb exhaled deeply, thanking the heavens. "I'm relieved you're okay. I almost made a terrible mistake,"
"Where are you?" he asked.

"I'm safe."

"Have you seen the news?"

"Yes,I have."

"Then you know how devastated Alexander is right now."

"I know," Lily said, her voice heavy with emotion.

"He came here to the house and nearly collapsed after finding out you left this morning."

Lily was taken aback. "He was here? Is he alright?" she asked, her worry evident.


"We almost called the doctor, but he refused."

Tears welled up in Lily's eyes. "Where did he go? You should've stopped him."


"He said he was going to look for you. I don't think he believes what's being reported."

Everything had happened so fast. Lily hadn't anticipated that Ariana would take such extreme measures. At the last minute,Jacob had informed her that something felt off about the meeting spot Ariana had suggested.The location was miles away from where the GPS tracked her car. That's when Lily made the decision to get into a different vehicle that looked identical to the one Ariana had targeted.

The other car was on auto-drive, and with its tinted windows, it was impossible for anyone to tell that no one was inside.
Lily had witnessed the crash with her own eyes.

"Very soon, the media will report that no one was in the car. Alexander will know l wasn't inside."


"That's true," Caleb agreed.

"Please look after Viola for me, Grandfather."

"Of course."


"Thank you," Lily said, relieved.

"What's your next move?"

"I'm going to face her directly. This ends today."

"I'll send help."

"Thanks, Grandfather."

"Be careful," Caleb said, still concerned.


Had it not been for Lily's quick thinking, she would have perished in that fiery wreck. He couldn't bear to experience the anguish he had felt when he initially believed she was gone. His heart ached for Alexander, who was still in the dark about what had truly happened.

"I will, and one more thing," Lily added.

"What is it?"

"Father's been away for months, and you said he doesn't know anything about what's going on,right?"

The last thing Lily wanted was for her father to find out and rush home.
"No, there's no network where he is."

Peter was working on the new branch in a remote area with little to no connection to the outside world and had no idea what was unfolding back home.

Lily sighed in relief. "Thank you, Grandfather," she said, ending the call.

She looked around at her surroundings-a secluded spot with towering trees, leaves rustling in the wind, and birds chirping in the distance. This was the place where she would confront Ariana, just the two of them.

Taking a burner phone from her pocket, Lily dialed Ariana's number.

Ariana, in the middle of celebrating, answered a call from an unknown number.


"Hello?" she said, her voice brimming with excitement.

"Enjoying yourself?" Lily asked calmly.

The color drained from Ariana's face as she recognized the voice.

"You had your turn. Now it's mine," Lily said.
###Chapter 139

"H...how?"

Lily smiled. "You thought I was inside?"

Ariana's eyes widened. "How did you know?" she clenched her fist.

"Don't worry, I'll tell you when you get here. It will take you a few hours to arrive, and while you're on your way, make sure to come with your add-ons or lifejackes, because I promise you I won't miss as you did. I'll make sure you die by my hands."

"And if I don't?"

Lily smirked. "You wouldn't dare. I already have too much on you, Ariana.You have to face me whether you want to or not. It's either you die, or I die,Ariana."


"You're right. It's either you die or die," Ariana responded.

"I'll send you the location. You already planned to get rid of me before the car accident, which didn't work. Now that your plan has failed, I want you to bring your A-game because you won't believe what I've prepared for you,"Lily said before hanging up. She exhaled deeply, relieved.

Ariana could choose not to come, but she was too smart for that.

Still stunned, Ariana thought about how it seemed like Lily had nine lives.Her mind wandered to something Bella, Lily's stepmother, had mentioned during her prison visit.

If Lily survived that car accident, it must mean she had known from the beginning. Someone in her inner circle must have betrayed her. Lily even
hinted that she had a backup plan, meaning she was fully aware of everything.

Ariana turned to Eric, whostood nearby with a concerned expression.

Eric noticed her intense gaze and asked, "Is everything okay? Who were you talking to?"


Shaking away her suspicion, Ariana told herself that Eric couldn't have betrayed her. He loved her, and she was certain of it. Even if he didn't support all her plans, he'd stuck by her because of his feelings. There was no way he'd align himself with her enemies.

She walked up to him and stopped right in front of him. "She's still alive?"

"Who?"

"Lily. She's alive. I just spoke to her-I couldn't believe it."

"She didn't die? That's impossible. The car caught fire; it burned to ashes."

"Yes, but she wasn't inside."

"Then how did she find out about what we planned?" Eric asked though a part of him felt relieved that Lily was alive. If she were truly dead,Ariana would face far greater troubles once Alexander and her grandfather learned the truth.


"Perhaps there's a traitor," Ariana muttered, her gaze fixed on Eric.

"You think I'm a traitor?"

"You and everyone else are suspects," she said, looking him straight in the eye.
"You're unbelievable! I can't belleve you'd even consider suspecting me,"Eric replied, hurt by her accusation.

"What else am I supposed to think?" Ariana shouted. "Lily didn't die, so that means someone who knew about my plans either you or the others-leaked the information to her. Now I'm back to square one!" She ran her fingers through her hair, visibly frustrated.

"If you're going to accuse me, then I'll leave right now. I won't be involved in any of this anymore."

"Fine,you can leave!" she snapped.


Eric headed for the door but paused before leaving. "For the record,I never supported your actions, but I would never betray you. Remember that," he said before walking out.

Ariana slumped onto the couch, overwhelmed by frustration.

Now that everything had spiraled out of control, she had no choice but to activate Plan B. The problem was she had no idea what Lily was planning.She had to be more prepared than ever.

Determined,she stood and went to meet her men at their secret hideout.

Meanwhile, Carolina, who had been keeping a close watch on her daughter's activities, couIdn't shake the feeling that Ariana was at the center of all the chaos. She decided to follow her secretly to intervene before things got worse.

Elsewhere, news spread that there were no casualties in the car explosion.

Alexander, who had been frantic for the past two hours,felt slightly relieved but remained tense.
"Have any of the men reported back yet?" he asked.

"Not yet, Alexander. We need to wait a bit longer. We just sent them out,"Ethan replied.

"What do you mean by 'not too long' Ethan?" Alexander snapped.

"Calm down. At least we know she wasn't in the vehicle," Ethan reasoned.

"But she's still missing!"

Ethan ran a hand through his hair, frustrated. "Have you tried her number again? Also, maybe we should contact her grandfather-what's his plan for her disappearance?"

Ethan's words sparked an idea. Alexander quickly dialed Lily's number.and to his surprise, it went through. Relief washed over him.

"It's ringing," he said, his voice steadier.

Ethan moved closer and sat down, waiting to hear what would happen next.


Lily saw the incoming call and hesitated. She had intended to call Alexander herself, but now that he was calling first, she felt at a loss for words.


Alexander tapped his fingers impatiently on the table, waiting for her to answer.

Gathering her thoughts, Lily picked up and placed the phone to her ear."Alexander."

Hearing her voice instantly calmed him. "Lily, where are you?"
She hesitated. "Somewhere. But I'Il be back at the family mansion soon.I already called Grandfather and informed him. I was going to call you, but you called first."


"Your vehicle was targeted. How did you know what was going to happen?



"Michael was with me. He detected it in time."

"Fine. Tell me where you are. I'll come and get you myself."

"I'm already on my way home, Alexander. Michael and Matthew are with me."


"Where were you going so early in the morning? And why were they with you?" Alexander demanded.

Lily didn't know howv to answer.

"Answer me, Lily!"

Ethan watched in astonishment at Alexander's commanding tone. Just a few hours ago, Alexander had been panicking like a helpless child, but now he was exuding authority.


Suppressing a laugh, Ethan listened as Lily replied, "I'l explain everything.Alexander. I'll be back soon."

"I want you at our home, not your grandfather's. The moment you return,come straight to me and Viola. Understood?"

"Yes, I'll come home."

Alexander ended the call and immediately checked the tracking device connected to her number.
"She's far from the city," Ethan noted, observing the screen.

"She's hiding something," Alexander muttered1.standing up.

"Yes, but since she said she is on her way then you should wait for her to get back".

"No, I'm going there," Alexander said firmly.

"There are a lot of negative rumors going around about her. Shouldn't you stay back to take care of them?" Ethan asked cautiously.

"I do not care about those rumors; they are all lies," Alexander replied coldly.


"I never said they were true,but they are still rumors," Ethan pressed.

Alexander thought about what Lily had told him about being with
Matthew and Michael. "Whoever tried to kill her is spreading these rumors.
The same person caused the accident that almost killed Lily and Viola and left my mother in a coma," he said through gritted teeth.

"I have a bad feeling, Alexander, and I don't like it when I feel this way,like something is about to go wrong," Ethan said, his voice tense.

"So what do you plan to do?"

"Get the men ready. We're heading to her location," Alexander commanded without hesitation.

Ethan nodded, understanding the seriousness of the situation.

Lily was surprised that Alexander no longer brought up the rumors spreading about her. Does this mean he didn't believe them? she wondered,feeling a sense of relief.
Although he had been authoritative on the phone, she was glad that he wanted her and Viola to come back home.

"Was that Alexander?" Michael asked.

"Yes." she replied softly.

"He must be relieved to find out you're okay," Michael said.

"Yes, and he wants me to come back home soon with Viola," Lily said,her voice lighter.

"This means he didn't believe the rumors and won't come for my head anymore.," Michael joked with a slight smile.

"Of course, Alexander knows me better than anyone else. He knows those photos were photoshopped," Lily said confidently.

Michael seemed to relax. “Ariana should be on her way here, right?”

“Yes, she's already on her way, but she's still about an hour away,"Matthew confirmed.

Matthew's assurance didn't fully calm Lily. “Matthew, you said no one would be able to track my location, right?”

“Yes,why?”
"I just have a feeling that Alexander might have tracked my location while on the call with him," Lily admitted, her anxiety creeping back in.
Matthew smirked slightly, trying to ease her nerves. "Of course, he would.

The man's madly in love with you."

--.-to find my location,
right?”

"Not a chance," Matthew said confidently."I used layers of back codes to block anyone from accessing your location, no matter the device they use."

Lily let out a sigh of relief.

The only people who had her location were her grandfather's men,who were already on standby for Plan B. She was certain her grandfather wouldn't give Alexander the location, and she had already told him she was on her way home.

But unknown to Lily, Alexander was already on his way to her location.
###Chapter 140

Arina headed to the location after meeting with her men. She did not know what Lily had planned, so she had to bring backup. A good number of her men were following her to that place.

Unknown to her, Carolina had hidden herself in one of the vehicles.

At the location. Lily had already prepared herself. She had planned a lot for Arina, and the whole world was going to witness a part of what was going to happen today. Arina was not going to escape all this.

About an hour later, Arina and her men arrived at the place. Their cars were parked on the side of the expressway, and through the directions she was given, they were supposed to enter the woods.

Why would Lily bring her to the middle of nowhere? Was her plan to kill her and feed her to the wild animals?

Arina could not tell what her plan was, but she was glad she was prepared.It was either she killed Lily or Lily killed her-both of them could not leave here alive.

A call came, andit was Lily.

"Hello, Lily," she said once she picked up the call.

"Make your way to the woods at your left," Lily instructed.

Arina turned to the opposite side from where the car was parked.She looked at her surroundings, and it was dead silent. It would soon get dark.
She thought about what Lily might have planned while waiting for her.Deep down, she felt nervous. She always remembered what Bella told her:
Lily wasn't someone to mess with.

But Arina was determined.

After making plans with her men, she instructed them to quietly follow her behind. After 10 minutes of walking inside the woods on her own,she crossed to the other side and entered the woods. Her men followed her after ten minutes, while unknowingly, her mother, Carolina, came down from where she hid inside the back of the SUV and calmly followed behind them.


An hour away was Alexander driving towards the location where they had tracked Lily. On his way there, he made sure to call his mansion to check if Lily was home so he could turn around and head back, but Clara informed him that she was not home yet.

He had also called Caleb, his grandfather-in-law, but Caleb had lied, saying Lily was at the family house. Doubting the old man's words,Alexander called the men monitoring the family residence, and they said they hadn't seen any sign of the lady boss arriving.

This filled Alexander with rage. One thing he hated was deceit. Lily had not returned home as promised, and her grandfather was lying for her.Now he was sure she was still at the location they had tracked before.

"Drive faster," Alexander said to David, who immediately sped up the vehicle.

Back in the woods, after walking for a good 30 minutes, Arina saw Lily standing in the middle of two huge trees with a full-body suit on. Arina looked at what she herself was wearing and was glad she had worn a body suit too, with a gun strapped around her waist.
The sound of someone approaching made Lily turn, and she saw that Arina was finally here.

"Good,you made it," Lily said to her.

"Well, we have to finish this once and for all," Arina replied.

A few meters away, in an underground base, Caleb, Michael, and Matthew were watching Arina and Lily through a monitor. They had cameras around the woods and even at the expressway, which was how they knew that Arina had arrived.

They had men stationed arouand where Lily was with Arina. They knew Arina came with some of her men, and Carolina had come behind.

"Send two men to look for Arina's mother and bring her here," Caleb instructed.

"Sir. do you think she might be trouble?"

"Not just that. It will make Lily think twice about doing what she plans to do with Arina. One thing about Lily is that she wouldn't want to involve a family member. Her mother doesn't know all she's done, so she's innocent,"Caleb said.

Matthew and Michael agreed with him, so they immediately sent two men to bring Carolina here, even if it was by force. But bringing her here would also mean letting Carolina listen to everything her daughter had done and seeing how the whole country would hear as well.

"Agreed, let's end this. You've done a lot of wrong to me, Arina,all because you want Alexander," Lily said.
"Right now, what I want most is to see you gone for good." Arina said.
and as she spoke, the hidden cameras were recording her words.

"I'want to see you try. You haive to fight me, and if you win, I'll conclude that maybe I didn't deserve Alexander, but you do," Lily urged her.

Arina smiled. She had learned martial arts growing up, and after waking up from her coma, she spent the two years she used to recover also practicing martial arts. She had dlone a full investigation on Lily during that time and found no record of Lily learning martial arts. She was confident she would win.


"Alright, if you say so," Arina said as she prepared herself by exercising her muscles.

Lily was already prepared, so she didn't waste time. She immediately headed toward Arina with her fist in the air and punched her in the face.sending Arina to the floor and catching her off guard.

Arina winced in pain and looked up at Lily, who had an angry look on her face and was breathing hard. Lily was so angry that her breathing was unstable.

Arina smiled and immediately stood up. "You took me by surprise."

"I have no time for prepping. Let's get on with it," Lily responded.

Lily clenched her fists, and Arina did the same. In less than five seconds.they collided with each other.

Caleb watched the fight on the screen in the underground hideout. He smiled because he was confident that his granddaughter was going to win.He had taught her martial arts from a very young age,and when she and her sister became teenagers, he had the best martial arts teacher in the country train them in secret. No records were kept. so Arina definitely
thought she would wvin.

The two men who went to bring Carolina came back with her unconscious.

"Why is she unconscious?" Caleb asked as he stood and walked toward Carolina,who was laid on the couch.


"The old lady was strong-headed. We had no other choice but to sedate her."


Caleb sighed. "Now how is she supposed to watch the drama?"

"The drug will make her sleep for only 30 minutes or so," Matthew said.

"Let's hope the best part won't be over by then. I want her to see what her daughter is like."

Caleb walked back to his seat and sat down. He watched the screen with a smile on his face.

Although Arina knew how to fight, she was no match for his granddaughter,who had already given her a few bruises on the side of her lip.

Back to the two ladies-the fight went on, with Lily punching Arina in the stomach, which made her yelp.

Arina looked at Lily in surprise, with a questioning look as to how she knew how to fight so well. Seeing the look on her face, Lily smiled.She knew what was going through Arina's head.

"You must be wondering how I'm this good,right?"

Arina struggled to get up while wincing in pain. She had only managed to stand when Lily knocked her down again.
###Chapter 141

"That's my granddaughter!" Caleb was overjoyed as if he were watching a thrilling wrestling match.

Matthew and Michael were relieved that it was not Nuella who had been knocked down instead.


"Now it's time to move on to the next stage," Caleb grinned.

Back to the ladies

Lily bent down and stared at the unconscious Arina lying on the ground.This was just the beginning.

She had hit Arina so hard that she was almost unrecognizable.

Soon,some of her grandfather's men rushed to her side after they had finished fighting off the men who had come with Arina.

"Ma'am, are you okay..." one of the men began to ask. but stopped mid-sentence when he saw the person on the ground was Arina, and that the madam seemed perfectly fine without a single scratch. They all sighed in relief.

"What do you want us to do with her, ma'am?"

"Carry her and bring her along," Lily ordered.

Lily began walking toward the next location, and the men followed her.carrying Arina.
The men Arina had brought with her were lying unconscious nearby,their bodies tied with chains to prevent them from escaping when they woke up.
Lily made her way to a wide open field deep in the woods. The place had once been covered in thick bushes, but she had ensured it was cleared to make room for what was about to happen.

She glanced around, noticing that all the hidden cameras had been perfectly positioned.


"Place her here," Lily instructed, and the men dropped Arina onto a bed of sand.


"Give me the injection," she commanded, and one of the men handed her a syringe.

Without hesitation, she injected Arina with it. This injection would make her wake up in about five minutes.

Caleb,who was watching all of this from a secret basement, could tell that the interesting part was about to begin. He wanted Carolina to witness what was going to happen.

"Hasn't her mother woken up yet?"


"She might have."

"Bring her here; I want her to witness what's about to unfold." Caleb said with a smirk.

The men hurried to the room where Carolina had been kept sleeping, only to find that she had already woken up, confused about her surroundings.

"You're up," one of the men said.

"Who are you, and where am I?" Carolina demanded.

"You'll find out where you are soon," one of the bodyguards replied before
dragging her out of the room and taking her to where Caleb and the others were.


"Who are you? Let go of me, young man!" Carolina screamed.

Caleb turned when he heard her voice.

Carolina fell silent when she saw Caleb. She recognized him immediately.There was no one in A City who didn't know Caleb Blake-the ruthless old man who was the chairman of the Blake Empire.

But she couldn't understand why they were holding her there or why Caleb Blake was involved.

"You must have some questions. Come, have a seat. The show is about to get even more interesting," he said, looking at the screen. Carolina's gaze shifted to the monitor, and she gasped when she saw her daughter lying on a bed in the middle of the forest, bathed in light. Lily stood close to her.Her daughter had bruises on her face.

"So, Lily was the person she was coming to meet," Carolina thought to herself. But why? That was something she still couldn't figure out.

"You should sit down if you want an explanation," Caleb said.

Carolina walked towards the chair near Caleb and sat down, her gaze fixed on him, waiting for an explanation.

"So here's the story," Caleb began, making sure to tell Carolina everything that Arina had done, backed up by proof. By the time he finished.Carolina was crying. Her fears had come true. She had suspected that her daughter was behind many of the things that had happened, but she hadn't known it was this bad. Now Lily was getting her revenge.
"Don't cry just yet, madam. You should wait a little while longer,because in about half an hour, you'll be crying a bucket," Caleb said seriously. "That is, after your daughter confesses with her own mouth everything she has done."

But Carolina kept crying.

"You should be glad we haven't killed her yet. But just so you know, she's going to jail." Caleb added with-a deadly expression that made Carolina shiver.


Caleb was right. She needed to wait for her daughter to confess her crimes.So. at that thought, Carolina wiped her tears and sat up straight to watch what was about to unfold.

Back in the forest,

Lily saw that ten minutes had passed, so she grabbed a bottle of water,opened it, and poured it on Arina to wake her up.

Arina's eyes shot open. She gasped for air and looked around,realizing she was lying on a bed placed on the sand. She glanced around more carefully and saw Lily standing nearby.

"You're finally awake. Now we can get to the real business," Lily said with a smile.

"Don't worry about your men," she added, "I made sure they were beaten and tied up."

Arina was shocked. She no longer had any backup. This meant Lily was going to kill her for real. But even with that knowledge. Arina smiled and got up to face Lily.
Lily smiled in response. "I love your courage."

Arina stood up, closing the distance between them. "Do your worst," she challenged.

"Of course, I will," Lily replied calmly as she walked to a chair not far from them and sat down.


Arina crossed her arms, glarng at her.

"Take a seat," Lily said, as one of her grandfather's men brought a chair for Arina.


"Thank you," Arina said without fear. She had no regrets for what she had done. If she had the chance, she would kill Lily right now. Despite Lily having beaten her in their previous fight and knocking her unconscious,Arina was not afraid of her. She would never be afraid of Lily-over her dead body would she fear her.

"You made a mistake by daring to go against me and my family," Lily said.her voice cold.

Arina rolled her eyes. "If I get the opportunity, I'll do even worse, Lily.Don't test me."

Lily clenched her fist, feeling the urge to hit Arina right then, but decided to remain calm. What she wanted now was for Arina to confess her crimes in her own words.

"Tell me, Arina. I want to hear the story of how you met Alexander," Lily demanded.

Arina relaxed against the chair, excited to tell the story. She shared everything with Lily, who listened carefully.
"You see, Lily, I love Alexander so much that I'd do anything for him.You can call it obsession if you want to."

"So,you're so obsessed with Alexander that you were willing to kilI anyone who got in the way. You knew he was happily married and already had a child, but you still tried to destroy his family. You tried to kill me and my daughter."


Arina let out an evil laugh. "Ha ha ha ha."

"Yeah, Lily, what really pains me is that you're still alive. If I had my way,I'd kill you right now, and that way, Alexander would finally look my way.



Lily smiled, feeling a sense of satisfaction.

Unbeknownst to Arina, hidden cameras were broadcasting everything live on all channels across the country. Her grandfather had arranged for every TV station to air it at that very moment.

People walking the streets and sitting in their homes all over the country,even on social media, were watching the broadcast in shock. Many gasped when Arina admitted that she had tried to kill Lily and would even kill her if given the chance.

Carolina,who was watching this from the secret hideout, had her hand covering her mouth. Although Caleb had already told her everything her daughter had done, hearing it directly from Arina's own mouth was even more shocking. What hurt her most was that Arina showed no remorse. In fact,she was determined tokill Lily if she had the chance.

Caleb, on the other hand, was satisfied. Seeing Arina finally admit to her wrongdoings pleased him.
If Arina had known that the entire country was watching, she would have kept her mouth shut.

Meanwhile, Alexander had long arrived in the area where Lily's phone was located, but he couldn't pinpoint exactly where she was in the woods.There were too many bushes and tall trees around. He suspected the tracker might have detected an incorrect location. He had called home to check if Lily and his daughter had arrived, but was told they hadn't. His men working on the Blake house also confirmed that Lily had not arrived,and his daughter was still inside.

Alexander kept wondering whether she was somewhere in the forest or somewhere else when he saw the live video of Arina admitting that she would kill Lily.

Alexander froze, watching the video. His anger was undeniable, and he felt as though he might tear Arina apart if she were near him. He looked around, unsure of where to go.

From the video, it was clear that they were in the forest, but where exactly,he couldn't figure out.

"So Arina has been behind everything that's been happening?" Ethan asked in shock.

"I should have known," Alexander growled,his teeth gritted.

Seeing Alexander's expression, Ethan realized he was ready to kill Arina if she were in front of him at that moment.

"I think we should stay calm. Looks like Lily is handling everything just fine," Ethan said, but immediately regretted it as Alexander grabbed him by the throat.
"Say that again," Alexander's eyes burned with rage.

Ethan tried to speak but couldn't.

"You mean I should just sit here and do nothing while Lily is out there with Arina, who has already tried to kill her?!" Alexander shouted.

"Over my dead body will I stay here and just watch this on live TV."
###Chapter 142

Seeing that Ethan was about to be strangled to death by him, Alexander freed him.


Ethan gasped for air and became pissed. He immediately stood with all his strength and gave Alexander a punch.

Alexander, who was not expecting it, staggered back but regained his composure. Before he could retaliate, Ethan gave him a second punch that landed him on the ground.

He was shocked. He was always the one punching, but this time Ethan had retaliated, which he did not expect.

"I always do everything for you and tolerate your nonsense, but where I draw the line is where you try to strangle me to death. From today onwards, we are not friends. I do not see any reason why I should abandon my own business to always be with you and help you."

Ethan was panting in anger. “As much as I want to help Lily in this situation, I will be leaving."

Ethan got in his car and drove off.

Alexander, who had already gotten up from the floor, stood and watched as he drove off. All his men stood a few distances away and could not do anything because they were shocked that, for the first time. Ethan attacked back.

Alexander admitted to himself that he had done Ethan wrong. He had allowed his anger to take control of his head. When the issue of Ariana was over, he was going to settle his issue with Ethan. One thing he was
not going to risk was the friendship he had with Ethan.

Alexander wiped the blood at the corner of his lip, then turned to his men."Send more men to this place," he instructed one of his men.

"Right away,boss."

"The rest of you share yourselves into a group and head into the woods."

He was going to look for where Lily was in the forest. He would make sure Ariana paid for all she had done.

Now he understood why Lily's grandfather had been calm all this while-because he knew Lily's plans all along. He had wondered why he was not worried about his granddaughter's whereabouts, not knowing the old man knew all along.

Both Lily and her father had played him. Although he was not surprised by the old man's actions, he was surprised by the fact that Liy had kept all this awway from him, even going to stay in the Blake residence because of this.

He could put two and two together to know that was her reason for moving to her family residence. What had happened had happened. Now that he knew, he needed to be there with her.

He was going to make sure that Ariana regretted ever waking up from her coma. He was going to make her wish for death instead.

He saw a path into the forest and headed toward it with some of his men with him, while others followed a different direction to look for Lily.

Back to Arina and Lily
Ariana laughed as she told Lily the story of her waking from the coma and how the first thing she thought about was Alexander. She wanted so badly to see Alexander and beg for forgiveness so they could start afresh.

"But what I did not expect was him to be already married with a child.The Alexander I kneww never wanted a child, so him having a child with you made me realize that to get you out of his life, I will need to kill you."

"I had wanted to send you to jail, which was why I planned the demolition of the orphanages and homes of the elderly and less privileged that were overseen by you, which had led to the death of many," Ariana smirked.


She was not even shocked, and this made her mother have a cold chill as she listened. Her daughter had completely gone mad.

She had suspected but kept doubting that she could do such.

What Ariana said led to an uproar in the city and also from the people whose family was lost in the demolition. Some families were buried alive in the houses that were demolished, while some who were rescued had permanent injuries; some could no longer walk.

Tears rolled down Lily's eyes. What Ariana deserved was death, but she would make sure that this family received justice before she slowly killed her while she was in prison.

Alexander kept on watching the live video while walking in the forest to look for where they were.

The police were already sending search parties to look for Ariana because what she was saying there was enough evidence to lock her up.
The families of the people were already going to press charges. even when
it was already dark. To think they had accused Lily and her family of it.and until now, they had hated her for it.

"You killed this many people because you wanted a man who did not want you." Lily said in a calm voice, but her eyes were red with anger.

Ariana nodded, and that led to more uproar from the viewers.

"You could have been sentenced to prison, but unfortunately,you were found not guilty, so 1 decided to kill you and your dlaughter through a car accident. I did not know Alexander's mother would be inside. I was disappointed when I had that you only had a minor injury and your daughter was not even hurt," Ariana said in disdain.

Carolina listened with tears rolling down her eyes. She was shivering at this point.

Hearing what she said made Alexander's anger boil more. He could not wait to locate where they were to give Ariana a piece of his mind.

As he was getting more impatient and agitated, one of his people,who was tracking their location in the forest, immediately rushed to where he was.


"Boss,"

Alexander turned and waited for Max and James to get to where he was."Did you get the location?"

Since it was being broadcast live, then there was a satellite somewhere enabling it, so all they did was track where the signal was coming from.
"Yes, boss, it's directed at the south side," Max pointed in a direction.
Alexander immediately headed in that direction after collecting the signal tracker from Andrew.


They immediately followed behind him after informing other men to head in this direction.


Back to Ariana and Lily

"So, unfortunately, Alexander's mother is still in a coma because of me.I want her to be my mother-in-law, so I hope she gets well soon," Ariana said with a smirk.


"She is out of her mind," Matthew said.

Michael signaled for him to remember that her mother was there. No mother would want their child to be called crazy.

Matthew frowned. Even if Carolina was here, he was sure the woman knew that her daughter had lost it.

"Look, even people online think the same," Matthew said as he showed Michael the comments online from the people watching the livestream.

("SHE IS CRAZY!")

("SHE DESERVES DEATH!!")

("SHE IS EVIL, HOW COULD SHE!!")

("TO THINK I SUPPORTED HER DURING HER BACK AND FOUGHT WITH THE HAYWOODS")

("SHE WILL PAY FOR CAUSING THE DEATH OF MY GRANDMOTHER!!

!”)
This comment was from the child of one of the people who died in the demolition.


Michael and Matthew both sighed. Ariana was surely going to pay.

Carolina, who had been listening to their conversation,felt ashamed.How was she now supposed to start begging for forgiveness from the people her daughter had hurt? Although her daughter would obviously go to prison,it was important for her to still ask for their forgiveness.


"If not that you were smart enough not to have been in that vehicle,you wouldn't be here right now," Ariana said.

Lily's lips curved into a wide smile. As much as she had wanted to kill Ariana at once, she was glad she opted to do it this way.

Ariana frowned when she saw Lily's wide smile. It was then she knew something was wrong. Lily was just sitting there and doing nothing to her,and her men standing a few distances away were not doing anything.

Now she was beginning to think about why they had needed to sit like this and talk about something that Lily already knew.

Ariana then scanned around her and that was when she noticed small red lights in different hidden corners blinking.

"Are those cameras?" she thought to herself, and her heart started beating rapidly. She turned to Lily, who was still smiling.

"Was I on record?" Ariana asked through gritted teeth,but she already knew the answer.

Lily started clapping as she stood up and advanced toward her.
"Thank you, Ariana, for confessing your sins. Now you made everything easy for me," Lily said as she stood in front of her.

"How dare you record me? You think you can be able to use it as evidence against me?" Ariana laughed. "For your information, it will be a waste because the evidence will get lost once it gets to the police."

She said with confidence because she had people in authority who could easily throw away Lily's evidence.

Lily knew this, which is why she opted for live video instead. Now Ariana s confession was in the hands of everyone, so no way would happen.


"Ha ha ha," Lily laughed.

This made Ariana frown.

Lily signaled for one of her men to bring her tablet.

Lily took the tablet and showed Ariana the video of them streaming live right now.

Ariana's eyes widened in shock.

"How dare you!!" Ariana was about to hit Lily when one of her men held her and dragged her away from Lily.

"Let me go, you bastard! She needs to be taught a lesson!!" she screamed.

Lily picked up her phone and sent a text to Matthew to end the live video.

Matthew received the message and immediately proceeded to end the live video. The whole country already saw what they needed to see.
Carolina, seeing her daughter in the state she was in, immediately got up.
"Please take me to where she is."

Matthew looked at Caleb for approval.

Caleb nodded. "Take her to her daughter. Let her say her last goodbyes before her daughter is transferred to prison."

Carolina was taken out of the secret basement to go see her daughter.

Caleb looked at his phone, which was ringing, and was shocked to see who was calling. Peter was calling.

Peter was not in the country and was in a rural environment in another country,so how was he able to call?

Caleb picked up the call. "Yes,son?"

"Father, I just landed in A City and could not believe what I just watched on the news. What exactly has been going on, and why has no one bothered to inform me?" Peter said in worry.

"It's a long story, son. Go to the family home and relax. We will be back soon to explain everything to you."

Peter, knowing that there was no way he could convince his father to tell him anything right now or convince him to reveal their location,just said,"Okay," and hung up the call.

He sat somewhere and thought about all he just heard Ariana confessing in the live video.

Alexander got to where Lily and Ariana were and was just in time to see Ariana collecting the gun from the pants of one of the bodyguards and aiming it at Lily.
"Lily, down!!" he screamed with all his lungs and rushed toward Lily to block Ariana's shot.

Lily looked toward Alexander and then back to Ariana. Before the bullet could hit her, she was covered by someone, and the bullet hit the person instead.
###Chapter 143

Lily was shocked. She looked at the body that shielded hers and was stunned to see that it was Carolina, Ariana's mother.

Ariana screamed, "Nooooo!! Noooo!!! Mother!!!" She dropped the gun and immediately rushed toward her mother, whose body was held by Lily.

She knelt down and shook her mother's body in desperation. "Mother,please wake up!!"

Alexander pulled Lily up to let Ariana hold her mother instead. Lily, still dazed,stared at Alexander.

"Alexander, how...?" she stammered, surprised to see him there.

Blake and the others, who had seen what happened, immediately left the base nearby and rushed to the scene.

"Why would you plan all this without my knowledge?" Alexander demanded.

"I'm sorry. Knowing you, you wouId have done things more rashly," Lily replied.

Alexander sighed, his anger momentarily dissipating as he held her in his arms. Relief swept over him-she was safe.

After a brief embrace, Lily moved toward Ariana,who was crying bitterly over her unconscious mother.
Lily looked at James, who had just arrived with the others, her gaze full of questions. She then turned to her grandfather, Caleb, with the same silent inquiry.
How was Ariana's mother here? Lily questioned them with her eyes.

"We didn't doanything. Her mother followed her here secretly, according to what she said," James explained.


Hearing this. Ariana's cries intensified. It was her fault. Her mother had warned her to stop, but she hnadn't listened, and now her mother lay unconscious because of her.


"All of you have a lot of explaining to do later," Alexander said, casting a sharp look at Lily, Blake, James, and Michael-the latter being someone he particularly disliked.

If Carolina hadn't taken the bullet, Lily would have been the one lying on the ground.

Lily glanced at Alexander. Although they had hugged, she knew it was merely relief that she was unharmed. She could sense the anger simmering beneath. She was certain that after today, Alexander would keep her on house arrest.

"She's still alive, so let's get her to the hospital immediately," Lily said."The bullet didn't hit any vital organs."

Ariana wept uncontrollably.

"Max."

"Yes,boss."

"Seize her," Alexander ordered.

"No, I will take care of Ariana instead," Blake interjected.

Alexander was stopped by Caleb. "You've done your part. Let me do mine.
"Let's not handle it this way, Alexander. The whole country saw what happened here. The police are already searching for her. If we don't hand her over, we'Il face the consequences," Caleb warned.

"After everything she's done, you expect me to just hand her over without torturing her for days?" Alexander growled through clenched teeth.

"You think I don't feel the same after she tried to kill my granddaughter and great-granddaughter because of you?!" Caleb retorted heatedly.

Alexander clenched his fists. "I will take her."

"No, you won't," Caleb countered firmly.

The bodyguards on both sides stood tense,awaiting orders.

Lily, seeing neither man willingto yield, stepped forward. Her grandfather had allowed her to handle things her way, and now that things had unfolded as they had, Ariana had to be handed over to the authorities.

Lily placed a hand on Alexander's clenched fist.

"Alexander, please reconsider. Since things have already gone this way,we have to hand her over to the authorities," she pleaded softly.

"Not when she deserves death," Alexander replied coldly.

"Yes,she deserves death, and she will get what she deserves. We'll make sure of that together."
After a tense pause, Alexander relented. "Fine, do what you want," he muttered before turning to leave, dragging Lily with him.
Caleb scoffed as he watched them leave. "Seize her and take her mother to the hospital," he instructed.

With the matter settled, everyone began leaving the forest one by one.

As they walked, Lily asked Alexander to slow down.

"Alexander, slow down."

He slowed his pace."Why?"

Lily hesitated, then said, "I'm sorry for not telling you."

"You're sorry? You were almost shot, Lily!" he snapped.

She nodded, unable to meet his gaze.

"I called you earlier today, and what did you say? That you'd be home soon with Viola! And here you are!"

Alexander was seething. "You found out who tried to kill you and our child, and you kept it from me. Why?"

Lily remained silent, staring at the ground.

"Look at mae when I'm talking to you!" Alexander demanded.

Lily hesitated but eventually raised her eyes to his angry face.

"Alexander, can we leave here first? It's dangerous. There might be wild animals or snakes, and you know I'm scared of snakes," she said innocently.
Alexander stared at her in disbelief. "Now you're worried about safety?
You didn't think about this when you decided to come here!"
Lily bit her lip.

Alexander sighed, unable to decide how to deal with his stubborn wife.

"Because of this, you've doubled your punishment," he said.

Lily sighed, knowing she had a lot of makeup to do.

They reached the road and got into the car. The drive back to the city would take over an hour.

Gathering her courage, Lily finally said, "Alexander, I was thinking we should stop by the police station where Ariana is being taken to press charges."

"We can do that tomorrow," Alexander replied curtly, focused on his phone.

Lily nodded and fell silent.

That night, they returned to the family residence. But Alexander, unwilling to stay,decided to go back home with Viola.

Viola,who hadn't seen her father in weeks, clung to him tightly,showering him with kisses as he did the same.

Lily, feeling like an outsider, watched them quietly during the drive home.She regretted separating them for so long.

Lost in thought,she received a text from Sarah.

Sarah had been in touch throughout and was relieved everything went smoothly.

"When did the doctors say you're due?" Lily texted.
"In about two weeks," Sarah replied.

"I'can't wait to welcome my godchild." Lily wrote back.

"Me too," Sarah replied.

Unaware of the exchange, Alexander turned to Lily. "Did Sarah know?"

Lily's silence confirmed his suspicion.

"So she knew?"

Lily nodded hesitantly.

Alexander looked out the window, clenching his jaw.

"I needed her help," Lily murmured.

"You needed her help?" he echoed biterly.

"Yes," she admitted.

"Fine. But why didn't you inform me?" he asked, his voice calm to avoid waking Viola.

"Telling you would've tipped Ariana off. You would've confronted her.taken her to a base, and tortured her to death," Lily explained.

"And you think that wouldn't have been the best course of action?"Alexander growled.
Lily sighed. "I thought about the families who lost loved ones in that demolition. They deserve justice, Alexander. I'm sorry for keeping this from you, but I knew how you'd react."
She was right. He would've taken matters into his own hands. But that
didn't mean Ariana would escape his wrath.
###Chapter 144

15 Days Later

In the past 15 days, a lot has happened. First, Sarah has given birth to a beautiful baby boy. Secondly, Arina was already in prison. Thirdly,everyone who was a victim of Arina has pressed charges. Fourthly,Angelina has woken up from her coma but is still in the hospital recovering.

Alexander has placed some restrictions on Lily, and for the past 15 days,the only place Lily was permitted to go wvas the hospital to see Angelina,his mother. She was restricted from going anywhere else. She had a company to run but could only stay home to manage it. She had been a full housewife for the past 15 days. One thing she enjoyed about the punishment given to her was that she could spend a lot of time with Viola,who was so happy that her mommy was home with her.

Lily danced, sang, drew, swam, and did other fun activities with her daughter during these 15 days. She also spent time talking to Sarah on the phone and video calling to see her godson since they could not return yet.Alexander had said they would be moving into their second mansion once the case with Arina was over.

She now had the time to make delicious meals for Alexander whenever he came home from work. Alexander was no longer angry with her;there was no way he would stay angry with her for long because she was the love of his life. Their sex life had gone from a zero to a hundred since she returned home. She had missed her husband so much during their time apart. She always wore see-through nightgowns and laid on the bed waiting for him to return every night from work. Alexander also missed her so much, so he always looked forward to coming home and making
love to his wife.

Sometimes he left work early and returned home to spend time with her and their daughter. There was a sudden peace in their life now that Arina was in prison.


Today was the first and only court trial of Arina. Lily stood in front of the mirror fully dressed in a short black skirt, paired with a suit jacket and stilettos. She looked so beautiful and professional. They had decided that this would be the only trial held for Arina because there was a lot of evidence proving her guilt, as well as the live confession she made.So,she would be tried today and sentenced today.

"Are you ready?" Alexander said as he placed his hand around her waist.

Lily smiled. "Yes, and I'm glad it will be all over today."

"It won't be completely over until I'm sure she's dead," Alexander said.

Lily turned to face him and smiled. "Let's not do that, Alexander. I don't want blood on our hands."

"Blood won't be on your hands, rather blood will be on my hands. Let me be the one to bear the burden. I've always told you that I don't want your hands to be stained," he said while caressing her palm.

He kissed her forehead and then her lips. "I love you so much, Lily."


"I love you too,Alexander."

Alexander hugged her. "I have a surprise for you after thetrial is over."


"Really?" Lily smiled.

"Yes, love," he said as he moved her hair away from her face.
Lily sighed. "I can't wait."

Lily smiled.

They both left the house and headed to the court after leaving Viola with her aunt Sandra.


The court premises were filled with civilians and the families of the deceased persons whom Arina had killed in the demolition. There were posters all around, waved in the air by civilians demanding justice to be served.

Their vehicles stopped in front of the court premises, and Lily and Alexander stepped out after their bodyguards had blocked the reporters from obstructing their path.

Reporters kept taking photographs of the Haywoods and started throwing questions at them. For the past 15 days, reporters had been trying to interview Lily, but all to no avail because she was hardly seen leaving their residence. The only times she did leave, they could not talk to her.

Now was their chance to ask her about what happened that day when Arina's confession was streamedI live. Lily and Alexander kept climbing the staircase without saying anything to the reporters.
The courtroom was already filled by the time they got inside. Lily hugged her father when she saw him. They had been speaking on the phone,but this was the first time she had seen him since he returned to the country.She also went to greet her grandfather and everyone else she knew before sitting down on the front row with Alexander.
Alexander was a very protective husband, as always. He made sure to have the guards close by, even though they were not allowed in the courtroom.
That woman, Arina, was crazy, so anything was possible. She might even have someone helping her outside while she was in prison,so Alexander needed to be protective.

Soon, Arina was brought in with handcuffs, and the families of the deceased started cursing at her.

Lily looked at Arina, who was made to sit at the defendant's table. Arina looked so unkempt, but it was understandable since she had been kept in prison for 15 days.

Arina's eyes met Lily's, and Arina immediately looked away.

"Was she feeling ashamed for all she had done?" Lily thought to herself,but she doubted that was the case with Arina.

Soon, the judges arrived, and everyone stood up. They all took their seats again when the judge signaled for them to.

The case started soon after. After the prosecutor presented all evidence and witnesses spoke, including Lily, Arina was found guilty and sentenced to 5O years in prison.

The families of the deceased sighed in relief. She was going to pay for her crimes, for sure. Lily was glad that she got such a sentence,even if she felt that what Arina deserved was death.

Caleb and Alexander were certainly not satisfied. These were men who ruled the underworld, so following the law in cases like this was not something they normally did. They were only doing things this way because Lily wanted it done this way, to honor the families of the deceased.

They left the court after waiting for Arina to be taken away.
Arina gave no facial expression as she was taken away,so they could not tell what was going through her head.

But Alexander made sure that her every move would be monitored in prison.

Reporters surrounded them the moment they stepped out of the court.
They kept throwing questions, but the bodyguards blocked the reporters to allow their bosses to pass through.

The cars drove to the front of the court, and they gotin.

Alexander and Lily drove out after getting in, while Caleb and his son drove away too in their separate cars.

"Now that justice has been served, can I go ahead with my plan from the onset?" Alexander asked her.

Lily shook her head. "No."

"Why?" He frowned.

"Because she has to serve some time in jail first before anything else."


Alexander sighed in frustration.

Lily smiled before shifting to his side and placing her hand on top of his."Alexandder, you said you have a surprise for me once the caseis over,so where's my surprise?"
Alexander smiled. "I know, which is why we are heading to the airport."


"The airport!" Lily's eyes went wide as she asked.


"Yes,baby."
"Where are we going?"

"You'll see."

"Wait, what about Viola?"


"She's already waiting for us at the airport."

"Really? So I was the only one who did not know about this?"

"Yes. baby, because it's a surprise for you."

Lily smiled, and she couldn't wait because the past few months had been emotionally stressful and depressing. She anticipated what the surprise would be.
###Chapter 145

Soon, they arrived at the airport, and after checking in, they boarded the private jet.

"Mommy, daddy!" Viola rushed to hug her parents when she saw them.

Lily picked her up, even though she was starting to get heavy. She kissed her on the cheek and forehead.

"What are you and daddy hiding from me?" she asked her daughter, but the 5-year-old Viola just laughed.

"So,you both are keeping secrets now?" Lily said jokingly.

"It's a surprise for you, mummy! You're going to love it, trust me!" Viola said excitedly.

"It's our little secret, a father and daughter secret," Alexander added.

Lily rolled her eyes but couldn't hide her happiness. Seeing how excited her daughter was made her feel certain that it would be something she'd love, something she wouldn't expect.

Soon, they settled down on the private jet, and it took off for a destination that Lily was still unaware of.
About 30 minutes into the flight, Lily laid on Alexander's chest andfell asleep.
Alexander stared at his beautiful wife, who was peacefully sleeping,and then at his daughter. A smile spread across his face. These two were the best things that ever happened to him, and he couldn't imagine his life without them. This was one reason why he was so determined to make
sure Ariana was never a threat again-because even in prison, he felt his family would still be indanger.

Before long, they arrived at the island where Alexander had built a large resort. Lily was taken aback when she saw the place. She knew Alexander had been working on the resort but didn't realize it was already finished and fully operational. The resort looked busy with guests arriving and staff hustling to attend to them.

Lily was in awe of the scale of the resort. The land area was vast, and it stretched all the way to the mountain. From where she stood,she could see large private apartments beneath the resort, close to the mountain.

"Alexander, this place is so massíve! This resort can house thousands of families coming for holidays?" Lily exclaimed.

Alexander nodded. "You like it?"


Lily nodded enthusiastically.

Viola was holding both of her parents' hands as they walked toward the reception area.

"I built it for us. Although it's a resort, we have our own private suite."

Lily leaned in and gave him a kiss. "Thanks, baby. I love the surprise,"she smiled.

If this was the surprise, then Alexander had certainly succeeded in surprising her. It felt like paradise, with the distant mountain providing water and beautiful flowers everywhere. There was even a lake, a golf course, and other outdoor activities. The resort had everything, and Lily loved it.
Alexander shook his head. "This isn't the surprise, you'll see it in the evening."

"Huh?" Lily asked,surprised.

If this wasn't the surprise, then she couldn't imagine what it could be. She looked at Viola, but her little girl was grinning from ear to ear. Lily should have known by now that both father and daughter were partners in crime.

Lily realized that there was no way she would know until the surprise was revealed. It wouldn't be long until nightfall, and then she would find out.

They toured part of the resort for an hour, and Lily was in awe every time she saw something fantastic.

"This resort is in your name and Viola's," Alexander suddenly said.

Lily turned to him in surprise. "Really?"

"Yes, whose name other than yours and Viola's would be here?"

Earlier, he had said he built it for them, but she hadn't realized he meant that it wvas solely in their names. "Alexander, you mean it's only in our names?"

"Yes, baby. Why are you so surprised?" he asked, unable to understand why she hadn't expected this. She should have known by now that this was something he was capable of doing.
"Wow, Alexander, this place is so big! It's like a mini-town! It has everything, including a clinic, stores where different things are sold, and the local market is nearby. I thought this place was built with a partnership from some other corporation you were working with."
That's what she nad assumed-that trey weren t the sole owners. But now, it seemed like they were, especially if he could put only their names on it.

"No, babe, there's no way I'd let anyone else own even 1% of this place."

Lily hugged him and kissed him passionately. "Thank you, baby! I love it!"She was so excited. If they were the sole owners of such a massive project,it meant Alexander must have poured his life savings into it because a resort like this, made with fine materials and timeless designs, would cost a fortune.

Though she was thrilled, as his wife, she felt the need to say something."What if we end up needing partners, love?" she asked, concerned that he might have invested all his life savings and might not have any more personal finances left.

Alexander wrapped his arm around her waist. "It's like you forgot you're married to the youngest and richest billionaire in this city."

Lily smiled. "No, I didn't forget, but..."

"But nothing. You don't need to worry. I only invested the money my grandfather left me as an inheritance, not my personal fortune."
"Your grandfather's inheritance was that much?" Lily was shocked.

"Yes, it was. I was shocked too. I wondered why he had such a large amount in a trust fund instead of investing it. He even left me a letter explaining everything, and after reading it. I understood why. I also liquidated some of his overseas properties that we wouldn't be needing.That's how I got the funds for this project. I was surprised when it was enough for what was required. Many of the exterior and interior designs
were handcrafted."

Lily was in awe. She had no idea about this, but she was happy that Alexander had made such good use of his grandfather's inheritance.

"Thank you for building this place, baby. I love it," she said, her heart full of gratitude.

Alexander nodded. "You're welcome. Come on, let's head to our suite."

Their suite looked like a mini-mansion, and Lily absolutely loved it.


"You love it?"

"Yes, baby, I do." Lily said, in awe of the beauty. It had a perfect touch for a resort.

"Come, let me show you the bedroom."

"Okay," Lily agreed, but not before glancing at Viola. who was playing with her nannies in the garden, surrounded by their best bodyguards.
They stepped into the room, and Lily loved it immediately. "Alexander,this is my style."

"Yeah, I know, that's why I made sure it was done this way."

Alexander wrapped his arms around her waist. "Why don't we make use of the spacious bed now?"

Lily blushed. "But Alexander, Viola is just outside."


"She has the nannies and guards."

"I know, but what if she starts looking for us?"
"Don't worry. The room is soundproof, and the door is closed." Alexander assured her.

"You're sure nothing will spoil this moment?"

"Yes, baby." Alexander replied, his mind focused only on her.

"Okay," Lily said before wrapping her arms around him and kissing him.Alexander deepened the kiss, and soon, they were both in bliss.

Meanwhile, outside. Viola had played for 30 minutes before realizing her parents weren't around. When she asked, she was told they were busy.

After growing bored of playing, Viola was shown to her room,which she loved. She wished she could visit her parents' bedroom, but since they were busy, she decided to wait and see it later, after taking a nap.
###Chapter 146

Alexander lay on one side of the bed while staring at the beauty in front of him. She was sleeping so peacefually and looked so beautiful that he couldn't take his eyes off her. He loved this woman so much with every fiber of his being; he never thought he could love someone this much. He never imagined that one day he would love Lily this deeply.

He remembered the first time he met her. She had quietly walked into his study, and the only way he noticed her presence was when he caught a whiff of her scent. He had been busy going through some documents and didn't even glance at her, despite sensing her presence.

He had waited for her to say something, but she greeted him with silence.That made him furrow his brow because others who came in before her had done one or two silly things just to get his attention and make him notice them.

He had asked himself, "Didn't she come here voluntarily to be his wife?Then why was she acting so distant?" His own question made him frustrated because, realistically, he wasn't even wooing her. It was then that he realized she had knocked before entering, and he mentally kicked himself for being so dense. Of course, she knew he knew she was in the room.

Thinking back on that moment made him chuckle.

It was after that realization that he slowly looked up at her. His breath had hitched for a moment, but at the time, he had brushed it off. It was then that he noticed the presence of Mark in the room, and his ears had tuned out everything Nathan had said. He was busy studying the looks and mannerisms of the lady in front of him.
He didn't know what was going through his mind when he blurted out,“She will do." He had accepted her to be his wife without a second thought.

He didn't realize it at the time, but he had fallen in love with her at first sight. He had lied to himself until his love for her became undeniable after months of being together.

Alexander smiled as he remembered this. He would forever remain in love with this woman, even until death. He was ready to do anything to keep her safe; she was the air he breathed. He kissed her gently on the cheek.

"Tonight, I'm going to do the one thing I should've done a long time ago.baby," he smiled as he imagined how she would react to his surprise.

Night fell, and soon everything was set up for the surprise he had for Lily.

Lily had woken up two hours ago and had gotten ready. She also went to her daughter's room to help her get ready as well.

"Give Mommy a kiss," Lily said, bringing her cheek close, and Viola gave her a big kiss on both cheeks.

"I love you, mommy."

"I love you too,my pretty princess."

Lily picked Viola up and swung her around, which made Vioa laugh happily. She loved it when her mother did this.
"Madam, the boss said I should come take both of you to the location."


"Okay, Viola, let's go."
Viola happily took her mother's hand, and they headed out of the suite.then got into the Porsche car waiting outside. Guards were surrounding
them as they got into the cars behind them.

Soon, the car headed to the location.

Lily kept staring outside as the car drove them, even though the resort had its own road. The view was breathtaking, and she had never seen anything like it. The resort was alive with activity. There were outdoor and indoor clubs, and the overall atmnosphere was lively. She loved the work Alexander had done here.

She wasn't sure what Alexander's surprise was, but she made sure to dress for the occasion, wearing something that would match the resort's theme. She wore a milk-colored silk gown with an open back and a V-neck. She let her hair flow freely because Alexander liked it that way.

She was so excited, and she could tell that Viola, who already knew everything, was even more excited. That made Lily more impatient.

Eventually, they arrived at a place that looked like a restaurant. It was large,with a two-story building.

Lily was in awe of how beautiful it looked on the outside. This resort really felt like its own town. She couldn't stop being impressed by it.

She got out of the car with Viola holding her hand.

"Let's go inside, mummy, daddy must be waiting for us," an excited Viola said.

Lily nodded, and soon they both headed inside the restaurant.

Inside, the restaurant was empty, and Lily looked around, trying to spot Alexander.
"Ma'am, let's head to the rooftop."

"The rooftop?" Lily asked, surprised.

"Yes, ma'am," the bodyguard replied.

Lily nodded, and they began climbing the wooden stairs. The building was two stories high, so they had to climb all the way to the top.

Lily held Viola's hand all the way to the top. When they reached the top.there was just a door that separated them from entering the rooftop.

Lily couldn't hear any voices or sounds coming from the rooftop,but her excitement was building.

"Madam,you1 can go in now," the bodyguard said, and Lily nodded.

She slowly placed her hand on the doorknob and pushed it open, only to be greeted by a large rooftop that made her gasp in surprise.

"Surprise!" an excited scream followed, and Lily's eyes widened when she saw everyone she knew in the place. They had all come out of their hidden spots and surprised her.

"How is it?" she was speechless.

Grandma Helen was here, along with Michael, Matthew, her grandfather.her father, Sandra, Alina, her assistant, and some of Alexander's close friends she had met over the years. The entire place wwas beautifully decorated with music playing in the background, and just as Lily was about to ask for Alexander, he suddenly spoke, and his words made her freeze in her spot.

"Will you marry me?"
She slowly turned to her right where his voice came from, and there he was,kneeling down in front of a large sign that read "MARRY ME AGAIN,LILY."


Lily looked at the ring in his hand, and she became emotional. Their marriage had started as a contract marriage, and although the contract had ended, they still hadn't had a proper wedding, something she had always wished for.


"Loving you was something I never thought would happen, but here I am.madly in love, like a madman. One thing I don't ever want to do in this life is lose you. I won't survive it if I were to lose you, Lily. So please.marry me so we can live the rest of our lives together. I brought our families here today to witness this and to show you how much you mean to me. I want us to have all kinds of weddings-church weddings.traditional weddings, everything. I want us to be married in the eyes of the law, in the eyes of God, and n the eyes of man."

"Say yes, mummy!" Viola screamed excitedly. Now, her parents were going to have a proper wedding, and she would be in their wedding photos.

"Say yes!!" Everyone else screamed, excited for the day. Even Caleb was excited. Though he and Alexander still had their differences, he knew one thing: Alexander was the best man for his granddaughter, and over the years,he had come to accept that.

Lily, still crying, rushed toward Alexander. "Yes, I will marry you again and again, Alexander."
Alexander placed the ring on her finger and stood up to hug her. Then,they both kissed.

Everyone clapped happily.
She had never expected such a surprise from Alexander.

They kissed deeply, without a care in the world. Their love for each other was something only the two of them could fully explain.
###Chapter 147

4, Months Later

Lily smiled and giggled in her sleep, having the most beautiful dream she had ever had in her life. After facing many life challenges, for the first time in years, she was able to enjoy such a peaceful sleep with such a beautiful dream.

She had gone to sleep with so much excitement and joy in her heart that it felt like her heart would burst from the overwhelming happiness.

She was busy enjoying the world of her dreams, rolling around like a child in bed when her sweet slumber was suddenly interrupted.

“Wakey Wakey, it's time to get up, Lily. I know you're living in dreamland right now, but you've got to wake up, because today's your big day!" Sarah said, unable to contain her laughter when she saw Lily frown in her sleep.

Lily slowly opened her eyes and rolled them at Sarah. “Can't you just let me be?”

“I wish I could, but if you don't get up now, you're going to be late for your wedding."

Lily smiled at the reminder that it was her wedding day, but she still felt like sleeping a bit more. “Can't you just let me sleep?" Lily groaned.
“I wish I could, but Alexander would definitely have my head if I don't make sure you're at the church on timne for your wedding."
Lily smiled at the mention of Alexander's name, even giggling as she shook her legs like a child.
Sarah noticed her reaction and remembered seeing Alexander get into a vehicle last night two houses away in the estate when she had stepped outside for some fresh air after putting Anthony Jr. to bed. She was certain he had secretly come to see Lily. He had been told he couldn't see her until their wedding day, as that was tradition, but Alexander clearly couldn't sleep without seeing her.

“You think I don't know he came last night to see you?" Sarah said, and the look on Lily's face confirmed Sarah's suspicion.

“Didn't they say it's bad luck?" Sarah asked with a smile.

Lily rolled her eyes. “All that'sjust a myth."

Sarah spanked her lightly.

“Ouch!” Lily groaned in pain.

“I know you're getting married again, but couldn't both of you manage to stay apart for two hours?" Sarah scolded, though still smiling.

“Who says we did?”

“You didn't?” Sarah asked in surprise.

"We kissed a lòt and made promises to each other, but we didn't do the real thing because Alexander wanted our wedding night to be special."

“Awww,that's sweet.”

“Yeah,”Lily giggled.
"Alright, it's time to get ready so you won't be late for your wedding!"Sarah said excitedly, and Lily got up, ready for her day.
The whole house was busy, everyone running around the estate trying to get everything prepared for the big day. Little Viola was also making sure her mother's big day was perfect. She was so excited for today.

Alexander, on the other hand, was at a hotel with his friends Ethan,Richard, and Anthony. They were also doing their part to make sure Alexander was ready.

Alexander was the most excited groom ever. He wanted everything to go perfectly. The traditional rites had already been performed a week ago at the Blake ancestry temple, so today was the church wedding. They would sign the court papers there, and later they would hold a grand party.

Lily and Alexander's wedding was the talkof Country A and neighboring countries. Everyone was tuning in to watch the wedding, as it was going to be broadcast live on TV and the internet.

Alexander wanted everyone to witness this momentous day for him and Lily, which is why it would be aired live for all to see.

2 Hours Later

Lily was fully dressed in a stunning masterpiece. Her gown was made from the finest silk satin that shimmered in the light. The silhouette blended classic and modern styles perfectly, an A-line shape that flowed gracefully to the floor, accentuating her slender figure. The sweetheart neckline framed her delicate collarbones, while the off-the-shoulder sleeves,made of intricate French lace, added a touch of romance and sophistication.

Her face was flawlessly made up to match her entire look.

Sarah,who stood close by, was in awe as they finished dressing Lily.


"You look like a goddess," Sarah said.
Lily smiled; she truly did look like a goddess. She was so beautiful that she almost didn't recognize herself. Her face was glowing,and her heart was overflowing with joy. She gazed at her reflection in the mirror and smiled, but then she recalled everything that had led her to this moment.

She had lost her sisters and fought for justice in their deaths. She had entered into a contract marriage with Alexander and then became pregnant with Viola. Eventually, Alexander came to love her, and their bond had grown stronger. She had battled her stepmother and stepsister, and she had won. Then, just when she thought peace had finally come to her life,Ariana-who was thought to be dead-came back to haunt her.

Ariana had done everything possible to see Lily dead. She had tried to take her life twice and had attempted to frame her for murders that happened in a home for the elderly and less privileged. But despite it all.Lily emerged victorious.

The past four months had brought peace and quiet, along with happiness.

She remembered that a week after Alexander asked her to marry him again,she had gone to visit Ariana in prison-not to gloat or show her how she had won, but to pass a message from Ariana's mother, who was still in the hospital at that time, since Ariana wouldn't be able to visit her.

Lily had sat across from Ariana, separated only by a see-through glass.

"Why are you here?” Ariana, looking unkempt, had asked with a frown.


"I came to pass a message from your mother."

Ariana laughed. "Please, spare me the nonsense. We both know you came to remind me how you won in our war.”
“You must think I'm like you, Ariana. I'm not petty. I've already sought
justice, and now I'm at peace. That includes all the families of those you killed in the demolition."

Ariana fell silent for a moment before locking eyes with Lily. “I'm wondering why you didn't kill me like you said you would. Tell me why?”

"That was what I really wanted, but at the last moment, I couldn't let mny desires overshadow my judgment. I had to think about the people you killed and how their families would want justice."

"I see. So, what message did you bring from my mother?"

“Your mother, when she woke up, told me to tell you to seek forgiveness from all those you've wronged and try to find peace."

Ariana frowned. “So she means I should ask for your forgiveness?"

"And the forgiveness of all those you've wronged, including their families,"Lily added.

Ariana smiled. "Is there anything else?”

"She said that when she fully recovers, she will come to see you."

“Tell my mother not to bother. There will be no need. Tell her I love her and wish her a peaceful life without me in it."

Lily didn't understand why she had said that but simply nodded. Her conversation with Ariana only confirmed that she was unrepentant and would never ask for forgiveness.
Lily stood up, ready to leave, and turned to walk away as the prison guard opened the door for her. But then she remembered something.
She turned around and called out to Ariana, who was being escorted back
to her cell by the guard.

Ariana stopped and turned to listen.

“You should have listened to my stepmother when she toId you not to mess with me," Lily said, knowing about the conversation between Bella and Ariana.


She saw the surprised look on Ariana's face.

"Yes,you won. Now you can live in peace with Alexander and your daughter. I will no longer be in the picture. Rest assured that you will never see me again after today." Ariana smiled a sad smile before being taken away.

Lily didn't think much about what she said at the time, but the next day they received a call that Ariana had committed suicide in prison. It was then that Lily understood why Ariana had made that statement.

Did Lily feel sad? No, but she felt pity for Ariana's mother, Carolina, who had fallen unconscious again upon hearing of her daughter's death. What hurt Carolina the most was the fact that her daughter died a sinner.Ariana never repented or showed any remorse for her actions. She didn't regret her actions-only the fact that she had failed in her plans. Unable to stand being in prison, she killed herself because she felt life wasn't worth living anymore.
If anyone was truly angry about her suicide, it was Alexander. He felt that it was the easy way out. Alexander said that if he had tortured Ariana, she would have begged for her life.
Lily sympathizes with Carolina, who still, to this day, apologizes to the victims on her daughter's behalf.
But despite all this, Lily felt at peace. There was noone left who posed a threat to her or her family.

She was the happiest woman today, and today was her big day.
###Chapter 148

Hingthing Lily was relieved about was that Ariana's blood wasn't on her hands, despite it being what she had initially wanted.

Lily snapped out of her thoughts and smiled at herself in the mirror once more.

"What were you thinking about? You spaced out for a while," Sarah asked.

“Everything I've been through to get to this point," Lily said.

Sarah smiled. “I can imagine. I'm so glad you overcame everything and made it to this special day of yours."

Lily nodded with a smile.

Viola entered the large closet where the two friends were laughing happily."Wow, Mommy,you look so beautiful!" Viola, already dressed,walked around her mother to take in the view.

Lily was in awe when she saw how beautiful her little princess looked in her dress. Viola was wearing a little white princess ball gown.

“And you look even more beautiful, Princess."

"Thank you, Mommy,but you're more beautiful. I spoke to Daddy a few minutes ago, and he said I should be a good daughter and come help my Mommy who's running late," she pouted.
Lily and Sarah gasped. They had been busy admiring Lily's dress and had forgotten how time was slipping by.
“Okay, okay, let's go, let's go!"' Lily said and immediately kissed Viola.
Viola smiled. “Mommy, you look like a goddess in that dress," she said.

Lily smiled because that was exactly what Sarah had said too. "Thank you,baby."


She held Viola's hand and Sarah's as they headed toward the elevator.

Outside the house, there were many cars waiting to take them to the church. Lily would be traveling in the limousine while the others would take the other vehicles.

Everyone she knew was attending the wedding, including the staff. They all got into the cars and headed to the church.

If there was one wedding everyone wanted to attend, it was the wedding of Alexander Kane and Lily Bake. The wedding of two people from two powerful families was the talk of the town.

Dignitaries, millionaires, billionaires, celebrities, and all the socialites wanted to be there for this momentous day.

The church was already filled with luxury cars and guests in stunning outfits. The grand cathedral had towering spires reaching the sky, adorned with intricate stained glass windows casting a beautiful kaleidoscope of colors inside.

Alexander stood outside, welcoming theguests, but his eyes were always on his watch and the gate. The ceremony was set to start soon, but Lily had not arrived yet, and this made him anxious.

“Calm down, Alexander, she'll be here soon," Ethan said.

After the incident in the forest between the two friends. Ethan had vowed to have nothing to do with Alexander again because of the way he had
treated him. He stayed away until two months ago when Alexander came to his office to apologize.


Ethan thought their friendship was over, not believing that someone like Alexander would ever apologize. What surprised him even more was how sincere and emotional the apology had been.

Alexander had told him how much of a good friend he had been and how much he valued their friendship. They had patched things up, and Ethan was gladthey resolved their differences before the wedding because it would have saddened him if he couldn't be there for his friend on this important day.

“I know, but I can't help it.”

Ethan didn't think Alexander would be this nervous, but there was only one person who could make him feel this way-Lily.

Alexander's eyes were still fixed on the entrance when her limousine arrived, and a smile spread across his face.

The guests turned their attention to see the bride as she stepped out of the limousine. It wasn't just any limousine-it was the latest Mercedes model.

The reporters and cameramen focused on the bride.

Viola was the first to step out as the little bride, and everyone marveled at how beautiful she looked.

Then the bride emerged, and everyone stood in awe of her stunning gown.The cameramen snapped photos and filmed videos. Even the guests took photos. The event was being broadcast live, so those watching from home could also witness the beauty of her dress. Her wedding gown was a limited masterpiece, crafted by the best seamstress in the world. Every
stitch was meticulously done, and designers were already planning to replicate it, though they knew it could never compare.

She wore a veil, but even so, Alexander could tell she looked like a goddess in that gown. He couldn't take his eyes off the beautiful woman who was about to become his wife.

He slowly walked toward her and took her hand. He was wearing a perfectly tailored, deep navy blue suit, another límited masterpiece.

His suit matched her wedding bouquet, which was a deep blue and white.

He extended his hand, and she took it. “You look like an angel, baby,” he whispered in her ear, causing Lily to smile.

The priest spoke, “You should come in, I'll take it from here,” with a smile.

Alexander nodded and began walking inside, but not before glancing back at his bride.

The other guests who had just arrived also headed inside, pausing to admire the bride's dress once more.

Viola was excited, holding her small bouquet as she prepared to be the little bride who would walk ahead of her mother.

“Are you ready?" her father asked, and she nodded.

He was grateful to still be alive and well to do this for her. He was the happiest father on earth at that moment.
She took her father's hand, ready to be married in the eyes of God and man to the love of her life.
The music began, and they slowly walked down the aisle, with little Viola
leading the way.

The aisle was lined wvith fragrant flowers, and a red carpet stretched from the entrance to the altar where the groom stood. A magnificent chandelier hung above, casting a warm golden glow on the space. The air was filled with the harmonious sounds of a live orchestra, playing a beautiful symphony that echoed throughout the grand hall.

Everyone's eyes were on the entrance as the bride walked in,escorted by her father.

Grandma Helen felt incredibly emotional. One thing she had prayed for was to see her son married in the church, and now her wish had been fulfilled.

Caleb was also happy. He was grateful to be alive to witness this day. If he passed away now, he would feel fulfilled.

Sarah held her baby in her arms as she watched the moment with her husband Anthony. Michael and Matthew were also glad to be celebrating this day with their dear friend.

Sandra smiled,glancing at her fiancé, who smiled back at her. Soon, she would be walking down the aisle as well.

Eric handed Lily over to Alexander but not before saying this:

"I know you two have been married by law for a few years, but let me tell you-please take care of her," he whispered.

Alexander nodded.
After exchanging vows and saying "I do,” Alexander removed the veil and was once again in awe of how beautiful his bride was.
"You look so beautiful; words can't really express how you look right now.
"he said.

Lily smiled. "And you look handsome."

"I love you so much,Lily."

"And I love you too."

They kissed, and the crowd erupted into applause, cheering for the happy couple.
###Chapter 149

5 Years Later

Lily was still in bed sleeping when he felt someone get into the bed and roll towards him. The person kissed him on the cheek with his tiny lips and played with his hair with his tiny hands.

Lily smiled because he already knew who it was. He opened his eyes and was greeted with his cute little face.

"Wakey Wakey mummy," he said with his tiny voice.

Lily smiled as she opened her eyes, knowing it was her son, Aden. She wrapped her hand around him and gave him kissesall over his face."My cute little prince."

Aden giggled as his mummy tickled him.

"Did you come to wake mummy?"

Aden nodded. "DDaddy asked me to come wake you, he said that the others will soon arrive," he said with his tiny voice that was like music to Lily's ears.

Lily laughed inwardly, not Alexander sending his son to come wake her after he had kept her awake all night.

Just a year after their official wedding. Aden came as a blessing to them.She did not think she was going to get pregnant again, but the heavens blessed her and Alexander with this cuteness in front of her. Aden was the male version of her; he had turned 3 years old two months ago.
"Okay, sweetheart,go play with your sister and the others while mummy
gets ready, okay?"

"Okay, mummy." He kissed her on the cheek before getting off the bed and running off.

She laughed as he ran with his little legs. "Be careful, baby, so you won't fall."


"Okay, mummy," he screamed in response with his tiny voice.

After having her bath, she put on a free-flowing dress and a cream hat with her hair down. They were going on a picnic with family and friends and would engage in games this summer holiday in the resort.

They had always come to the resort every summer holiday for the last five years. The first summer holiday, Grandma Helen was present.

But the second year, she wasn't. She was really sick and had passed away a weeks after she gave birth to Aden.

Lily was happy that Grandma Helen got to see Aden before she died.

Grandma Helen had said that she felt fulfilled in life and was ready to finally go meet her husband.

May her soul rest in peace.

Lily stepped out and smiled when she saw everyone waiting outside for the resort luxury bus to arrive, so they could head to the picnic location inside the resort near the mountainside.

Her eyes went to her grandfather, who was busy playing with his great-grandson. Both were laughing so loud. She was glad that her grandfather was still alive to play with his great-grandchildren, even though he was
getting older with each passing year.

Her eyes went to Sandra, Alexander's sister, who had gotten married four years ago and was now pregnant. She was with her husband and looked as happy as ever.

Then there was Sarah, who was chasing her five-year-old son around and screaming his name to stop running. Her husband was not present today since he had business to do.

Then there was Michael and Mathew, who were present with their wives.They had both decided to settle down just 2 years ago after they met the two sisters and got married almost at the same time.

Lily smiled when her eyes went to Angelina, Alexander's mother, who was having a conversation with 10-year-old Viola, who looked older than her age. Angelina looked so at peace and happy, enjoying listening to Viola,who was happily telling her about her little school science project that was a success.

Viola had told Lily and Alexander that she wanted to be a scientist, and Alexander was so proud that he was going to have a child who was a scientist.

Lily didn't expèct less from her daughter, who had an IQ that was so high.

Angelina was sad she wasn't able to attend their church wedding, but that was because she was still in the hospital. Ariana was finally discharged from the hospital only 2 years ago but kept receiving treatment until recently when the doctors said she was okay. She still had scars from the accident, but overall, she was fine now, and Alexander had reconciled with her. He decided to accept her back as his mother only if she kept proving to him that accepting her back was worth it.
Lily felt sad that her father. Peter Blake. was not here with his new wife.She had encouraged her father to get married again because the last thing she wanted was for him to grow old alone.

They weren't here because they had recently moved to Rome. Her father had set up a branch of their company there. so he needed to be there to run it until it was stable. His wife was 10 years younger than he was, and they were a perfect match.

She was happy she now had someone to call mother again. Nina had once been married and had grown-up kids who were adults now and in university. She was a great mother to her kids and had proven to be a great stepmother to Lily. She treated her like her own child. Nina always reminded her of her own mother. The resemblance she had with her late mother, both in looks and personality, was one reason why her father had agreed to marry her.

Another person who loved Nina so much was Caleb. He had approved of their marriage because Nina was a good fit for his son.

What more could she ever ask for? The heavens had blessed her with everything she ever wanted, and one of those blessings was a stable and complete family.

She felt a hand around her waist and smiled, knowing it was Alexander.

"Why are you just standing here instead of waiting for the bus with the others? I don't even understand why y'all choose to use the bus when we have luxury cars to take us there."

Lily turned to him and pinched his cheek. "Because we decided to be simple for once. You should too, baby."
Alexander sighed. "Okay,my love."

Lily laughed at his facial expression, which looked sad. "You want a kiss?"

Alexander nodded immediately,and it made her laugh.

They both kissed as if there was nobody else around.
###Chapter 150

The house was quiet, save for the soft hum of the evening air and the distant chirp of crickets. Lily and Alexander sat together on the couch,wrapped in the warmth of each other's company. It had been one of those rare,peaceful evenings where the world seemed to pause. The kids were asleep, the house felt like a sanctuary, and for the first time in a long while,they had time to themselves.

Lily leaned her head on Alexander's shoulder, sighing contentedly.“I wish we could have nights like this more often."

Alexander chuckled softly, brushing a stray lock of hair from her face."We will. It's just that life has a way of keeping us busy."

They both laughed, the moment feeling perfect. But just as Lily closed her eyes, content to soak in the stillness, the sound of a knock at the door shattered the calm.

"Who could that be?”Lily murmured, her voice tinged with curiosity.

Alexander stood up slowly, an uneasy tension flickering in his eyes.“I'll go check.”

Lily watched him, puzzled by his sudden change in demeanor. He was always calm, always confident. But tonight, something seemed different.As he opened the door, Lily's curiosity deepened, and when she saw the unfamiliar face standing in the doorway, her heart skipped a beat.
The man in the doorway was older than Alexander, with dark hair speckled with gray. His expression was neutral, though there was an unmistakable familiarity in his gaze as he locked eyes with Alexander.
"Alexander," the man said,his voice deep and steady.

Lily stood up. her instinets on alert. Something was wrong. The air felt thick with unspoken words. She glanced at Alexander, who had gone stiff.His jaw tightened, and his eyes shifted slightly,avoiding her gaze.

"John." Alexander greeted the man, his tone curt."What are you doing here?”


John stepped forward, his eyes flickering momentarily toward Lily before returning to Alexander.“We need to talk."

Lily felt a knot tightenin her stomach. The tension in the room was palpable, and as thetwo men exchanged a few more words, it was clear that whatever conversation was about to unfold, it was not meant for her ears.

Alexander turned to her then, his expression softer but still guarded.“Lily,I-”He stopped himself, visibly trying to collect his thoughts.

“I'll be in the kitchen,” Lily said, her voice steady even as her pulse quickened. She turned and walked away, her mind racing with questions.Who was this man? And why did Alexander seem so unsettled by his presence?

Lily sat down at the kitchen table, her hands gripping the edge as she tried to calm her thoughts. She couIdn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. Why hadn't Alexander mentioned this person before? And why did he seem so... on edge?

It wasn't long before Alexander entered, his face a mix of frustration and something she couldn't quite place. He closed the door behind him,locking it, and stood there for a moment, as if gathering the courage to
speak.

"I should have told you about this earlier," he began, his voice low and heavy. "But I didn't know how."


Lily raised an eyebrow, her heart poundling.“What is this about.Alexander?"


Alexander sighed,sitting across from her. "John was someone from my past. Someone I thought I had left behind. But he... he has a lot of history with me. And some things he said tonight. things I never wanted you to know...”

Lily's breath caught in her throat. "What kind of history?" Her voice shook slightly, a mixture of anger and fear creeping in.

Alexander looked away, his fingers rubbing the back of his neck nervously.“It's not what you think. It's just... things from my past that I didn't want to bring into our present.'

Lily's gaze narrowed. “You're telling me that someone you knew...someone important enough for you to avoid mentioning all these years.just shows up at our door? And you didn't think to tell me about this before?”

Alexander's eyes softened with regret. "Lily, I never meant to keep this from you. I was just protecting you... from the pain of things that don't matter anymore."

"Then why didn't you tell me?" Lily whispered, her voice trembling."Why keep this a secret?"
"I didn't want to lose you," Alexander admitted, his voice cracking. "I was afraic that if vou knew the truth about everything,.. about who I was
before... you'd leave me. I can't bear the thought of losing you."

The weight of his words hit Lily hard. She took a deep breath, trying to steady herself. The hurt wasn't just about the secret itself-it was about the fact that Alexander had felt he couldn't trust her with it.

Lily looked into his eyes, seeing the raw vulnerability there. She had always known him to be strong, unwavering. But this was a side of him she had never seen before-the side of him that was afraid, not of losing her. but of the unknown consequences of his past.

"Alexander, I..." She faltered. unsure of how to express the whirlwind of emotions that had risen in her chest. “I need you to be honest with me.Whatever it is, whatever you've kept hidden... we'll face it together. But you have to promise me-no more secrets. I can't love a man who keeps things from me. I need to trust you."

He nodded, his eyes filled with guilt. “I promise. No more secrets."

Lily took a deep breath and reached for his hand. “We'll work through this. But I need to know everything. I can't keep living with questions hanging over us.”

Alexander squeezed her hand, his grip firm. "I'll tell you everything.I won't keep anything from you again.”

The room was silent for a moment, as they both absorbed the gravity of the situation. Despite the uncertainty of the revelation, Lily felt a sense of relief in his honesty. This moment would pass, and they would grow stronger for it.
Alexander pulled her into his arms, holding her tightly. "I love you, Lily. I'm so sorry for keeping this from you."
"I love you too," she whispered, her voice soft. “And we'll get through this.Together.”


As they stood there, locked in each other's embrace. Lily realized that love wasn't just about the good times. It was about facing the challenges, the secrets. and the fears-together. No matter what the past held.they would always have each other.

But just as they started to find solace in their renewed connection, the doorbell rang again, pulling them both out of their moment of peace. This time, the sound was sharper, more insistent.

Lily's heart skipped a beat.

What now?
###Chapter 151

As Alexander stood there, his mind racing with the revelation that Maxwell had used the car explosion to eliminate his own informant,something unexpected happened. His phone buzzed again, this time with a message that chilled him to his core.

**Unknown Number: "You're not seeing the full picture, Alexander. Think deeper. You're not the only one being played."**

Alexander stared at the message, his breath catching in his throat. "What does this mean?" he muttered under his breath. Lily glanced over, noticing the tension on his face.

"What's wrong?"she asked.

Alexander quickly showed her the message, and Lily frowned.“Who could have sent that?"


Before Alexander could answer, another message popped up.


**Unknown Number; "There's another player in this game. One that's been moving the pieces from the shadows all along."**


Alexander's blood ran cold. Someone else? Someone even more dangerous than Maxwell or Ariana? The thought was almost impossible to believe.but something deep inside him knew it was true. He looked around the burning airstrip, the pieces of this twisted game falling into place in a way that left him feeling unsettled.

Just then, a loud crack sounded from behind them. Caleb emerged from the darkness, looking worse for wear after the firefight with Maxwell's men.but alive. "Maxwell got away," he announced, frustration lining his voice."
We lost track of him after the explosion."

Alexander clenched his fists. "Ariana's gone too. She's planning something big, but now..." He trailed off, unsure how to explain the mysterious messages without sounding paranoid.

"What is it?" Caleb pressed, sensing his hesitation.

Alexander sighed and handed Caleb his phone, showing him the messages.Caleb's expression shifted from confusion to deep concern.

"This changes everything," Caleb murmured. “If someone else has been orchestrating all of this, then we're fighting a ghost we don't even know."

But the tension in the air only grew heavier when the next message came through:

**Unknown Number: "Maxwell's not who you think. He's been manipulated, just like the rest of you1. The real mastermind is closer than you think."**


Lily, reading over Caleb's shoulder, gasped."“Maxwell? Manipulated? By who?”


The realization hit Alexander like a ton of bricks. "What if... What if Ariana and Maxwell were both pawns? What if someone else has been controlling the strings, making them think they were in control?"

Suddenly, a thought occurred to him-one that sent a shiver down his spine."Peter."


Caleb whipped around,his eyes wide."What?"

"Peter-Lily's father. He's been absent for months, supposedly working on
the new branch in a remote area. But what if he wasn't? What if he's been the one pulling the strings all along?"

Lily's face went pale as the pieces began to fall into place. "No... that can't be right. My father wouldn't-he wouldn't get involved in something like this." But even as she said it, doubt crept into her voice.

Caleb took a deep breath. "It makes sense. Peter has the resources, the connections. He's always stayed in the background, letting others do the dirty work. What if he's been playing all of you-Aríana,Maxwell,even us-to achieve some larger goal?"

The final message from the unknown sender appeared on Alexander's phone:

**Unknown Number: "You've been looking in the wrong direction,Alexander. Peter is the one who started this war. He's always been the puppet master."**


Alexander's hand tightened around the phone. "We need to find Peter.Now."


But just as they were about to leave, the airstrip lights flickered, and a helicopter's loud thrum broke through the night. A sleek, black helicopter appeared on the horizon, flying low and fast, headed straight for them.

"It's him," Caleb said, his voicefilled with grim certainty."Peter."

The helicopter touched down on the far end of the airstrip, and as the door swung open, Peter Kane stepped out, flanked by heavily armed men.He walked forward with an air of calm authority, his eyes locking onto Alexander and Lily with a chilling confidence.

“I see you've finally figured it out," Peter said,his voice cool and
controlled.“But you're too late."

Lily's voice trembled as she stepped forward, her eyes searching her father's face."Dad... What have you done?"

Peter's expression didn't change. “Everything I did, I did for the family.For power. Control. Survival."

Alexander took a sep toward him, fury bubbling beneath the surface."You manipulated Ariana. Maxwell-everyone. You started all of this, and for what? To build an empire?"

Peter looked at him, unbothered. “Empires aren't built by being soft,Alexander. They're built by controlling the game. And right now, I hold all the pieces."

But before anyone could react, a sudden gunshot rang out. Peter's eyes widened in shock as he clutched his chest, blood staining his shirt. He staggered back, collapsing to theground.

From the shadows, Ariana emerged, her gun still smoking. “You didn't think I'd let you have the last move,did you,Peter?”

Chaos erupted. Caleb and Alexander dove for cover as Peter's men opened fire on Ariana. But she moved like a shadow, darting between cover,her shots precise and deadly. In the span of moments, she had taken down three of Peter's guards, her cold determination etched on her face.

Peter lay gasping on the ground, struggling to speak. "Ariana... you were..supposed to follow...”

She knelt beside him, her face expressionless. "I followed your plan, Peter.Until it no longer suited me,"
With one final breath, Peter Kane, the mastermind behind it all, died at Ariana's feet.

Lily stood frozen, unable to process the whirlwind of events. Her father-dead. Ariana, her sworn enemy-victorious in her own twisted way. And now, the game had changed yet again.

Ariana straightened up, turning to face Alexander and Caleb. "This isn't over. Maxwell is still out there, and as long as he lives, this war continues."

With that, she disappeared into the darkness, leaving them all to wonder:Was she the final player? Or was there another twist yet to come?
###Chapter 152

As Ariana vanished into the night, the tension that had been thick in the air finally began to dissipate, but the weight of what had just transpired still pressed down on everyone. Caleb moved over to Peter's lifeless body.his face grim as he crouched next to the fallen mastermind.

"We need to clean this up." Caleb said softly, though his words carried an edge of frustration. "Peter may be dead, but Ariana's still playing the game.And if what she said about Maxwell is true, this isn't over."

Alexander's mind raced, trying to piece together the fragmented chaos that had uinfolded before him. “Maxwell,” he muttered, shaking his head.“We've been chasing the wrong person all along. We thought Maxwell was pulling the strings, but Peter was the true architect. And now, with Peter gone... Maxwell is free to make his own moves.”

Lily,still shaken by her father's sudden betrayal and death, stood silently,her face pale as she tried to hold back the flood of emotions threatening to overwhelm her. "He was doing this for us," she whispered, her voice barely audible. "For me... for the family."

Alexander walked over to her, gently placing his hand on her shoulder. "It wasn't for you, Lily. It was for him. Peter's obsession with power blinded him. You're not responsible for his choices."


Lily looked up at him, tears welling in her eyes. “But I didn't see it coming. I didn't know..."


Before Alexander could respond, his phone buzzed again, jolting him back to the present. He glanced at the screen-an urgent news alert.

**Breaking News: No Bodies Found in Vehicle Explosion. Authorities
Confirm Car was Empty.**

Alexander's heart skipped a beat. "They've confirmed it-no one was in the car. Lily, you were never in danger."

Lily blinked, confused. “But... what does that mean?"

“It means Maxwell and Ariana were both fooled," Caleb interjected,standing up from Peter's body. “Someone set up the explosion, but it wasn't to kill anyone. It was meant to mislead us."

Alexander took a deep breath, the weight of this revelation settling in. “We've been chasing shadows," he said quietly. “The real enemy is still out there. and they've been one step ahead of us the whole time."

But before they could process this new twist, another sound cut through the air-the faint hum of approaching helicopters. Alexander's eyes darted to the horizon, where several black helicopters were quickly closing in.

"Maxwell." Caleb said darkly. "He's not going to stop until he finishes what Peter started."

"Or takes control of what Peter left behind," Alexander added, his mind quickly forming a plan. "We can't wait for him to come to us. We need to move now,strike before he does."

Lily wiped her tears, her resolve hardening. "What's the plan?"

But before Alexander could answer, his phone buzzed again-another message, this one even more cryptic than the last.

**Unknown Number: "Maxwell's not your biggest threat. Look deeper.You've only scratched the surface."**
Alexander feIt a cold chill run down his spine. If Maxwell wasn't the biggest threat,then who was?

Suddenly, a distant memory flashed in his mind-something Peter had once saidin passing, about an old ally who had helped him rise to power.A shadowy figure who had remained hidden, even as Peter built his empire.

"Whoever sent this," Alexander said, holding up his phone, "they know more than we do. There's another player we haven't accounted for."

Caleb frowned. "Someone more powerful than Maxwell? That's hard to believe."

But Alexander shook his head. "Not more powerful-more strategic.Someone who has been pulling strings from the shadows, just like Peter.And now, with Peter gonë, they're ready to make their move."

Suddenly,the helicopters above began circling the area, their searchlights illuminating the dark landscape. “We're out of time,” Alexander said,his voice steady but urgent. “We need to find Maxwell before this escalates any further.”


As the group moved quickly to get into their cars and leave, Alexander's mind continued to race. Who was this new player?And what was their endgame?


Maxwell may have been the most immediate threat, but now, with Peter dead and Ariana still at large, the true mastermind was finally emerging from the shadows. And Alexander knew that if they didn't uncover the truth soon, this game-one that had already claimed too many lives-was about to become even deadlier.
###Chapter 153

While Alexander. Lily, and Caleb sped away into the night,trying to untangle the web of secrets surrounding Maxwell, Ariana,and the new shadowy figure, events were unfolding elsewhere-far from their current battlefield.

In a dimly lit office overlooking the city. Maxwell sat in his leather chair,a glass of whiskey in hand. He had received word of Peter's death and the explosion. To anyone else, it would have seemed like a victory. But to Maxwell, something didn't feel right.

He leaned forward, staring at the dossier spread across his desk-a file containing everything he knew about Alexander, Lily,and their connections to Peter. But it wasn't the information about them that bothered him. It was something Peter had told him years ago, a warning he had foolishly dismissed at the time.

"Never assume you're the only one at the top of the ladder," Peter had said.his voice thick with menace. "There are always other hands pulling the strings. always other players waiting for their turn."

Maxwell had ignored that advice, thinking his own ambition would be enough to secure his dominance. Now, with Peter gone and Ariana on the run, the truth of Peter's words weighed on him. He wasn't the king of this game-someone else was.

His phone buzzed on the desk. He glanced at the screen. It was a secure message from one of his inside sources.

**“They're onto you. Meet at the old warehouse. We need to move now."**

Maxwell's eyes narrowed. Whoever had sent the message wasn't talking
about Alexander and his crew. This was about the hidden force Peter had hinted at, the same one Alexander had just begun to suspect.

Without hesitation, Maxwell stood, grabbed his jacket, and walked out of the office, his mind working through the next steps. If this shadow figure wanted to make their move, Maxwell would be ready. He wasn't about to lose control of his empire-not to anyone.




Meanwhile, in a different part of the city, Ariana had taken refuge in an old safe house she had once used during her early days working with Peter. She paced back and forth, her mind racing. The attempt to kill Lily had failed, and now she was a target. But Ariana wasn't one to cower in fear.She had survived worse.

She replayed the last moments before she fled the scene, the image of Peter's lifeless body etched in her mind. His death had been inevitable-he had become too reckless, too arrogant. But Maxwell... Maxwell was a different kind of problem. He was ruthless, calculating, and unlike Peter, he wouldn't fall so easily.


As she sat down at a small table in the corner of the room, she pulled out a burner phone and dialed a number. After a few rings, a familiar voice answered.


"Are you ready?" the voice asked,low and cold.

“I didn't come this far to lose now," Ariana replied, her tone sharp. "Maxwell is the last piece on the board. Once he's out of the way. I'll have full control of Peter's assets."

There was a pause on the other end. "Maxwell isn't your only problem.
Alexander and his crew are still in play."

"I know." Ariana said, her voice full of venom."But I have a plan for them. It's time to finish what Peter started. I'm done playing defense.This ends tonight."

The voice on the phone hesitated for a moment. “Be careful. This game has more players than you think."

Ariana smiled darkly. “I'm counting on that.”

She hung up the phone, her mind already working through her next steps.If Maxwell and Alexander were both going to be a threat, then she would need to act quickly. The longer she waited, the more dangerous things would become. But Ariana wasn't worried. She had always thrived in chaos.




At the same time, in a remote, luxurious villa far from the chaos unfolding in the city, the true mastermind sat quietly, watching events unfold through a series of screens. The person's face remained hidden in the shadows, their hands folded neatly on the desk in front of them.

They had watched Peter rise and fall, orchestrated the conflict between Maxwell and Alexander, and now, with Ariana making her move,everything was coming together as planned.

A soft knock echoed in the room, and a figure entered silently, handing over a small tablet. On the screen was the latest update-news reports confirming that no one had been found in the burning car. Lily was still alive.


The mastermind smiled. “Everything is proceeding as expected."
The figure nodded and disappeared as quickly as they had come, leaving the mastermind alone with their thoughts. They reached for the tablet and swiped through a series of documents-information on Maxwell, Alexander,
Lily,Ariana, and even Peter. All of them had been pawns in a much larger game.

But now, the time had come to reveal the true scope of the plan.With Peter gone and Maxwell and Ariana poised to destroy each other,the final phase could begin.

The mastermind leaned back in their chair, satisfied. Soon, everything would fall into place, and the world would be theirs to control. As the screen showed live footage of Maxwell heading to the warehouse and Ariana preparing for her final showdown, the mastermind whispered to themselves:

“Let the final game begin."




Back with Alexander, Lily, and Caleb, they continued their drive, unaware that the battle they thought they were winning was only part of a much larger, more dangerous game. As the night deepened, they sped toward an uncertain future, where every move would determine who would survive and who would fall in the ultimate fight for control.
###Chapter 154

As the tension between the various players reached its peak, Ariana prepared for her final confrontation. She had holed up in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the city, her nerves steeled for what she knew was coming. The battle with Alexander and Lily had escalated to the point of no return, and she had no intention of backing down.

In the dim, flickering light of the warehouse, Ariana sat at a makeshift desk, going over the last few details of her plan. She had been outmaneuvered before, but not this time. She had escaped their pursuit.and now it was time to strike back. This would be the final  Chapter, the one that decided who walked away victorious.

As she plotted her next move, she received a call from one of her men."They're on the way. You need to get ready."

Ariana smirked. "Good. Let them come. I'm ready for them."




Meanwhile,Alexander, Lily, and Caleb had tracked her location to the warehouse. After the shocking revelation that no one had died in the car explosion,Alexander knew that they had one last chance to end this once and for all. Ariana had pushed them to the brink, and now it was time for retribution.


"This ends tonight," Alexander said, tightening his grip on his weapon as they approached the warehouse.

"She's dangerous," Lily added. "We can't underestimate her, not after everything she's pulled."
"We won't," Caleb reassured them. "But we need to be smart. She'll be expecting us."

The three of them moved in silence, their footsteps barely making a sound as they closed in on the warehouse. The night air was thick with tension,and the sounds of the city seemed to fade as they prepared for the final showdown.




Inside the warehouse. Ariana heard them coming. She had prepared for this moment, placing traps throughout the building and positioning her remaining allies in strategic locations. She knew she was outnumbered, but she thrived in situations like this.

As Alexander, Lily, and Caleb entered the warehouse, Ariana's traps sprung to life. Explosions rocked the building, forcing them to duck for cover. But they pressed on, determined to reach her.

"You can't win this, Ariana!" Alexander shouted, his voice echoing through the cavernous space. "It's over!"


"You think so?" Ariana's voice called out from the shadows. "I've always been one step ahead of you, Alexander. You can't stop me."

But as she spoke, a flash of movement caught her eye. Lily, moving faster than she anticipated, had managed to disable one of her traps. Caleb, using his military training, had neutralized two of her men with expert precision.And Alexander... Alexander was closing in, his determination evident in every step.

Ariana fired her weapon, but Alexander dodged the shots with ease.Before she could react, he was upon her, knocking the gun from her hand.
The two of them grappled in a fierce struggle, their years of animosity culminating in this one,brutal confrontation.

For a moment, it seemed like Ariana might get the upper hand. But then,Lily joined the fray, delivering a swift, devastating blow that sent Ariana crashing to the floor.

Breathing heavily, Alexander stood over her. "It's over, Ariana," he said.his voice cold.

Ariana, bloodied and defeated, looked up at him with a sneer. "You think this is over? You have no idea what's coming. I'm just the beginning."

But as she tried to pull herself up, she realized it was too late. Her plans had crumbled around her, and her allies had abandoned her. She had nothing left.

"I told you," Alexander said quietly. "This ends tonight."




By the time the authorities arrived, the scene at the warehouse was already over. Ariana was taken into custody, her reign of terror finally brought to an end. The media would later report her arrest, painting her as a mastermind who had manipulated events from behind the scenes, causing chaos and destruction in her wake. But now, her story was over.

Alexander, Lily, and Caleb stood outside the warehouse, watching as the police led Ariana away in handcuffs. There was no sense of triumph, only relief that this  Chapter of their lives was finally closed.

"It's done," Lily said softly.

"Yeah," Alexander replied, though his voice carried the weight of
everything they'd been through. "It's done."




Ariana's capture marked the end of the war between them. Her twisted plans had unraveled. and she would no longer be a threat. As Alexander.Lily, and Caleb walked away from the warehouse, they knew that the battle was over. But deep down, they also knew that the shadowy figure behind Maxwell and Peter still lingered in the distance, watching,waiting.

For now, though, they had earned their peace.
###Chapter 155

As the dust settled from Ariana's downfall, Alexander, Lily, and Caleb returned to their respective lives, trying to find some semblance of normalcy after the chaos. But peace was fleeting in their world.

A few days later, Alexander sat in his office, staring at the screen of his computer. The media had been abuzz with the arrest of Ariana, but now there was a new storm brewing-a mysterious series of high-profile disappearances across the city. Important figures from the political,business, and criminal worlds were vanishing without a trace, and the police had no leads.

Alexander frowned as he read the latest article. One of the missing individuals was Ethan's uncle, a powerful polítician with connections to both legitimate businesses and underground networks. It wasn't a coincidence. and Alexander knew it. Something bigger was happening,something they hadn't anticipated.

Just as he was about to pick up the phone to call Lily, his phone buzzed with a message.

**Unknown Number:** *"We're not done. The game has ony just begun.
If you want to save your friends, meet me where it all started."*


Alexander's blood ran cold. He knew that tone-it wasn't Ariana,but someone even more dangerous. His mind raced back to the words Ariana had said before her capture: *"You have no idea what's coming. I'm just the beginning."*


He quickly called Lily, who picked up on the second ring. "I just got a message," Alexander said without preamble.
"So did 1." Lily replied, her voice tight with concern. "It's starting again,isn't it?"

“Yes." Alexander said grimly. "And whoever's behind this,they want us to play their game."




Meanwhile, at Caleb's estate, the situation was no different. Caleb had just finished a meeting when his assistant brought him an envelope. The envelope bore no markings, but inside was a simple note that read:*"You stopped Ariana, but now it's tme for the real battle. Choose your allies wisely."*

Caleb's brow furrowed as he read the note. He had always known that Ariana wasn't acting alone, but this was confirmation that a larger force was pulling the strings. He immediately called Alexander and Lily to discuss their next steps.




That evening, the three met at a secluded location-a quiet,abandoned building on the edge of town. The place was significant; it was the very spot where their conflict with Ariana had first begun.

"I got the message too," Caleb said as soon as they gathered, holding up the cryptic note.


"This isn't just about Ariana anymore," Lily added."There's something much bigger at play. Someone else is pulling the strings."

Alexander nodded. "We need to figure out who's behind this before more people disappear. But I have a feeling we're not just dealing with crimínals-we're dealing with someone who's deeply embedded in both
the legal and illegal worlds."

As they strategized, a figure watched them from the shadows, unseen and unnoticed. It was Maxwell. He had been working in the background,moving pieces on the board that none of them had realized existed. He had been Ariana's silent partner, and now, with her out of the way,he was free to operate without her unpredictable interference.

Maxwell was meticulous, calm, and always two steps ahead. He had no interest in chaotic revenge like Ariana; his ambitions were much greater.He wanted control-of everything.

But Maxwell wasn't working alone either. He had partners,powerful figures like Peter, who had been working behind the scenes to set up a web of influence that spanned continents. And now, with the disappearances happening, they were ready to make their next move.




As Alexander, Lily, and Caleb dug deeper,they realized the disappearances weren't random. Each person who had vanished had connections to a shadowy global network that dealt in information, arms, and power. And at the center of it all was an organization they had heard rumors about,but never believed truly existed-*The Syndicate.*

"We've been looking at this all wrong," Caleb said, spreading out documents on the table. “Ariana was just a pawn. The Syndicate has been manipulating events from behind the scenes for years. And now that she's gone, they're finally making their move."

“But why now?” Lily asked. "What's changed?”

Alexander stared at the documents, piecing it together. "Ariana was useful
to them, but she was too volatile. Now that she's gone, they want to ensure no one stands in their way. The disappearances-these are people who could challenge their power. And now, they're trying to bring us into the fold, or eliminate us."

"They've underestimated us," Caleb said, his voice steady. "They thínk they can control the game, but they don't know what we're capable of.”

As they planned their next move, the clock was ticking. The Syndicate was powerful, more than they had ever realized. and now Alexander, Lily, and Caleb were in their sights. The real battle wasn't with Ariana-it was with an unseen enemy that had already infiltrated every level of society.




Elsewhere,Maxwell sat in a dimly lit office, speaking into a secure phone.“They're taking the bait," he said with a smile. “Everything is going according to plan. Once they're fully engaged, we can move forward with the next phase."

"And what about Alexander and his team?”a voice on the other end asked.

Maxwell leaned back in his chair, his expression unreadable.“Don't worry about them. They're exactly where we need them to be."

As the line went dead, Maxwell looked out the window, his mind already racing ahead to the final stages of his plan. He had played his part perfectly, and now it was only a matter of time before he had everything he wanted.




Back at the hideout, Alexander, Lily, and Caleb prepared for the storm ahead, unaware of just how deep the conspiracy ran. The real war had
0名称	0801	-No
###Chapter 156

As Alexander, Lily, and Calebo continued strategizing, a new storm brewed behind the scenes. Ariana's mother, Carolina, had just learned of her daughter's downfall and capture. Carolina was not an ordinary woman.She had ties to power, wealth, and an extensive network of loyal followers that made her dangerous. She wasn't just upset-she was livid.

Carolina paced her luxurious mansion, her fury simmering under the surface. Her eyes glinted with a cold, calculated anger. Ariana may have been reckless, but she was still Carolina's daughter, and no one harmed her family without consequences.

"How could this happen?" Carolina muttered under her breath. Her long-time confidant, Valeria, stood quietly in the corner, awaiting her next command."They underestimated her," Carolina continued. "But it's not over yet. Not by a long shot."

Valeria stepped forward. "What do you wish to do, mna'am? The Syndicate is moving forward with their plans. They might view Ariana's capture as acceptable collateral."


Carolina turned sharply, her eyes filled with resolve. "The Syndicate mnay have used my daughter, but they made a mistake by leaving her to fall.Now, I'm going to make them pay for it. And I'm going to destroy everyone who had a hand in this."


She clenched her fists, the wheeIs in her mind already turning. She knew that her enemies-Alexander, Lily, Caleb, and now The Syndicate-would be expecting a retaliation. But Carolina wasn't planning a simple attack.She was crafting a masterpiece of revenge.
Meanwhile, back at Caleb's estate, the group was still focused on the mysterious disappearances when they received some disturbing news.

"The media is finally reporting that no one was found in the wreckage of Lily's car," Calebsaid, looking up from his laptop. "The official statemnent is that the car was remotely driven, and there were no casualties."

Alexander sat up straighter. "So, the truth is out. Maxwell and The Syndicate will know by now that Lily wasn't in that car. They'll be coming after her harder now."

"We need to stay ahead of them," Lily said, pacing the room."If Maxwell is working with The Syndicate, we're dealing with something far more dangerous than Ariana's vendetta."

Just as they were formulating their next move, Caleb's phone rang. He glanced at the screen, and his face darkened. “It's a private line... from someone I never thought I'd hear from again.”

Alexander and Lily exchanged worried glances as Caleb answered.

“Caleb," came the sharp voice on the other end. "This is Carolina."

Caleb's eyes widened. He hadn't spoken to Carolina in years, not sincethe falling out between her and her daughter Ariana. She had always been a behind-the-scenes figure, ruthless but calculated. Now, her voice was ful of anger.


“What do you want?" Caleb asked cautiously.

“My daughter," Carolina hissed. "You helped bring her down.You thought you were clever, taking her out of thegame. But you have no idea who you're dealing with. You're about to find out."
Caleb swallowed hard. "Carolina, Ariana was out of control. She-"

"I don't care!" Carolina cut him off. "She's my blood, and I will not let this go unanswered. You and your little friends think you can fight The Syndicate, but you're only scratching the surface of what's coming.I'm going to make sure that all of you pay for what you've done to my daughter.”

Before Caleb could respond, the line went dead. He slowly lowered the phone and turned to Alexander and Lily.

"That was Carolina," he said quietly. "And she's coming for us."




Carolina,after hanging up, was already making plans. She knew where to strike, and she knew the weak points of Alexander's group. But what she had in mind was bigger than simple vengeance. She was about to unleash something even The Syndicate hadn't prepared for.

She called one of her most trusted allies, a powerful figure who had stayed hidden from the public eye for years-Vincent, a master of manipulation and control, and someone who had once been part of The Syndicate before leaving to carve his own empire. Carolina knew that with his help, she could cripple both The Syndicate and Alexander's group, creating chaos from within.


“Vincent,” Carolina said when he picked up the phone.“It's time to settle an old score."




At the same time, Alexander and his team were growing more anxious.The phone call from Carolina had rattled them, but they knew they had to
stay focused.

"We need to find out what Carolina's next move is," Alexander said,trying to stay calm. "She's more dangerous than Ariana ever was, and now that she's involved, we're facing an entirely different threat.”

"She's powerful," Lily added. "And she won't stop until she makes us pay.But what worries me is how much influence she has. If she gets the right people on her side, we'll be up against forces we haven't even anticipated."

As they prepared to face this new threat, another wave of bad news came in. Maxwell, using his network, had gained access to sensitive government data. and he was beginning to manipulate events in ways that put Alexander and his allies on the defensive.

Reports of new political alliances, business mergers, and even blackmail operations were flooding in. It was clear Maxwell wasn't just playing for personal gain-he was setting up something much larger. And now, with Carolina's interference, everything was becoming even more dangerous.

"We need to split our focus," Alexander said. “Caleb, you and I will handle Carolina. Lily,you'll need to figure out what Maxwell's planning with The Syndicate.”


The lines had been drawn. But just as Alexander thought they were ready to move, another shocking twist hit them. A series of secret documents were leaked to the press-documents that implicated Caleb in illegal dealings from years ago.

The timing was too perfect to be a coincidence.

“They're trying to tear us apart from the inside," Caleb said bitterly.“Someone's using my past against us."
As the team dealt with this sudden internal attack. Carolina was smiling in her office. She had only just begun her campaign of revenge, and it was already yielding resuIts. She had always been patient, and now, after years of waiting, it was finally her time to strike. She knew Maxwell was a threat.but he was also a pawn in her larger game. One way or another, everyone who had wronged her daughter would fall.

And she wasn't going to stop until she had destroyed every last one of them.
###Chapter 157

As Alexander and the group scrambled to contain the chaos around them.Carolina's master plan was unfolding at a rapid pace. News outlets were now picking up on Caleb's alleged involvement in shady business deals,and public opinion was turning against him. Even within their own circle,suspicion was beginning to grow.

Lily was busy working with her contacts to track down Maxwell's movements, but the leak about Caleb had sent ripples through their trust.Despite Caleb's explanations, the timing was too perfect to ignore.

"I swear I had nothing to do with those deals," Caleb repeated, frustration written all over his face. "It's old business. I was framed back then, and now it's coming back to bite me."

Alexander knew they couldn't afford any more division. "We need to focus.Carolina's playing us, and Maxwell is out there making his own moves.We can't let their distractions tear usapart."

Just as Alexander finished speaking, a new report came through on Lily's screen. Her face paled as she read the headline.

"Maxwell... he's staging a hostile takeover of one of the largest tech companies in the country," Lily said. "He's been buying up shares through shell corporations. If he gains control, he'll have access to resources we can't even fathom."


Alexander clenched his fists. "That means we're running out of time.Maxwell's using this to further his own agenda, and Carolina's playing a separate game. They may not be fully aligned, but their actions are pushing us into a corner."
Lily's phone buzzed with an encrypted message. She glanced at it and her eyes widened. "This is it," she whispered. "I've got a lead on Maxwell's next move. He's meeting with a key figure in the government to finalize his plans."

"Where's the meeting?" Alexander asked urgently.

"At a private estate outside the city," Lily replied. "But there's more-Carolina's name came up. She's also been in contact with this government official."

"That means Carolina might be using Maxwell's moves to her advantage,"Caleb concluded.

"Or they're secretly working together in ways we don't know yet," Lily added.





Meanwhile, Carolina was making her own preparations. In her mansion,surrounded by her most trusted allies, she stood in front of a grand map of the city. Little red pins marked key areas-financial districts, media hubs, political buildings.

"This city is the heart of their influence," she said coldly. "But I'm going to take it all from them, Maxwell is making his power play, but it's not about the money. It's about control."


Valeria, standing by Carolina's side, nodded. "Once he finalizes that takeover, we'll have leverage over every communication system and financial institution in the region. And when he's done, we'll use him to clean up the mess."

"Exactly," Carolína smirked. "He's a tool-nothing more. When he's
served his purpose, I'll discard him like I did the others. This is about Ariana's legacy. She may have been reckless, but I'll make sure her enemies burn."

Just then, another ally entered the room with news. "Ma'am, it appears that Alexander and his team are starting to piece together your connection to Maxwell. They've uncovered the location of his meeting."

Carolina smiled wickedly. "Good. Let them come. It's time we meet face to face. But this time, they won't walk away unscathed."




At the same time, Maxwell was in his private estate, preparing for his meeting with the government official. He believed everything was falling into place. His power was growing, his wealth expanding, and soon, he'd have control of the tech industry at his fingertips. But what he didn't know was that he, too, was being played.

As Maxwell awaited the arrival of his political contact, a sudden alert popped up on his phone. It was a news notification, and the headline read:"Government Official Linked to Secret Syndicate Deal with Maxwell."

He froze. This wasn't part of the plan. Someone had leaked the meeting details.


Furious,Maxwell slammed his fist on the table. He quickly called his security team, barking orders to secuare the estate. He suspected that Alexander's group had something to do with this leak, and he wasn't goingto let them disrupt his plans. Not now.

Little did Maxwell know, Carolina had orchestrated the leak. She had set Maxwell up, drawing attention to his dealings to weaken his position while
she quietly solidified her own power base. He was still useful to her-for now-but Carolina was always two steps ahead.




Back wvith Alexander, the team was preparing to intercept the meeting."We need to stop Maxwell before he completes this takeover," Alexander said. "But we also need to be ready for Carolina's next move. She's not going to sit quietly while we dismantle her plans."

Lily nodded in agreement. "We'll need to split up. I'll track down the government official. see what kind of leverage he has over Maxwell. You and Caleb should handle Maxwell directly."

As they set their plan into motion. Alexander received a notification on his phone. It was a news alert-finally, the media had confirmed that no one was in the burning car. Lily's survival had been publicly confirmed. But instead of relief. Alexander felt the weight of what was coming next.

Maxwell and Carolina now knew Lily was alive. And their enemies wouldn't stop until they had wiped out everyone in their way.




Back at Carolina's mansion, she received word of the media reports as well.
"Good," she murmured to herself, "Now the real game begins."


Valeria approached her witha file. "Ma'am, everything's ready. We've initiated the final phase."

Carolina opened the file and smiled at what she saw. This next step would not only cripple Maxwell's ambitions but would also break Alexander and his team in ways they could never imagine.
"We're going to end them all," Carolina said softly, a wicked gleam in her eyes. "Starting with Alexander."

The pieces were all falling into place.
###Chapter 158

As Carolina prepared her next move, Alexander and Lily made their way toward the estate where Maxwell was meeting the government official.They had little time and had to intercept the deal before it could go through. The stakes were higher than ever, and the pressure was mounting.

Maxwell's arrogance, however, had made him careless. Despite Carolina's manipulation. he believed he was still in control. He thought the news leak was nothing more than a minor hiccup. But as the government official arrived,Maxwell's unease grew.

"Do you have any idea what kind of heat we're under right now?" the official snapped, barely keeping his composure.

"I have it handled," Maxwell said coolly, even though he wasn't so sure anymore. "This deal will go through as planned."

The official shook his head. "There are too many eyes on us now. If we're exposed, the entire syndicate will go down. You'd better fix this."

Just as the meeting began, Alexander and Caleb infiltrated the estate. Using Lily's intel, they moved swiftly, positioning themselves just outside the conference room where Maxwell was negotiating.

"Once we have confirmation, we take them down," Alexander whispered,his eyes locked on the door. They had surveillance equipment ready to capture everything.

But before they could make their move, chaos erupted.
Back at Carolina's mansion. Valeria had initiated her secret plan. It wasn't just about Maxwell anymore. She was launching a full-scale attack on Alexander's team. Unbeknownst to Alexander, his location had been compromised. Valeria had tracked him and Caleb to the estate and sent a team of mercenaries to eliminate them.

"They think they can stop Maxwell and disrupt my plans?" Carolina sneered. "Let's show them how wrong they are."

Her mercenaries arrived at the estate silently, moving in like shadows. It wasn't long before Caleb sensed something was wrong.

"Alexander, we've got company," Caleb muttered, his hand hovering over his weapon.

Alexander's heart raced. They had walked into a trap, one orchestrated not just by Maxwell, but by Carolina herself.

"We need to move, now!" Alexander whispered sharply. "Abort the mission."


They tried to retreat, but the mercenaries were already closing in.




Meanwhile, back at Carolina's mansion, a new problem arose. Carolina's daughter, Ariana, had somehow escaped from the safehouse she had been locked in after her defeat. Furious and feeling betrayed, Ariana was determined to confront her mother.


Ariana barged into the mansion, her eyes filled with rage. "You think you can just leave me out of this, Mother?" she shouted, storming into the grand hall where Carolina was calmly sipping wine.
"You're too emotional," Carolina said without looking at her. "I'm doing what's necessary for our future."

"Our future? Or just yours?" Ariana fired back. "You used me as a pawn against Lily and Alexander. And now you think you can just move on without me?"

Carolina finally met her daughter's gaze. "You failed, Ariana. You let your personal vendetta cloud your judgment. Now, I'm cleaning up your mess."

Ariana's fists clenched. "You don't get to decide everything. This is my fight too. I'm not some pawn you can sacrifice."

Carolina's expression hardened. "If you can't handle the battlefield, then you are a pawn. Learn to play the game, or stay out of it."

Ariana stood silent for a moment, trembling with fury. Then, without another word, she turned and left. But instead of retreating, she had her own plans.




At the estate, Alexander and Caleb managed to evade the initial wave of mercenaries. But things were spiraling out of control. They needed an exit,and fast.


Lily,watching from her vantage point, quickly sent a message. "There's an underground tunnel in the west wing," she said through their earpieces."It'll lead you out to the forest. You don't have much time."

Alexander and Caleb sprinted toward the west wing, dodging gunfire and narrowly avoiding the mercenaries. As they reached the tunnel entrance,Caleb stopped abruptly.
"Go ahead," Caleb said, his voice low. "I'll cover you."

"What? No. We're in this together," Alexander protested.

"You're more valuable out there than I am. We need to make sure Maxwell doesn't succeed. I'll buy you time."

Reluctantly, Alexander nodded and dashed into the tunnel. Caleb turned and readied his weapon, determined to hold off the attackers for as long as he could.




At that same moment. Maxwell's paranoia had reached its peak. He sensed that his empire was crumbling around him, but before he could react, the government official suddenly pulled a gun on him.

"You've outlived your üsefulness, Maxwell," the official sneered. "Your fall will cover up all our tracks."

Maxwell's eyes widened in shock. "You're making a mistake," he hissed,slowly raising his hands.

The official was about to pull the trigger when suddenly the door was kicked open. Ariana stormed into the room, disarming the official in a split second and holding her gun to Maxwell's head.

"Surprised to see me?" Ariana said coldly.

Maxwell was frozen, unsure of what was happening. "Ariana... what are you doing?"

"I'm not done with this game," Ariana whispered. "You and my mother thought you could toss me aside. But I'm taking control now. And
Maxwell, you're going to help me."

With a wicked smile, she lowered her gun but kept her finger on the trigger.

Maxwell,realizing that Ariana was his only way out of this mess.nodded slowly. "Fine," he said, swallowing his pridle. "What's the plan?"




Back in the tunnel, Alexander emerged into the dense forest, breathless but determined. He had escaped the trap, but there was no time to rest. As he glanced back, the estate in the distance, smoke rising from the battle inside,he knew the fight was far from over.

The war had only just begun.
###Chapter 159

As Alexander emerged from the tunnel, his mind raced. He needed to regroup and figure out his next move. He couldn't shake the feeling that something bigger was at play-something Carolina had planned from the start. The mercenaries. Maxwell's betrayal, and now Ariana taking control-everything was happening too quickly, and the alliances were shifting faster than he could keep up.

Just as he reached the edge of the forest, his phone buzzed. It was Lily,her voice calm but urgent.

"Alexander, the media has just reported that no bodies were found in the car crash. They've confirmed that no one was inside the vehicle when it exploded."


Alexander's heart skipped a beat. "So, Lily wasn't in the car?"

"No," Lily confirmed. "The authorities think it was staged to cover something up. Whoever set that explosion wanted to make it look like Lily was dead."


Alexander's thoughts immediately turned to Maxwell and Carolina. This had to be part of their plan. But why fake Lily's death? He knew that now,more than ever, he had to find Lily before anyone else did.




Meanwhile, back at the mansion, Carolina was growing increasingly frustrated. She hadn't anticipated Ariana's bold move, and now her carefully laid plans were in jeopardy. Pacing the floor of her grand office,she snapped at her assistant, who stood nervously by the door.
"Find out where Ariana went!" Carolina barked. "And get me Maxwell. We need to get back on track before everything falls apart."

The assistant nodded and quickly left the room,leaving Carolina to stew in her anger. She had always controlled the narrative, pulling the strings from behind the scenes, but now everything seemed to be unraveling. And it wasn't just Ariana. Carolina's instincts told her that something else was coming-something even more dangerous than her own daughter's betrayal.

As Carolina's frustration boiled over, her phone buzzed. It was a message from a hidden source, one of her deep contacts within the government.

"Your operation is compromised. Pull out or face the consequences."

Carolina's eyes widened. For the first time in years, she felt fear creep into her heart. Someone was working against her from the inside.




Elsewhere,Ariana and Maxwell had formed a tense partnership.Seated in a dimly lit safe house far from the estate, Maxwell couldn't help but admíre Ariana's audacity. She had single-handedly disrupted Carolina's plans and now held the upper hand.

"You're playing a dangerous game," Maxwell said, leaning back in his chair. "You realize your mother won't let this go."

Ariana smirked. "She's had her turn. Now it's mine. Besides, I know her better than anyone. She'll try to counter, but I'm already two steps ahead."

Maxwell raised an eyebrow. "And what about Alexander? He's not the type to sit idly by while you tear everything apart."
Ariana's smile faded slightly. "Alexander will come looking for answers,but by the time he does, it'll be too late. He thinks he can stop this, but he doesn't know what's really going on."

"And what is really going on?" Maxwell asked, intrigued.

Ariana leaned in closer, her voice lowering. "There's a bigger game at play here. My mother's ambitions are small compared to what I have in mind.She's been manipulating people for years, but I have access to something she doesn't. A power that can change everything."

Maxwell frowned. "What are you talking about?"

Ariana didn't answer directly. Instead, she pulled out a small flash drive and slid it across the table. "This holds the key to everything. With it, we can bring down my mother, Alexander, and anyone else who stands in our way."


Maxwell picked up the drive, his curiosity piqued. "What's on this?"

"Proof," Ariana said, her voice cold. "Proof that Carolina has been involved in far more than just petty power games. She's tied to a global network that's been controlling governments and corporations for decades. And with this, we can expose her-and take her place."

Maxwell's mind raced. This was far bigger than he had anticipated. If Ariana was telling the truth, they were on the verge of toppling not just Carolina, but an entire empire.




Back in the forest, Alexander continued moving cautiously, making his way to a rendezvous point where he hoped to meet with Caleb and Lily.The air was tense, and every shadow felt like a potential threat.
Suddenly.his phone buzzed again. It was a message from an unknown number.


"Meet me at the old factory. Come alone if you want answers."

Alexander stared at the message, his mind racing. It could be a trap, but it was also his only lead. He knew that if he didn't act now, he might lose his chance to uncover the truth behind everything that had been happening.

Without hesitation. Alexander changed direction and headed toward the old factory. As he approached the crumbling structure, his senses were on high alert. He mnoved quietly, scanning the area for any signs of danger.

Inside the factory, the atmosphere was thick with dust and decay. The beams of light from the setting sun cast long shadows across the floor,giving the place an eerie, abandoned feel. Alexander's footsteps echoed as he moved deeper into the building.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows.

It was Caleb.

"I knew you'd come," Caleb said, his expression grim.


Alexander frowned. "What's going on? Who sent that message?"

Caleb shook his head. "It wasn't me. But we need to talk."

"About what?"

"About Ariana," Caleb said, stepping closer. "And the real reason she turned against her mother."

Alexander's eyes narrowed. "What do you know?"
Caleb sighed. "More than I wanted to. Ariana's not just after revenge. She's after something much bigger-a network that controls more than just Carolina's empire. It's a global organization, and Ariana's been in contact with them for years."

Alexander was stunned. "You're saying Ariana's been working with them all this time?"

"Not exactly," Caleb explained. "She's been playing both sides,waiting for the right moment to take control. But now that her mother's empire is crumbling, she's making her move."

"So what's her endgame?" Alexander asked, his mind spinning.

Caleb looked him in the eye. "She wants to take over the network and reshape the world in her image."

Alexander's heart raced. The stakes were far higher than he had realized.Ariana wasn't just fighting for power-she was fighting for control over the entire system. And if she succeeded, there would be no stopping her.
###Chapter 160

Alexander's mind whirled as Caleb's words sank in. Ariana's ambitions stretched far beyond family feuds or simple revenge. This was a global takeover in the making, and she was willing to dismantle everything-her mother's empire, their alliances, even their lives-to achieve it.

"So, what's your plan. Caleb?" Alexander asked, his voice low but urgent. "You didn't come here just to warn me. You want something from me. don't you?"


Caleb glanced around the dimly lit factory, making sure they were still alone. He took a deep breath before replying. "I've been keeping an eye on Ariana's moves for months, watching her build alliances and collect information on the network. I thought I could handle it alone, but she's grown more dangerous than I ever imagined. We can't stop her unless we work together."


Alexander narrowed his eyes, not fully trusting Caleb's sudden change of heart. "And what makes you think I'll help you after everything? For all I know, you could be leading me into another trap."

Caleb smírked, a hint of regret flashing in his eyes. "I get it. I've made my mistakes, and you have every reason to doubt me. But I'm not doing this just for you-or for me. If Ariana gains control, she'll reshape the world in her own twisted vision. She's not after justice, Alexander-she's after absolute power. And she's willing to burn down anyone in her way."

Alexander's jaw clenched. He hated the idea of needing Caleb's help, but he couldn't ignore the truth in his words. Ariana's ruthlessness had become all too clear, and if she truly planned to seize control of a shadowy network with global reach, they were facing a crisis that could upend
everything.

"Fine," Alexander finally said, extending a hand. "For now, we work together. But the moment you cross me. Caleb, this alliance ends.Understand?"

Caleb nodded, shaking Alexander's hand with a firm grip. "Understood.
Now let's find a way to stay one step ahead of Ariana before it's too late."




Meanwhile, at a secluided estate on the outskirts of town, Maxwell sat across from Ariana in a dimly lit room, the flash drive resting between them on a polished oak table. Ariana leaned forward, her eyes gleaming with a cold intensity.

"Maxwell, you have no idea how long I've been waiting for this moment,"she said, her voice smooth and confident. "With this, I can not only destroy my mother's influence but also secure my place within the network. They'll have no choice but to accept me as their new leader."

Maxwell watched her closely, hiding his unease behind a mask of indifference. "You really think they'll let you take over that easily? These people have been running the world from the shadows for decades. They don't just hand over power to anyone who demands it."

Ariana's smile widened. "That's where you're wrong, Maxwell. They don't know what I have on them-the secrets buried in this drive. If they refuse,I'll expose them to the world. They'll have no choice but to back down or face the fallout. And once they're out of the way, I'll reshape their network into something far more...efficient."

Maxwell suppressed a shudder. He had never seen this side of Ariana
before-the calculated, almost fanatical ambition in her eyes. Part of him wondered if he had made a terrible mistake by aligning himself with her.But he knew there was no turning back now.




Back in the city, the media outlets were abuzz with the latest revelation:the car that had been thought to hold Lily was actually empty. Speculation ran wild, with theories ranging from a botched assassination attempt to a staged disappearance. Reporters and pundits debated the implications on every news channel, turning the mysterious car crash into the top headline of the day.


Alexander caught a glimpse of the breaking news on a TV screen as he and Caleb drove through the city. He couldn't help but feel a flicker of relief-Lily was safe, at least for now. But the question remained: where was she hiding, and how long would it take before Ariana or Carolina found her?


Caleb glanced sideways at Alexander as he navigated through the city's winding streets. "Any idea where Lily might be? If she's smart, she'll keep her distance until we figure out our next move."

Alexander shook his head, his expression troubled. "I don't know,but I have a feeling she'll find a way to contact us soon. Lily always has a plan,even when things look bleak."


Just then, Alexander's phone buzzed. He glanced down to see a message from an unknown number.

"Meet me at the old pier at midnight. Come alone."

Alexander's pulse quickened. It could be a trap, but it could also be the
lead they desperately needed. He showed the message to Caleb, who nodded grimly.


"Looks like we're not done with surprises tonight," Caleb said.




Across town, Carolina stood in her study, her hands gripping the edge of her desk as she watched the news coverage. She had just learned about the empty car and the speculation surrounding Lily's supposed death.Her anger simmered beneath the surface, a fire that threatened to consume her.

"First Ariana, now this," Carolina muttered to herself. "They think they can outsmart me. They think they can take everything I've built and turn it against me."


She turned to face the room, where a collection of photos and documents lined the walls-evidence of her connections and influence, the network she had spent years cultivating. But now, she felt it slipping through her fingers, and the realization made her blood boil.

Carolina reached for her phone and dialed a secure number. When the line clicked open, she spoke with a tone of iron resolve.

"Activate our sleeper agents. If Ariana wants to play this game, she'll soon learn what it means to cross me. And as for Alexander and Caleb... make sure they understand the consequences of their defiance."


As Carolína gave her orders, a shadowy figure on the other end of the line acknowledged her instructions with a curt "Yes, ma'am," before disconnecting.

Carolina's gaze drifted to a framed photo on her desk-one of her and Ariana during happier times. She picked it up, her fingers brushing over
the glass, then slammed it face down on the desk.




At the old pier, the air was thick with tension as Alexander arrived, the sound of waves crashing against the docks filling the silence. He scanned the shadows, waiting for the mysterious contact to reveal themselves.

Out of the darkness, Lily emerged, her expression determined but weary.She met Alexander's gaze with a mixture of relief and urgency.

"I knew you'd come," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Lily," Alexander said, stepping closer. "We don't have much time. Ariana's making her move, and Carolina's already fighting back. Whatever game they're playing, it's tearing everything apart."

Lily nodded, a grim smile crossing her lips. "I know. But thee's more you need to understand. Ariana isn't just trying to take down Carolina-she's trying to reshape everything. And she's got leverage on the network that even Carolina doesn't know about."


Alexander frowned. "Leverage? What are you talking about?"

Lily reached into her coat and pulled out a small notebook, its pages filled with coded messages and detailed notes. "Ariana's been gathering intel on the network's leaders for years. She has enough dirt on them to bring their entíre operation crashing down. If she gets control, she won't just stop with Carolina. She'll go after anyone who stands in her way-including us.



Alexander took the notebook, flipping through its pages as the weight of the situation settled on him. The stakes were higher than ever, and now,more than ever, they would need to find a way to outmaneuver Ariana
before she could execute her plan.

But as they stood there,a shadowy figure watched from the distance, a hint of a smile curling their lips. The game was far from over, and the next move would be a deadly one.
###Chapter 161

At a hidden underground facility on the outskirts of the city, the hum of machinery and the glow of surveillance monitors filled the dimly lit space.Inside, a team of analysts and operatives busily tracked the movements of key players in the ongoing power struggle. This was the clandestine headquarters of a faction that had been operating in the shadows,monitoring the chaos between Ariana, Alexander, and Carolina.

A tall figure, known only as The Overseer, stood before a massive screen that displayed satellite images and intercepted communications. Their face remained hidden beneath a hood, but their voice carried a quiet authority that demanded respect.

"Report," The Overseer said, turning to a woman seated at a control panel.

The woman, adjusting her headset, glanced up at her superior. "We've confirmed that Ariana has made her first move against Carolina, but it's more complex than anticipated. There's chatter suggesting she's got leverage over high-ranking members of the network. If she follows through.she could destabilize operations across several regions."

The Overseer nodded slowly, considering the implications. "And what about Alexander and Caleb? How do they fit into this?"

"They're a wildcard, sir," she replied. "It seems they're attempting to disrupt Ariana's plans, but their coordination is still shaky.Caleb is trying to regain some control over the situation, but Alexander is driven by personnal motives, particularly concerning Lily. It makes their alliance fragile."


The Overseer turned back to the screen, their thoughts racing. They had spent years building a delicate balance among the network's factions,
ensuring that no single entity could dominate the others. But with Ariana'
s bold moves and Carolina's retaliation, that balance was now in jeopardy.

"Double our surveillance on Ariana's known associates and assets," The Overseer ordered. "And keep a close eye on Caleb and Alexander. If their alliance fractures, it could give us an opportunity to regain control of the situation before it spirals further."

The woman nodded and relayed the commands to the rest of the team,who immediately began adjusting their systems. The Overseer watched as new data streamed in, maps lighting up with red markers indicating locations of interest. It was clear that whatever game Ariana, Carolina, and their rivals were playing, it had attracted the attention of those who had a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.




Meanwhile, in a secluded mountain hideout far from the city,Ariana had set up a temporary base of operations. The isolated location allowedher to plan without fear of immediate retaliation. She paced back and forth in front of a holographic map of the region, her mind working through the next steps of her strategy.

Suddenly, the door to the room creaked open, and Maxwell walked in, a concerned look on his face. "Ariana, there's been a development," he said,handing her a tablet that displayed a news article. "The media is now reporting that no one was in the car that burned. They're speculating that it mnight have been a decoy."

Ariana's eyes narrowed as she scanned the report. Her frustration flared,but she quickly composed herself, her mind racing to adjust her plans. "So,Lily managed to escape," she murmured. "She's more resourceful than I gave her credit for. But it doesn't matter. It just means the game isn't over
yet."

Maxwell hesitated, choosing his words carefully. "If Lily's alive. Alexander and Caleb will be even more determined to stop you. We need to move faster before they regroup."

Ariana shot him a sharp glance. "I don't need you reminding me of the stakes.Maxwell. I've come too far to be derailed now. Let Alexander and Caleb scramble in the dark-they don't understand the bigger picture.And as for my mother... she'll soon realize that I've outgrown her shadow.



Maxwell nodded, but he couldn't shake the uneasy feeling that gnawed at him. He wondered if Ariana truly understood how far she was willing to go-and if she had underestimated how much she had already lost in her quest for power.




Across the country. Carolina sat in her office, high up in a skyscraper that overlooked the city skyline. Her fingers drummed against her polished desk as she reviewed the latest intelligence reports from her own network of spies. She had just received word of Ariana's movements, as well as rumors of Alexander and Caleb's new alliance.


"How predictable," she muttered to herself. "They think they can outmaneuver me. But they don't realize that I've been preparing for this since the day Ariana started showing signs of her rebellion."

Carolina's phone rang, and she answered it without looking at the screen.A gruff voice came through the speaker. "Ma'am, our contacts have located one of Ariana's safe houses. Should we proceed with the strike?"
A slow, cold smile spread across Carolina's face. "No, not yet. Let her think she's still one step ahead. But keep a close watch on the location-if she makes a move. I want to know immediately. And keep the pressure on Alexander and Caleb. They might think they're free agents, but they're still playing on my board."

Carolina ended the call and leaned back in her chair, staring out at the twinkling lights of the city. Despite her outward confidence, a small part of her wondered if Ariana's ambitions had grown beyond her control. She thought back to the early days, when she had trained her daughter in the art of manipulation.and power plays. Had she created something she could no longer control?




In another part of the city, Jacob and Michael were on the move,following a lead that they hoped would give them the upper hand against Ariana.They navigated through the bustling streets, blending in with the evening crowd.


"Are you sure this contact of yours is reliable?" Jacob asked, glancing at Michael as they approached a nondescript warehouse.

Michael shrugged. "As reliable as anyone in this business. They've got eyes on some of Ariana's movements, and they want to stay out of the crossfire. If they're willing to share information, we'd be fools to ignore it."

They entered the warehouse, where a shadowy figure awaited them in the dim light. The contact stepped forward, pulling back a hood to reveal a familiar face-Samson, the former ally who had once worked for Ariana before defecting.

"Samson," Michael said with a mixture of surprise and suspicion. "You're
the one feeding us intel?"

Samson gave a grim nod. "Yeah. I figured it's time to even the playing field a bit. Ariana's gone too far, and she's burning through her alliances faster than she realizes. I've got information on her next target-something she's keeping hidden from even her closest allies. But if you want it, you'll have to trust me."

Jacob folded his arms, eyeing Samson skeptically. "And why should we trust someone who was part of Ariana's crew? What's your angle in all this?"


Samson sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. "Let's just say I don't want to end up collateral damage in Ariana's little power trip. I know I'm not a saint, but I'd rather work with you guys than watch her tear everything apart. So, do we have a deal?"

Jacob and Michael exchanged a glance, silently weighing their options.Finally, Jacob extended his hand. "Deal. But if you double-cross us,you'll regret it."


Samson shook Jacob's hand with a rueful smile. "Believe me, I know better than to cross you."


As the three of them sat down to review the latest intel, they had no idea that across the city, The Overseer and their faction were already preparing to intervene, with their own agenda for how this power struggle should unfold.





In the shadows of this intricate game, alliances were being formed, broken.and reformed, with each player holding secrets that could shatter the
others' plans. As Alexander. Caleb, Carolina, and Ariana moved their pieces across the board, they remained unaware that a new power was watching them closely, ready to tip the scales when the time was right.And amidst it all, the question loomed: who would emerge victorious,and who would fall in the face of ambitions too great to contain?
###Chapter 162

As the wheels of fate continued to turn, the battle between Ariana, Carolina,and the others became more tangled. The city itself seemed to hold its breath,waiting for the next move in a game that had spiraled beyond mere rivalries. But while each of them focused on their plans, they remained unaware of a deeper conspiracy unraveling beneath the surface-one that could shift the entire balance of power.




**In a Remote Safehouse, Near the Border:**

Ariana moved quickly through the rooms of her hideout, scanning the map on her tablet. The place was sparse, with only the essentials for her to operate in secret, but she preferred it that way. Maxwell was nearby,monitoring communication channels for any signs of a counterattack from Caleb or Carolina's people. He glanced at Ariana, a trace of doubt in his expression.


"You know, you're pushing hard," Maxwell said, his voice low. "We've dodged them so far, but sooner or later, they'll catch up. Maybe we should lay low for a while-wait for things to cool off."

Ariana shot him a cold look. "You think I don't know that? But if I back down now, they'll never take me seriously. My mother's already trying to undermine me, and Caleb and Alexander are just looking for a reason to strike. I need to show them that I'm in control."

Maxwell opened his mouth to respond, but just as he did, a blaring alarm filled the room. He quickly turned to his terminal, his fingers flying across the keyboard. "We've got a breach-someone's trying to hack into our encrypted lines."
Ariana's eyes narrowed, and she leaned over his shoulder to look at the screen. "Can you trace it?"

"Already on it," Maxwell replied. "But whoever this is, they're good. I'll need a few minutes."


Ariana clenched her jaw. "We don't have a few minutes. Whoever's behind this, they're likely trying to pinpoint our location. We need to move now."


But just as they prepared to leave, the hacking attemnpt abruptly stopped,replaced by a message on the screen: *We're closer than you think.*

Ariana felt a chill run down her spine. She knew the message was meant to intimidate her, to make her question how secure she truly was.She glanced back at Maxwell, who shook his head, frustrated at their vulnerability.

"Pack up," she ordered. "We're relocating. And this time,we disappear completely."




**In the Heart of the City,Carolina's Office:**

Carolina paced back and forth in her office,her mind racing with thoughts of Ariana's defiance and Alexander's interference. Her grip tightened around the glass in her hand, nearly shattering it. She had underestimated Ariana's resilience, but it wasn't the first time someone close to her had tried to seize control.


She dialed a number on her phone, waiting impatiently as the line connected. When the call went through, she wasted no time. "I want a full sweep of Ariana's last known locations. And track Alexander as well.He
thinks he's untouchable, but he's made himself vulnerable by playing the hero."

A smooth voice responded on the other end. "Consider it done,ma'am.But be aware, there are rumors circulating about a new player. A group operating out of the old city tunnels, intercepting communications between all parties involved. They might be the ones behind that disruption in Ariana's safehouse."


Carolina's expression darkened, but she kept her voice steady. "Find out everything you can about this new faction. I don't care who they are or what they want-if they're meddling in my affairs, they'll regret it."

She ended the call and sank back into her chair, staring at the city skyline with a hardened gaze. As much as she hated to admit it, she knew she couldn't control everything anymore. The game was shifting, and she needed to adapt or risk being outplayed by forces she couldn't yet understand.




**A Hidden Bunker Beneath the City:**

The Overseer watched as their team of operatives meticulously pieced together the movements of the players above. On the screens, live feeds showed Ariana's retreat from her hideout, Carolina's growing impatience,and Alexander's determination to find Lily.

A new figure entered the room, a younger operative with a folder in hand."We've confirmed that Ariana has received our message," he reported. "She's on the move again, just as you predicted."

The Overseer turned, the faintest hint of a smile crossing their lips. "Good.
Let her run. It keeps her distracted and predictable. And what of Carolina and Caleb?"


"Carolina is intensifying her surveillance on Alexander, but she doesn't realize how closely we've been watching her moves as well. Caleb, on the other hand, is trying to consolidate power with Alexander, but his focus is still on keeping Lily safe."

The Overseer's smile faded. "They're all so consumed with their own vendettas that they haven't even considered the bigger picture. But it's time we made our presence known. Prepare the next phase of the operation. We'll force them to see that they are merely players in a larger game."


The operative nodded and left, leaving The Overseer alone with their thoughts. They stared at the screens, each showing a different piece of the unfolding drama. The Overseer knew that the time would soon come to reveal their true intentions, and when that happened,none of the factions would see it coming.




**Back at Alexander's Residence:**

Alexander sat in his study, the curtains drawn to keep out the city's glare.He'd spent the past few hours poring over documents and maps, trying to piece together Ariana's next move. But his mind kept drifting back to Lily.He had felt a surge of relief when the news confirmed that no one had been in the burning car, but that relief was quickly replaced with worry.Where was she now, and how much danger was she truly in?

Caleb entered the room, his face grave. "You're still thinking about her.aren't you?" he asked, closing the door behind him. "You know we have
to stay focused if we want to take down Ariana."

Alexander sighed, leaning back in his chair. "I know. But Lily is at the center of all of this. If we can protect her, we can force Ariana's hand.She's already made it clear that she won't stop until she wins this war."

Caleb sat across from him, a thoughtful look on his face. "I spoke with our contacts in the underground. They're picking up chatter about a group operating in the shadows-some sort of organized force trying to play all sides against each other."

Alexander frowned, his interest piqued. "What do they want?"

"That's the thing. No one knows," Caleb replied. "They seem to have access to resources that could tip the balance, but they're keeping their intentions hidden. It's possible they're the ones who drove Ariana out of her safehouse."


Alexander's expression hardened as he processed this new information. "If there's another player in this game, we need to find out who they are before they decide to turn their attention on us. Let's start digging deeper,Caleb. If Ariana, Carolina, and this new group think they can outmaneuver us, they're in for a surprise."




**Somewhere in a Remote Wilderness:**


Lily crouched beside a hidden stream, listening to the rush of water as she caught her breath. She had been on the run for days, using the wilderness as her shield against those hunting her. Despite the danger,a small smile crossed her lips. She had survived Ariana's trap and outsmarted those who thought they could control her fate.
She looked down at the burner phone in her hand, considering her next move. She knew that Alexander and Caleb were searching for her, but she wasn't ready to return to them-not until she could be certain that she wouldn't bring more danger with her. She also knew that Ariana wouldn't stop until she had settled their score, which meant that Lily needed to stay one step ahead.


"Let's see how they like being the ones in the dark," she whispered to herself as she dialed a number she had been keeping for an emergency.

The voice on the other end was brisk and professional. "Did you find a safe location?"


"For now," Lily replied. "But I need more than just a hiding spot. I need information-on Ariana, on the new group, on everything that's been happening in the city. And I need it fast."


The voice hesitated, then responded. "Understood. We'll get you what you need. But remember, there's no going back once you start this. You'll be on your own."

Lily's smile grew colder. "I've been on my own for a long time. Just make sure you deliver."


As she ended the call, she stood up and glanced around at the dense forest,knowing that she was entering a new phase of the battle-one where she wouldn't just be a target, but a player in her own right.




In the intricate web of alliances, betrayals, and hidden agendas, each move now carried greater consequences. Alexander and Caleb sought to unravel the mysteries behind Ariana's actions and the shadowy new faction,while
Carolina struggled to maintain her grip on power. And as Lily prepared to strike back, the game's true complexity was beginning to unfold,with The Overseer watching,waiting for the right moment to change the rules.
###Chapter 163

**Back in the City: A Brewing Storm**

The city remained a battlefield, with every faction maneuvering for control and supremacy. But just as tensions reached a boiling point, a new storm was on the horizon-one that no one saw coming.




**Ariana's Hideout. Deep in the Forest:**


Ariana's escape had given her time to regroup, but she was aware that every passing minute allowed her enemies to grow stronger. The forest around her was thick with shadows, and she moved cautiously, even as her thoughts swirled with fury and determination. Maxwell had set up a new communication line, using a more secure connection to avoid another breach.


She dialed a number, her hands trembling with the weight of her next move. The line crackled, then a voice on the other end picked up-Carolina. Ariana could hear the tension in her mother's voice, a mixture of anger and exasperation.


"Why are you calling me, Ariana?" Carolina demanded, her voice dripping with contempt. "You've already made it clear that you want nothing to do with me or my plans,"


Ariana took a deep breath, choosing her words carefully. "You may hate me, Mother, but we have a common enemy now. Alexander and Caleb are getting too close. They think they can play us against each other,but they don't realize how dangerous we can be when we're united."
Carolina laughed bitterly. "You think I'd ever trust you again? You've always been a disappointment. Ariana-unpredictable and reckless. You can't even control your own ambition, let alone align with mine."

Ariana's grip on the phone tightened, her voice turning cold. "You might think I'm reckless, but I know how to get results. If you won't work with me. I'll make sure you regret it when you're left standing alone against them."


Carolina hesitated for a moment, weighing her options. She didn't fully trust Ariana, but she also knew that she couldn't afford to face Alexander,Caleb, and the mysterious new faction without additional leverage. "Fine,"she said at last. "But this doesn't mean we're allies. The moment you try to cross me, you'll regret it."

Ariana smiled, a small victory in her grasp. "I'll keep that in mind. Let's show them what happens when they think they can outsmart us."




**In a Dimly Lit Bar, on the Outskirts of the City:**

Caleb sat in the shadows, nursing a glass of whiskey. His mind was filled with thoughts of the mnysterious new faction that had emerged, and he knew that their appearance could change everything. But he had no intention of letting their plans derail his own.

A figure approached his table, sliding into the seat across from him. It was a contact from the underground-a former intelligence operative named Victor. He had once worked for Carolina but had grown disillusioned with her ruthless tactics.


Victor leaned forward, speaking in a hushed tone. "There's been more
chatter about the group operating beneath the city. They call themselves The Conclave. They've been gathering intel on all of us-Ariana, Carolina,Alexander, even you."

Caleb raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "What do they want?"

"No one knows for sure," Victor replied. "But rumor has it they're not interested in taking sides. They're playing a long game,waiting for the right moment to tip the balance. If they decide to intervene, it won't be for anyone's benefit but their own."


Caleb took a long sip of his drink, considering this new information. "Keep your ear to the ground, Victor. If The Conclave thinks they can manipulate us. they're sorely mistaken. I want to know their every move before they make it."


Victor nodded and disappeared into the shadows,leaving Caleb alone with his thoughts. The game was becoming more complex bythe day,but he knew that if he could outmaneuver both Ariana and The Conclave,he would come out on top.




**At a Secret Safehouse,Lily's Location:**


Lily had found temporary refuge in a smalI safehouse on the outskirts of town, far from the eyes of those searching for her. She kept herself busy.combing through the information she had received from her mysterious contacts. Names, dates,locations-all the pieces were there, but they were scattered, like a puzzle that had yet to be put together.

As she worked, her thoughts kept returning to Alexander. She had seen the desperation in his eyes, the way he had fought to find her. Part of her
wanted to reach out, to let him know she was safe. But she knew that contacting him now would only put him in greater danger.

Instead,she focused on the bigger picture. She had learned about The Conclave and their role in manipulating events from behind the scenes.And she knew that if she could expose their plans, she might be able to turn the tide in her favor.


Lily picked up her burner phone and dialed another contact-a former journalist who had gone underground after crossing paths with Carolina.The phone rang twice before the voice on the other end answered.

"Are you ready to make some noise?" Lily asked, her voice steady.

The journalist chuckled. "I've been waiting for a story like this. What have you got for me?"

"Proof of a hidden faction pulling strings behind the scenes. I need you to get this information out to the public, make it impossible for them to operate in the shadows."


There was a pause, then a slow, approving response. "Consider it done.But be careful, Lily. You're playing with fire."

Lily smiled, a glint of determination in her eyes. "That's the only way to win,isn't it?"




**InThe Conclave's Hidden Bunker:**

The Overseer observed as new informnation began to leak into the public domain. Reports of a hidden faction manipulating events spread like wildfire, and whispers of The Conclave reached even the ears of the
common people. The Overseer's lips curled into a smirk. It was a move they had anticipated, but one that still served their purpose.

A new figure approached them, dressed in the nondescript clothing of an operative. "The leaks are spreading faster than we expected. Do you want us to intervene?"


The Overseer shook their head. "No, let them talk. It creates uncertainty among our enemies. Carolina wwill grow paranoid, Ariana will scramble to adapt, and Alexander will struggle to protect Lily. It's time to turn the heat up and see who can survive the fire."


The operative nodded and left the room, leaving The Overseer to contemplate their next move. They knew that the time for subtle manipulation was ending. Soon, they would step out of the shadows,and when they did, the power struggle in the city would change forever.




**Back at Alexander's Residence:**

Alexander's phone buzzed, and he glanced at the new headline flashing across the screen. *Mystery Faction Manipulating City Power Struggle-The Conclave Exposed?* He read the article with growing unease, realizing that Lily had taken a bold step to force the truth into the light.

He turned to Caleb, who had just entered the room, holding a similar report. "Looks like Lily beat us to it," Alexander said, a mix of pride and frustratíon in his voice. "She's exposing The Conclave. But this could make things even more dangerous for her."


Caleb nodded, scanning the report. "It's a risky move, but it's one that might give us the leverage we need. If The Conclave feels threatened, they
might make a mistake. And that's when we strike."

Alexander met Caleb's gaze, a new determination forming. "Then we use this chaos to our advantage. It's time to take the fight to Ariana,Carolina,and The Conclave. And we won't stop until we end this once and for all."




**At Carolina's Mansion:**

Carolina read the headlines with growing rage. She had spent years building her influence, keeping her secrets well-guarded. Now, The Conclave's existence was out in the open, and the city was rife with speculation about who had been pulling the strings all along. Her fingers tightened around the glass she held, and she hurled it across the room,watching it shatter against the wall.

"Who leaked this?" she demanded, turning to her inner circle. "Find out who's responsible and make sure they're silenced!"

One of her aides hesitated, then spoke up. "Ma'am, we believe it was Lily.She's been hiding under the radar, but it looks like she's working with a former journalist to expose The Conclave's activities."


Carolina's eyes narrowed, her anger shifting focus. "So the little girl thinks she can play the game. Fine. Let her try. I'll make sure she regrets ever crossing me."




With The Conclave exposed and tensions reaching a boiling point, the city found itself on the edge of chaos. The power struggle had expanded beyond personal vendettas, turning intoa war for control over the city's future. And as each faction prepared to make their next move, the battle

###Chapter 164

The city buzzed with the news of The Conclave's exposure, and the once shadowy whispers had now become open secrets. The factions scrambled to regroup, recalibrate, and reassess their positions,knowing that one wrong move could spell their end. Yet, amidst this frenzy, deeper plots began to unfold-secrets within secrets, alliances built on fragile trust, and a revelation that would shake all their plans.

Alexander sat in his safe house, pouring over the newly released information about The Conclave. Lily's leak had thrown everything into disarray, and while he admired her boldness, he worried about the repercussions it might have on their already perilous situation. Caleb sat across from him, deep in thought.

"She's put herself right in the line of fire,” Caleb said, breaking the silence."Now that she's exposed The Conclave, they'll stop at nothing to eliminate her. If we don't act quickly, she might not survive the fallout.”

Alexander nodded. “I'm aware, but this could be our chance to strike back.
If we can disrupt The Conclave's operations before they retaliate,we might have a chance to-”

Before he could finish, his phone buzzed with a private message. He glanced at the screen, his brow furrowing as he read the anonymous text: *"Meet me at the old factory by midnight. Come alone, or she dies."*

Alexander's breath caught. It wasn't signed, but he could sense the gravity of the situation. He showed the message to Caleb, who studied it with concern.

"It could be a trap," Caleb warned. "But if it's about Lily, we can't ignore it.”
“I'm going," Alexander said, determination hardening his voice.“I'll handle this myself. Keep the others on standby in case thing go south."

Alexander arrived at the dilapidated old factory on the outskirts of town,its windows broken and walls crumbling with age. The wind howled through the empty halls, carrying with it an air of foreboding. As he stepped inside,the shadows seemed to close in around him.

A figure emerged from the darkness, and Alexander's eyes widened in surprise-it was Ariana, her face bruised and clothes torn, as if she had barely escaped a vicious attack.

"You?" Alexander's voice was filled with confusion and suspicion. “What are you playing at. Ariana?”"

She held up her hands, as if in surrender. “You think I planned this? The Conclave turned on me. They wanted me out of the picture just as much as they wanted to get rid of you. I barely got away with my life."

Alexander narrowed his eyes, trying to gauge the truth in her words. “Why should I believe you?”

Ariana stepped closer, her voice low and urgent. “Because they're not who you think they are, Alexander. The Conclave has been playing both sides.They've been feeding information to Caleb behind your back, manipulating your every move,”


Alexander froze, his mind racing. He had known there were leaks in his organization, but Caleb? It was impossible-Caleb had been like a brother to him. But as the pieces began to fit together, doubt crept in.

Seeing his reaction, Ariana pressed on. "They have bigger plans, Alexander.Exposing them was just the beginning. They want to create chaos,to
watch us tear each other apart while they seize control of the city. And Caleb-he's been working with them to ensure that outcome."

Back at the headquarters, Caleb paced in his office, deep in thought. He had just received a message from Victor, who had managed to infiltrate The Conclave's ranks. But the information Victor had sent chilled him to the bone: *"They know about you, Caleb. They're coming for you next.Your usefulness has run out."*


His heart pounded as he realized the precarious position he wwas in.He had aligned with The Conclave, believing they would help hím secure power over the city, but it seemed they had other plans. And now, they intended to cut him loose.

Caleb's thoughts turned to Alexander. He had kept his dealings with The Conclave a secret, believing that he could protect both their interests. But now, he realized that his actions had made him a pawn in a much larger game. A part of him wondered if he should have trusted Alexander mnore,if they could have faced this threat together instead of working from the shadows.


Just then, the door to his office burst open, and Victor stumbled inside,clutching his side where a dark stain spread across his shirt.“They found me... I tried to warn you, but they got to me first."

Caleb rushed to Victor's side, helping him to a chair. "Who did this?"

Victor's voice was faint, his breaths labored. "The Conclave... they're here...They want to take you out before you can become a threat.”

Meanwhile, Carolina paced back and forth in her lavish penthouse,overlooking the city that she had once controlled from the shadows.Her anger boiled over as she watched the news unfold, with reports of The
Conclave's activities spreading like wildfire. But her fury wasn't just about the exposure-it was the realization that she was losing her grip over her own allies.


"Where is that girl?" she muttered under her breath, glaring out the window.Her thoughts turned to Ariana. "I warned her not to trust those outsiders, and now she's thrown us all into the fire."

One of her aides, a nervous young man who had been trying to stay out of her way, approached cautiously. “Ma'am, there's something else you should know. Maxwell has been meeting with The Conclave behind your back. He's... he's been planning to turn on you.”

Carolina's expression darkened further, a dangerous glint in her eye.“So,even Maxwell thinks he can betray me?" She turned sharply to her aide.“Get a message to him. Tell him that if he wants a war, he'll get one."

She picked up her phone, dialing a number she hadn't called in years-an old contact from her days in the underworld. When the line picked up,her voice was cold and unwavering. “I need you to take care of a problem.And make sure there's no trace left behind."

Alexander stood face to face with Ariana, struggling to process the revelations she had laid before him. Just as he opened his mouth to demand more answers, a series of gunshots echoed through the building.followed by the clatter of boots.

"They've found us," Ariana whispered urgently. "The Conclave isn't going to let us walk away from this. We need to move."

But before they could escape, masked figures burst into the room, weapons drawn. Alexander and Ariana exchanged a look-united by the realization that they were out of options.
They fought side by side, taking down the attackers with a mix of desperation and skill. But as the last of the masked figures fell,a familiar voice rang out from the shadows-Caleb's.


He stepped forward, his gun aimed squarely at Ariana."I should have known you'd try to drag him into your mess."

Alexander turned to face his former ally, a mixture of betrayal and disbelief on his face. “Caleb... tell me i's not true."

Caleb's expression softened for a moment, but then hardened again."I did what I had to, Alexander. I thought I could keep The Conclave under control, but they were playing us all along. And now, it's too late to go back.”


Ariana seized the moment, lunging for her weapon. But before she could reach it, a shot rang out, and she crumpled to the ground, clutching her side.


Alexander's shout echoed through the empty factory, and he rushed to Ariana's side, pressing his hands against the wound. "Stay with me!" he shouted, but her breathing grew more labored.

Caleb took a step forward, his face twisted with remorse. "I never wanted this, but now we have no choice. The Conclave is going to destroy us if we don't take them down first."


Alexander looked up at Caleb, anger and desperation warring in his eyes.“You better pray that you're right, because if she dies, there won't be a place in this world where you can hide."




As the two men faced the uncertain future before them, a new shadow
watched from the shadows-a member of The Conclave who had been recording every word. He slipped away unnoticed, a grim smile on his lips.

By dawn, The Conclave would know everything. And with Carolina,Maxwell, and even Alexander now entangled in their web,the stage was set for a confrontation that would leave no one unscathed.


But there was one final twist that no one could predict-Lily,who had been following the clues to the factory, arrived just in time to witness the scene. Hidden behind a crumbling wall, she watched the aftermath unfold,her mind racing with new plans. With everyone distracted, she saw an opportunity-a way to turn the tables on The Conclave, save those she cared about, and rewrite the rules of the game.


As she slipped back into the shadows, one thought filled her mind: *This battle is far from over.*


And with that, the city braced for the storm that was about to break,knowing that the next move could change everything-and that the final game was only just beginning.
###Chapter 165

Lily confronted Carolina with a sharp, cold gaze. "Your games are over.Carolina. You and Ariana thought you could twist everyone around your fingers, but you have no idea what's coming for you."

Carolina's frustration bubbled over. "You think you're better than us, Lily?You've always acted so righteous, but you're just as trapped in this mess as the rest of us."


Lily's expression remained unwavering. "No, I'm nothing like you.Unlike you, I don't betray those I love. You should have known better than to drag your daughter into this."


Ariana, standing by her mother, started to falter. She had thought she could rely on her mother's strength and cunning, but seeing Lily's conviction made her realize how deep they had sunk. "Mom, maybe we should-"


Carolina cut her off sharply. “No, we will not back down. Lily is just bluffing.”


But Lily had no intention of bluffing. Her real plan was unfolding in the shadows, orchestrated with Alexander's knowledge. She wanted to ensure that Carolina and Ariana's schemes would be exposed, leaving them with no escape from justice.

Meanwhile, Alexander, from the safety of a secure location, was in constant contact with Caleb, who kept him updated on the unfolding events. Caleb,Lily's grandfather, had always been a guiding figure for her. His support meant that Alexander could trust in the plan, knowing that Lily was working on their side to bring Carolina and Ariana's crimes to light.
As Lily maintained her cool stance before Carolina, sirens could be heard in the distance. The authorities were closing in, thanks to the evidence that Lily had meticulously gathered. Carolina's facepaled as she realized that their carefully built lies and manipulations were crumbling around them.

"You did this!" Carolina hissed, pointing an accusing finger at Lily.

Lily didn't flinch. "Yes, I did. And I did it for my family, for the people you've hurt without a second thought."


Ariana,realizing they were trapped, glanced at her mother. Desperation filled her eyes. “Mom, what do we do now?”


But it was too late for Carolina. The police arrived, surrounding them, and Lily stepped back, watching as the officers began to close in. She knew this would be the end of Carolina and Ariana's reign of manipulation.

Lily's thoughts turned to Alexander, knowing that soon they could finally start putting the past behind them, free from the shadows of Carolina and Ariana's influence.


As the police closed in on Carolina and Ariana, Lily took a step back, her face a mask of calm satisfaction. Carolina, realizing that her time was up,tried to make one last desperate plea. "You think this is the end, Lily? You don't know what you're dealing with. There are things you'll never understand,people who won't let this go."


Lily's expression hardened. “You're wrong, Carolina. I know exactly what I'm dealing with. And I'm not afraid of you or anyone else."

The officers moved in swiftly, securing Carolina and Ariana in handcuffs.Ariana looked dazed, her face reflecting a mixture of betrayal and disbelief.She glanced at her mother, searching for the usual confidence that guided
them through so many schemes, but all she found was fear in Carolina's eyes.

As the two were escorted into the police cars, Carolina shot Lily a venomous look. “This isn't over. You'll regret this, Lily. I promise you.”

Lily didn't respond, simply turning her back on Carolina as the car doors slammed shut. She had no interest in listening to Carolina's empty threats.Her priority was ensuring her family's safety, and she knew that removing Carolina and Ariana from the picture was a necessary step.

Meanwhile,Alexander watched the scene unfold through a secure video feed Caleb had set up. He couldn't help but feel a deep sense of relief knowing that Lily had come through for them. "She did it, Caleb,"Alexander said, his voice filled with a mix of pride and gratitude.

Caleb,who stood by Alexander's side, nodded. “She's always been stronger than she looks. You chose well, Alexander.”

Alexander smiled faintly. “I always knew she had a fire in her. But this...she's done more than I ever could have imagined.”


Caleb placed a reassuring hand on Alexander's shoulder. "Now it's time to focus on what's next. Carolina and Ariana are out of the way, but there's still plenty to clean up. Their allies won't be happy about this."


Back at their home, Lily arrived to find Alexander waiting for her. She embraced him tightly, burying her face in his shoulder. “It's finally over.Alexander. They're going to pay for everything they did.”

He held her close, feeling the tension in her shoulders slowly fade.“You were amazing out there, Lily. You did what needed to be done."

She looked up at him, determination still burning in her eyes. “We're not
completely free yet. Carolina's allies might try to retaliate. But whatever comes, we'll face it together.”

Alexander nodded, knowing that their battle wasn't entirely over. But they had crossed a significant hurdle, and with Carolina and Ariana no longer a threat, the path forward seemed a little clearer.

As they stood together in the quiet of their home, the news broke on television. The media reported on the arrest of Carolina and Ariana,with footage of the dramatic confrontation playing out on every channel. But more importantly, the reporters revealed that no one had been found in the burning car from earlier that day, confirming that Lily had never been in danger.


Alexander squeezed Lily's hand as they watched the broadcast. He was glad that the truth was out, and that Lily had successfully outsmarted their enemies. Yet, even as they took a moment to celebrate, they knew that other challenges lay ahead.

The next morning, a new threat emerged. As Alexander and Lily discussed their next steps, a letter was delivered to their door, sealed with a wax emblem they both recognized-the mark of one of Carolina's former allies.The note inside was simple but menacing: *"Carolina may be gone, but her debts are not forgotten. The fight has just begun."*


Lily exchanged a look with Alexander, her expression hardening once again.“It seems we have a new enemy. But this time, we'll be ready."

Alexander nodded, his resolve firm. “Together, we'll face whatever comes next. They have no idea what they're up against."

As they prepared for the new challenges ahead, Lily andI Alexander knew that they had survived one storm, but the clouds of another were already

###Chapter 166

As the sun set on a turbulent  Chapter. Lily and Alexander sat down in their living room, the weight of the past few days pressing down like a heavy blanket. The news of Carolina and Ariana's arrests had spread quickly, and whispers of the aftermath were already starting to ripple through the underground circles they had been dealing with. But for the moment, they allowed themselves a brief reprieve, trying to find some semblance of normalcy.

However. the ominous letter they'd received lingered in their minds, a constant reminder that their problems were far from over. Caleb, always the voice of wisdom, joined them at the dinner table, his eyes reflectinga seriousness that matched the tension in the air.

"Whoever sent that letter wants to scare you," Caleb said, breaking the silence. “But it's more than a threat-it's a challenge. They want to test how far you're willing to go."

Lily set her jaw, her determination unwavering. “Well, they'll find out soon enough that we don't scare easily. Carolina and Ariana thought they could corner us, and look where they ended up."

Caleb nodded approvingly, but Alexander couldn't shake his concern. “We need to know exactly who we're up against this time. Carolina's allies are powerful, and they might be more organized than we realize."

Caleb leaned back, considering Alexander's wvords.“We'll have to reach out to some old contacts, see if we can find out who's making moves. But you should be prepared for the possibility that this could get ugly.We're dealing with people who don't play by any rules."

Before they could discuss further, Alexander's phone buzzed on the table.
It was a private message from a trusted contact, someone who owed Alexander a favor. As he read the message, his expression grew more serious. "It's worse than we thought." he muttered, catching Lily and Caleb's attention.


"What is it?" Lily asked, leaning closer to see the message.

Alexander sighed deeply, handing her the phone."There's been a series of strange meetings happening in the city. Carolina's allies are regrouping faster than we expected. It looks like they've appointed a new leader."

Lily read the message, her brow furrowing as she took in the details.“So they're not backing down. They want to pick up where Carolina left off."

Caleb looked thoughtful for a moment before speaking. “A new leader means a new strategy. We have to find out who this person is and what they're planning. If they're as ruthless as Carolina, we could be facing an even greater danger."


Just as Alexander was about to respond, a knock echoed through the hallway. Alexander and Lily exchanged a glance, and Caleb reached for the concealed weapon he kept in his jacket. Alexander approached the door cautiously, opening it just a crack.

Standing on the doorstep was a young man, barely out of his teens,wearing a worn-out hoodie. He looked nervously over his shoulder before speaking."I need to speak to you-it's about the people coming after you.Please, let me in. I don't have much time.”


Lily raised an eyebrow, scrutinizing the stranger. "Who are you,and why should we trust you?"


The young man's hands trembled as he held up a small flash drive."My
name is Jordan. I used to work for one of Carolina's allies. I have information-stuff that could help you. But if they find out I'm here, I'm as good as dead."


Alexander weighed his options for a moment before stepping back to let him in. Jordan hurried inside, his eyes darting around the room.“You're making a big risk< coming here," Alexander warned him. “You better have something worth our time.”


Jordan nodded quickly, handing over the flash drive.“They've been planning something big-something that involves a lot more than just revenge against you. It's all on here. Just... please, help me get out of this.
I don't want to end up like Carolina."

Lily took the flash drive, sliding it into a nearby laptop. As the files loaded,Alexander watched Jordan carefully, trying to gauge whether he could be trusted. But the urgency in the young man's eyes seemed genuine.

The screen flickered to life, revealing a series of documents, surveillance footage, and encrypted messages. Lily's expression darkened as she scanned through the files. “They're not just targeting us," she whispered.“They're planning to take control of the entire network Carolina left behind.They want power, not just revenge.”

Caleb leaned over her shoulder, reading the files with a frown. "If this is true, we're dealing with a full-scale takeover. They want to seize everything Carolina once controlled-her businesses, her contacts,everything."

Alexander exhaled sharply. "We need to strike first. If they gain control of those resourees, they'll have enough power to crush anyone who stands in their way-including us.”
Lily nodded, her mind already racing with plans. "Then we need to use this information to get ahead of them. If we can dismantle their plans before they can regroup. we might have a chance."

Jordan watched them, fear still etched across his face. "Please, I did what you asked. You said you'd protect me."


Alexander met his gaze, nodding firmly. “You did the right thing, Jordan.We'll make sure you're safe. But you need to tell us everything you know about their new leader. We have to find out who's pulling the strings before it's too late."


As Jordan began to speak, the atmosphere in the room grew tense,the weight of their next steps pressing down on all of them. They had escaped Carolina's shadow. but a new storm was brewing on the horizon, one that could engulf everything they had fought to protect. With Lily, Alexander,and Caleb ready to face whatever came next, they knew that this battle would be unlike any other-and they were determined not to lose.
###Chapter 167

As Jordan shared what he knew, the gravity of the situation became clearer.He recounted how Carolina's allies, now leaderless, had quickly rallied around a new figure-someone far more elusive and cunning than Carolina. This new leader, only referred to as "The Architect" in the encrypted files, had already started reorganizing Carolina's operations and expanding into new territories. It seemed like he was determined to control the entire network and use its resources to push an even larger agenda.


Jordan's voice trembled as he spoke. “The Architect doesn't care about you specifically, not like Carolina did. He wants to rebuild everything she lost and make it bigger. He's looking for power on a scale that Carolina never dreamed of."


Lily's eyes narrowed as she listened. “But he sees us as a threat to his plans," she muttered. "That's why he's still targeting us."

Alexander crossed his arms, his expression unreadable.“What do you know about his identity? Have you seen his face?”

Jordan shook his head. “No one has. He communicates through intermediaries and encrypted messages. The closest anyone gets to meeting him is through his right-hand man-someone they ca11 'The Whisperer.'He's the one who handles the dirty work."

Caleb, who had been silent, finally spoke up. "If this Whisperer is the closest link to The Architect, then that's who we should go after. Cut off the right hand, and we might force The Architect out into the open."

Alexander nodded in agreement, but Lily had a different thought. "We'll need more than that. If The Architect is as careful as he seems, he won't
show his face just because we take out one of his men. We need to find out what he's planning and use it against him."

She turned back to Jordan. “What else do you have? Any leads on where they're operating from, any vulnerabilities?"


Jordan hesitated, glancing nervously between them. "I... I might know of one place. It's an old warehouse, a front for one of their safehouses.I think The Whisperer operates from there sometimes, but it's heavily guarded. If you're planning on going there, you'll need backup."

Alexander exchanged a look with Lily. “We'll need to move quickly,"he said."The longer we wait, the more time they have to solidify their control.



Juast as they were about to finalize their plan, a call came through on Lily's phone. It was from one of their inside sources, someone they had placed within the police department to keep them informed. Lily answered,and the voice on the other end spoke with urgency.


“Lily,you won't believe this. The media just released an update-no one was found inside the car that burned. They're saying it's a mystery who survived. But Alexander should know by now that you weren't in that car.”


Relief washed over Lily's face. “Thank you for letting me know," she replied before hanging up. She turned to Alexande, a small smile tugging at her lips. "Alexander, the truth is out. They know I wasn't in that car."

Alexander exhaled, a weight lifting from his shoulders. "That's good news.But it also means that The Architect might know that too. We need to use this to our advantage."
Caleb listened intently, a thoughtful look in his eyes. "We have an opportunity here. The Architect might think he has the upper hand, but he doesn't know we've got someone on the inside. Let's make him think he's still in control while we set the trap."

As they continued to strategize, a new tension filled the room-one of anticipation. The path ahead was dangerous, but they knew that they were no longer on the defensive. They had a chance to take the fight to their enemy and finally put an end to the shadowy threat that loomed over them.


Meanwhile, in another part of town, Carolina was sitting in her cell, her mind racing with anger and frustration. She had heard the news about Ariana's fate and the fact that Lily had slipped through their fingers yet again. Her grip tightened on the bars, her eyes filled with fury. She blamed Lily for everything, convinced that her former ally had become her greatest adversary.


“I'll find a way out of here,” Carolina muttered under her breath.“And when I do, I'll make sure Lily pays for what she's done.”

But little did she know, her enemies were already moving against her allies,tightening the noose around the very power structure she had once relied on. And in the shadows, The Architect watched, waiting for the moment to reveal his true intentions. For him, this was more than a battle for control-it was a game, and every player on the board was just another piece to be manipulated.


As Alexander, Lily, Caleb, and Jordan prepared for the next phase of their mission, the stakes grew higher, and the lines between allies and enemies blurred. What none of them realized was that a hidden player was about to make their move, setting the stage for a confrontation that would
change everything they thought they knew.
###Chapter 168

In a dimly lit office, surrounded by stacks of papers and a wall full of maps, a figure sat in silence, illuminated only by the glow of a computer screen. The Architect was going through the latest reports from his operatives. His fingers tapped rhythmically on the desk as he read through the data on Lily, Alexander, and their recent moves. The screen showed security footage of their meeting with Jordan, captured from a distant camera.


“Predictable,” he murmured, his voice barely a whisper in the empty room."They think they're closing in, but they have no idea how deep this goes.”

The door behind him creaked open, and a shadowy figure entered-the Whisperer, his most trusted lieutenant. Dressed in a dark suit, the Whisperer moved quietly, almost blending into the darkness of the room.

"They've discovered the safehouse, sir," the Whisperer said, his voice calm but serious. “They're planning to strike soon.”

The Architect turned to face him, a faint smirk playing on his lips.“Let them. It will give them a false sense of victory. But make sure the real operations are moved before they arrive. Leave just enough behind to make it look like a legitimate target."


The Whisperer nodded. "Understood. And what about Carolina? She's becoming a liability in her current state."

The Architect leaned back in his chair, considering the question. “She's of no further use to me. But her anger could still serve as a distraction. Let her plot her revenge. It will keep their attention divided while we proceed with the real plan.”
The Whisperer's expression remained unreadable, but he understood the intent. Carolina's rage might draw Lily and Alexander's focus away,giving The Architect the time he needed to set his larger scheme into motion.

"Make sure to leak some information about her intentions to our friends in law enforcement,” the Architect continued. “Let them think they're catching a big break. It should keep them busy for a while."

The Whisperer nodded once more before turning to leave, disappearing back into the shadows. The Architect returned to his computer screen,where maps of the city and a series of encrypted communications flickered.
He knew that Alexander, Lily, and their allies were resourceful, but he had a larger game in mind-one that went beyond the simple power struggles of the past.


Meanwhile,across town. Alexander, Lily, Caleb, and Jordan gathered in an abandoned warehouse that served as a temporary command center. The walls were covered with photos, maps, and notes about The Architect's known associates and operations. A makeshift table in the center held blueprints of the safehouse they were planning to raid.


Lily glanced at Alexander, concern in her eyes. “I don't like this,Alexander. It feels too easy. If this is one of The Architect's key locations,why would he leave it unguarded?"

Alexander nodded, sharing her unease. “I've been thinking the same thing.But we don't have a choice. If we wait too long, he'll slip through our fingers again."

Caleb, standing by the door, spoke up. "We need to be ready for anything.He might expect us to take the bait, but that doesn't mean we should walk into a trap blindly.”
Jordan, scanning through his own set of documents, looked up. “There's something else. While we've been focused on The Architect's moves,I've been keeping an eye on Carolina. I think she's planning to escape custody.She's been in contact with a few of her old allies through a corrupt guard."

Alexander frowned."That's the last thing we need-Carolina back in play.If she gets out, she'll come after Lily and anyone she thinks is standing in her way.”


Lily, however, saw an opportunity. “Maybe we can use it to our advantage.If she escapes, she'll want to come after us directly. Wecould set a trap for her, make her think she has the upper hand."


Caleb looked skeptical. “It's a risky play, Lily. You know she won't hesitate to use whatever means she has left."

Lily met his gaze with determination. “I know. But if it helps us bring down The Architect and his operations, it's worth the risk. We can't let any loose ends remain, especially if they can be turned into opportunities."

Alexander placed a hand on her shoulder, his expression a mix of worry and admiration. “Just promise me you'll be careful. We're in this together.but I don't want to lose you to a reckless plan."

Lily squeezed his hand in response. “We'll be smart about this. We've come too far to let things fall apart now."

As they finalized their plans, Jordan shared the latest intelligence on the safehouse, detailing escape routes and possible traps. They knew that the next few days would be critical, with everything riding on their ability to outsmart both Carolina and The Architect.

Elsewhere, Carolina was already putting her own plan into motion. She
had slipped a small device to the corrupt guard, a tool that would disable the cameras in her cell for a short time. All she needed was a few minutes,and she would be out. Fueled by a mix of anger and desperation,she believed that her freedom was the key to regaining her lost power-and exacting her revenge on Lily, whom she now saw as the cause of her downfall.


As the different threads of their plans began to intertwine, the city itself seemed to hold its breath, anticipating the clash that was coming. And in the shadows, The Architect watched, knowing that the game was about to enter its most dangerous phase yet. But even he couldn't foresee all the surprises that lay ahead, nor the alliances that might shift when the stakes were at their highest.


It was only a matter of time before everything came to a head-where victory, betrayal, and survival would be decided in a final, unpredictable confrontation.
###Chapter 169

As the tension in the city grew, so did the anticipation for the various players involved. Carolina's escape plan moved forward, with the corrupt guard disabling the security cameras in her wing of the detention facility.Her hands trembled slightly as she hid the small lockpick device he had smuggled to her under the table. It had been years since she had needed to rely on such crude tools, but desperation sharpened her focus. The guard slipped her a knowing nod as he passed by during the evening rounds, signaling that everything was in place.

In the dead of night, when the hallways were dark and empty, Carolina made her move. With quick, precise motions, she manipulated the lock and pushed the cell door open just enough to slip through. Every sound seemed magnified-the faint buzz of the overhead lights, the distant footsteps of guards on other floors. She moved quietly through the hallways,sticking to the shadows until she reached a side exit the guard had left unlocked for her.


The cold night air hit her face as she stepped outside, free for the first time in months. A black sedan waited for her at the edge of the facility's grounds, headlights off. As she slid into the back seat, she looked up to see an old ally behind the wheel-a mercenary who owed her favors from a long-forgotten conflict. He glanced back at her, the corners of his mouth twitching into a smirk.

"Thought you'd never get out of that place, Carolina.”

She settled into the seat, catching her breath. "I'm out now, and I need to find Lly. She's the one who got me in there, and she'll pay for it.”

The car pulled away from the facility, disappearing into the city's
nightscape. As they sped away, Carolina thought of the twisted satisfaction she would feel facing Lily and making her pay for every perceived betrayal.She had no idea, however, that Lily and Alexander were already anticipating her escape.

Back at their makeshift command center, Lily and Alexander received a message from one of their informants within the detention facility. As soon as the text came through, Lily's phone buzzed, and she glanced at the screen.

"She's out," Lily said, turning to Alexander and Caleb, who had gathered around the table.


Alexander nodded, already reaching for a map of potential hideouts Carolina might use. "She'll be coming for you, Lily. And if she's desperate enough,she won't care about collateral damage."

Caleb,standing with arms crossed, studied the map. "We should keep her close, but not too close. We can use her to draw out some of The Architect's operatives-if she thinks she's got the upper hand, she'll become reckless.”


Lily thought for a moment, then agreed. “Let's leak some false information through her old channels. Make her believe she's found a secret meeting spot where I'm supposed to be alone. If she falls for it, we'll have her right where we want her.”


As they set their trap, The Architect watched from a distance,receiving updates from his own sources. A new plan was already forming in his mind, one that would use Carolina's hatred to his advantage. If he could steer her towards Lily and Alexander while keeping his own operatives in the shadows, he could create enough chaos to keep them occupied.His real objective, however, was something entirely different-something that
would unfold far away from the attention of Lily and her allies.


***


Meanwhile, in a remote location on the outskirts of the city,a team of construction workers, unknowingly part of The Architect's scheme, had been working on an underground facility for weeks. What appeared to be a simple expansion project for a new subway line was, in fact, something much more secretive. The Architect had spent months orchestrating this plan, bribing city officials and planting false blueprints to keep the true nature of the project hidden. This underground space was intended as a staging area-a safe place where he could relocate his operations when the time came.

His goal was simple: to build a hidden network under the city, providing not only a new base of operations but also a way to move around without being detected. And once complete, it would give him the power to strike at his enemies while remaining untouchable.

As the workers continued drilling through the earth, unaware of what they were truly building, The Architect's mind turned to the next phase. If he could manipulate Carolina's anger and Lily's determination to weaken each other, he would have a clear path to complete his underground network-and the power it would bring.


Back in the city, the false meeting spot had been arranged, a quiet park on the outskirts where Lily was meant to meet Carolina. The sun had just begun to set, casting long shadows across the deserted playground. Lily.hidden behind a row of trees with Alexander, kept a watchful eye on the scene,waiting for Carolina's arrival.

"She's late," Alexander muttered, his eyes scanning theempty park.“What if she caught on?”
Lily shook her head. “No, she's too angry to think clearly. She'll come.”

And she was right. A few minutes later, the black sedan approached the park, and Carolina stepped out, a pistol hidden beneath her coat. She moved cautiously, scanning the area for any signs of a trap. But instead of Lily,she found herself face to face with Caleb, standing alone in the center of the clearing.

“Looking for someone?" he called out, his tone deceptively casual.

Carolina's eyes narrowed as she pulled out the gun, aiming it at Caleb.“Where is she?”

Before she could get an answer, a noise behind her made her spin around,only to find herself surrounded by Alexander and a team of Lily's operatives. They had expected her to come armed and ready for a fight,and now she was cornered.


But Carolina had one more trick up her sleeve. With a swift motion, she pressed a button on a small device she had hidden in her coat. A loud explosion rocked the park as the black sedan behind her went up in flames,creating a temporary diversion. In the confusion, Carolina broke into a sprint, disappearing into the trees.

Alexander cursed under his breath as he tried to chase after her, but the smoke and flames slowed him down.“She's getting away!"

Lily grabbed his arm, pulling him back. “Let her go, Alexander. She's leading us into another trap. We'll deal with her later."

They watched as Carolina's figure vanished into the darkness, but Lily knew this battle was far from over. She glanced at Alexander,determination burning in her eyes. "We need to find The Architect's real
base before he finishes whatever he's planning underground. He's using her to buy time.”

Alexander nodded, his jaw set. "And we can't afford towaste any more time ourselves."


As they regrouped, the distant sounds of sirens grew louder,signaling the arrival of emergency services to the scene of the explosion. It was a reminder that their time was running out, and that the web of deceit and danger woven by The Architect, Carolina, and their own quest for justice was growing tighter with each passing moment.
###Chapter 170

The aftermath of Carolina's narrow escape left a lingering tension among Lily,Alexander, and Caleb as they regrouped at their safe house. They knew Carolina would not remain in hiding for long-her vendetta against Lily was too strong. But with The Architect moving in the shadows, they couldn't afford to focus solely on Carolina. They needed to split their efforts, track down The Architect's growing underground network, and anticipate his next move.



Miles away, beneath the city, The Architectoversaw the final stages of his underground facility's construction. The hidden chamber was nearly complete-a large, reinforced room that would serve as a command center,allowing him to direct his operations out of sight. He looked over the blueprints one last time, pleased with the progress. His plans for the city ran deeper than anyone knew.

The facility wasn't just a hideout. It was designed with a series of tunnels that would connect to key points throughout the city-places where he could stage operations, move personnel, or even deploy explosives if it came to that. He had foreseen that Alexander and Lily would be focused on Carolina, and he used that time to build this secret network right under their feet. Now, it was almost ready.

One of his most trusted operatives, a man known only as Shadow,approached with a report. "The underground routes are operational, sir.But there's something you should know-Lily and Alexander are getting closer to discovering this project. They've been asking questions in the construction sector,bribing contractors.”
The Architect considered this, his expression calm but calculating.“Good.Let them dig deeper. I want them to think they're on the verge of a breakthrough. When they get close enough, we'll lead them straight into a trap.”


Shadow nodded and disappeared into the dark tunnels, leaving The Architect to plan the next phase. He picked up a small device on his desk,looking at a map of the city with several red dots-potential targets he could use as leverage if the situation called for it. He couldn't help but smile, knowing he had the upper hand for now.



***


Meanwhile, at a small café downtown, Lily met with an unexpected ally-an old friend of Alexander's named Victor. He was a former police detective who had retired early after being disillusioned with the corruption in the city's law enforcement. They had reached out to him,hoping his experience with the city's underworld could provide them with insights into The Architect's operations.


Victor sipped his coffee thoughtfully as Lily laid out what they knew. “This guy is thorough, I'll give him that. The police haven't been able to trace a single lead back to him directly. But if he's building something underground, there's got to be a way to track it-construction permits,materials, transport routes. He can't hide everything."


Lily nodded, appreciating his perspective. “We've been digging into those,but he's covered his tracks well. He's got a lot of city officials in his pocket.and any time we get close to a lead,it disappears."


Victor leaned in, lowering his voice. "There might be one other way.I know a guy who worked on some off-the-books construction projects. He's kept his head down since getting out, but he might be willing to talk if he
thinks it could clear his record."

"Do you think he'd be willing to point us in the right direction?" Lily asked, sensing a glimmer of hope.

Victor shrugged. "For the right price, maybe. I'll set upa meeting,but we have to be careful. If The Architect catches wind of this, he'll make sure that guy disappears before we even get a word out of him."

As Lily and Victor discussed their next move. Alexander received a call from one of their tech experts. The man's voice was filled with urgency."Alexander, I've been monitoring city communications like you asked. I just picked up on something strange-rumors about a meeting between a high-ranking official and someone who matches The Architect's description.They're planning to meet tomorrow night at the old warehouse near the docks.”


Alexander's eyes narrowed. “Do you think it's a trap?"

“Most likely. But if we're prepared, it could be our chance to finally put a face to The Architect's name."


Alexander considered this, knowing it could be the breakthrough they needed-or a disaster waiting to happen. He turned to Lily as she finished her conversation with Victor."We might have a lead on The Architect. But it's risky. He could be setting a trap for us."

Lily's expression hardened. “Then we'll have to turn the trap back on him.We can't keep letting him control the board."

***

Elsewhere, Carolina had taken refuge in an old safe house in a rundown part of town, using burner phones to contact the remnants of her network.
But she quickly realized she wasn't as hidden as she thought.Her old allies were reluctant to help her, and whispers reached her ears that Lily and Alexander were closing in, more determined than ever to shut down anyone who sided with The Architect.

Frustration boiled within her, but as she brooded over her next move,a call came through from an anonymous number. The voice on the other end was calm and familiar-the unmistakable tone of The Architect himself.


“I hear you've had a rough time, Carolina. Perhaps it's time we discuss how you can be of use to me again," he said, his words smooth as silk.

Carolina clenched her jaw, but she knew she had little choice. “What do you want from me?”

"I need you to be a distraction. Lily and Alexander have been sniffing around too close to my operations. I'll provide you with the resources to keep them occupied. In return, you'll get your chance at revenge."

She paused,weighing her options, but eventually agreed. “Fine. But if you double-cross me, I'll make sure you pay for it,Architect."

“Oh, I wouldn't dream of it,” he replied, a hint of amusement in his voice.



***


Back at their safe house, Caleb pulled Alexander aside. “I've been thinking about something. What if we're being too reactive? We need to take the fight to The Architect's doorstep, but we can't let Carolina run loose either.



Alexander nodded. “You're right. We need to split our focus-one team to track down The Architect and disrupt his operations, and another to
finally take Carolina out of play."

Lily joined them, determination in her eyes. "And I know just the person who can help us track her-Maxwell. He's been quiet since the last encounter, but he's still got the resources to find her. It's time we bring him back into the fold."

Alexander. Lily, and Caleb spent the rest of the night coordinating their next moves, knowing that each decision could shift the balance of power.As they prepared for what was to come, the shadows of the city seemed to deepen, filled with secrets waiting to be unearthed. And in the darkness,The Architect and his allies watched, waiting for the right moment to strike back.
###Chapter 171

The next evening, a heavy rain poured over the city, casting a gray haze that blurred the skyline. Alexander, Lily, and Caleb sat inside a black SUV parked at a distance from the old warehouse near the docks. Their contact had been right; there was activity, subtle but clear to a trained eye. Cars with darkened windows arrived in staggered intervals, their occupants slipping into the shadows of the warehouse.

Inside. Alexander studied a set of surveillance images, each showing different angles of the warehouse perimeter. Lily, ever resourceful,tapped into the feed from a nearby security camera, which gave them a closer look at the figures entering. Among them, a ta11, slender man in a gray suit stood out-his face partially obscured by a hat. It matched The Architect's description perfectly.

Caleb,observing from the backseat, frowned. “This is too easy. He's letting us see him. It's a setup."


“I know," Alexander replied, adjusting his earpiece. “But if he's here in person, he's confident. It means he thinks he has the upper hand. We need to use that against him."


Lily looked at her husband, her expression stern. “Then let's give him a surprise he won't forget. I've called in Maxwell and a few of his trusted men-they're stationed a few blocks away, ready to move in on my signal."

Alexander nodded.“Alright. Caleb, you stay here and monitor the feeds.Lily and I will head inside, but we do this quietly. If we can get close enough, maybe we can turn this trap around."

As they moved out into the rainy night, slipping through the shadows towards the warehouse, a sense of tension hung in the air. Inside, the
sound of their footsteps was drowned out by the rain and the hum of the city's docks. The warehouse was filled with old shipping crates, stacks of pallets, and rusted machinery that provided plenty of cover. They moved silently,creeping closer to the center of the warehouse where The Architect and his men seemed to gather.

But as they drew nearer, Lily spotted something that made her heart skip a beat. Hidden behind one of the crates was Carolina, her face twisted in barely-contained fury. She was armed, watching The Architect's meeting unfold from a distance. Clearly, she had her own plans, and they likely involved a bullet aimed at The Architect's head.

Lily whispered to Alexander, “Carolina's here. Looks like she's ready to settle her own score."


Alexander glanced in her direction, and a grim smile crossed his face. “Let's use that. If she makes a move on him, it might create enough chaos for us to slip in and capture them both."

As they watched, Carolina took a deep breath and raised her pistol, taking aim at The Architect. But just before she pulled the trigger, a sudden clatter echoed through the warehouse. It was Maxwell and his team,moving in to secure the exits. The sound distracted Carolina, and she hesitated,glancing around to see the new arrivals.

The Architect, sensing the disturbance, turned sharply in her direction and gave a small, mocking smile. “Carolina, dear, I knew you couldn't resist coming. You never did know how to stay hidden."

Carolina cursed under her breath, realizing she'd lost the element of surprise. She fired off a shot anyway, but The Architect's bodyguards were quick to intervene, pulling him out of the line of fire. Bullets flew as chaos erupted in the warehouse, and Alexander and Lily seized the moment,
moving quickly through the confusion to flank The Architect.

Maxwell's men stormed in, adding to the firefight as they exchanged gunfire with The Architect's guards. Amid the chaos, Carolina was pinned down, but she kept her focus, trying to get another shot at her target. Lily,however,had different plans.

With swift precision, she moved toward Carolina's position,her gun raised.
“Drop the weapon, Carolina! It's over. You're coming with us."

Carolina's eyes blazed with fury as she turned to face Lily, her grip tightening on her pistol. “You think you've won, Lily? You have no idea what he's planning. If you take me out, you're only making him stronger."

Lily kept her aim steady, even as gunfire crackled around them.“That's a risk I'm willing to take. But if you surrender now, maybe we can protect you from him."


Carolina hesitated, her mind racing. She could see The Architect slipping away through the shadows, his smile taunting her as he disappeared into a side passage. She lowered her gun just a fraction, but before she could make a decision, one of The Architect's guards managed to shoot the weapon out of her hand, sending it clattering to the floor.

Lily moved in quickly, wrestling Carolina to the ground and restraining her.“You're done, Carolina. This time, you're going to pay for everything."

Carolina spat back, her voice filled with bitterness. “You're making a mistake, Lily. He'll come after youI next. You and Alexander both."
As the commotion in the warehouse died down and Maxwell's men secured the remalning guards. Alexander went after The Architect,following the faint footsteps that led into the darkened passage. He found himself in a maze of corridors beneath the warehouse, each one twisting into the next. Just when he thought he had lost the trail, a shadowvy figure stepped out from behind a corner, clapping slowly.

“Impressive, Alexander. You've come so far," The Architect said,his voice echoing in the damp, concrete corridor. “But did you really think you could catch me this easily?"

Alexander kept his gun trained on him. “You're not getting away this time.Surrender, and maybe I'll convince the courts to show some leniency.”

The Architect chuckled softly, his eyes glinting with a dark amusement.“Oh, I'm afraid you've got it all wrong. This isn't the endgame-it's just the beginning. While you were busy here, my network has already set the next phase in motion. Enjoy the little victory, Alexander. It won't last."

With a sudden movement, The Architect dropped a small device on the ground, releasing a blinding flash that filled the corridor with searing white light. By the time Alexander's vision cleared, he found himself alone in the passageway, the faint sound of footsteps fading into the distance.

Cursing under his breath, he radioed back to Lily. “He's gone, but we have Carolina. How's it looking up there?"

Lily's voice came through, steady but tense. "We've got the warehouse secured. Carolina's in custody. But he's still one step ahead."

Alexander rejoined them at the main floor, where Carolina was being led out in restraints, her face a mask of anger and defeat. As she passed Lily,she leaned in, whispering just loud enough for her to hear. “You'll regret
this. When he makes his next move, you'll wish you had me on your side."Lily said nothing, watching as Carolina was escorted into a waiting vehicle.But as the door slammed shut, she couldn't shake the feeling that Carolina's warning held more truth than she wanted to admit.

***


Meanwhile, in the depths of his new underground lair, The Architect stood before a large, holographic map of the city, a satisfied smile on his face. He pressed a button on his desk, and new red dots appeared across the map.each one representing a key target. His plans were far from over, and now he knew exactly where to strike next.

The Architect's eyes gleamed with anticipation.“Let the real game begin."
###Chapter 172

As Carolina was driven away into custody,the rain continued to pour down, adding a rhythmic patter to the tense atmosphere outside the warehouse. Alexander, Lily, and Maxwell regrouped near the SUV,each soaked through, but their expressions remained focused. There was a small sense of victory, but it was overshadowed by the escape of The Architect and his cryptic words.

Maxwell leaned against the car, shaking water off his coat."We might have Carolina, but The Architect slipped through our fingers again. What do we do now?"


Alexander ran a hand through his wet hair, looking back at the shadowed warehouse."We regroup,follow the leads, and find out what his next move is. He's playing a long game, but he made a mistake tonight by showing himself."

Lily's eyes darted to the darkened alleyways around them, a hint of worry in her voice."He said this was only the beginning. Whatever he's planning,it's bigger than just Carolina. And he's more confident than ever."

Caleb's voice crackled through the earpiece, cutting into their conversation.“You're right to be concerned, Lily. I've been monitoring police chatter.There's a new alert going out-unexplained power failures across key city grids, including some connected to high-security systems. He's already starting the next phase."

Alexander's jaw clenched. "We need to find out what he's targeting. If he's hitting power grids, he could bé planning a major blackout to cover up something bigger,”

Maxwell nodded, the rain running down his face. "I'll reach out to my
contacts at the power company and see what I can dig up. If he's targeting infrastructure, we might be able to predict his next move."

Lily added,"And I'll dig through the data we've gathered so far,see if there's a pattern we missed. He has to leave a trail somewhere, no matter how good he thinks he is."

Alexander glanced at Lily, feeling a surge of appreciation for her determination. Despite everything they'd faced, she remained unyielding,always by his side. He reached out, taking her hand for a brief moment.“We'll get through this, together.”

Lily squeezed his hand back. “Always.”

As they prepared to leave the warehouse area, a sleek, black car pulled up,and an unexpected figure stepped out-Carolina's lawyer, a sharp-looking woman with a no-nonsense demeanor. She approached them,barely flinching at the rain.

She looked directly at Alexander and Lily, her expression unreadable. “My client has instructed me to deliver a message. Carolina believes that you'll need her heIp sooner than you think. She's willing to trade information for a deal."


Alexander narrowed his eyes. “She's bluffing. She'll say anything to get out of facing justice."


The lawyer's smirk hinted at some hidden knowledge. "She told me you'd say that. But she also mentioned a specifie account in a Swiss bank-one that might have ties to your investigation. She's offering proof, in exchange for leniency.”


Lily's expression faltered, a glimmer of uncertainty crossing her face.“Why
would she give us this now?"

The lawyer shrugged. "Desperation makes strange bedfellows. Think about it. She's at the central precinct. I'd advise against taking too long."

With that, the lawyer returned to her car and drove off, leaving Alexander and Lily to contemplate the new offer. Alexander felt his mind racing with possibilities. Could Carolina be using this as a ploy to manipulate them?Or did she genuinely have a piece of the puzzle that could help them get ahead of The Architect?


***

Meanwhile, at a hidden location on the outskirts of the city, The Architect stood in a dimly lit room, surrounded boy banks of monitors and a dozen henchmen working at various stations. He observed the city grid flashing on one screen, showing the areas that were slowly losing power, one by one.


“Excellent,” he murmured, turning to one of his operatives. “Theblackout will leave the city vulnerable. It's time to move forward with the next phase. Prepare our operatives for infiltration."


The operative nodded, his face grim. “What about Carolina? She's been captured.”


The Architect waved a hand dismissively. "She was always a pawn. Her role is over. Now, the real players step into the game."

He walked over to another monitor, displaying live feeds from various points across thecity. As he watched, a particular feed caught his eye-one showing the central precinct where Carolina was being held. He leaned closer, his smile widening as he noticed a familiar figure leaving the
building: Alexander, accompanied by Lily. The sight of them stirred something in him-a mix of admiration and disdain.

“Ah, Alexander... you always were a challenge. But this time, you're playing in my world."

He switched to another screen, showing a live feed of a construction site on the outskirts of town-a place that most people thought had been abandoned for years. But beneath the surface, it housed something far more sinister, a hidden hub for his operations.

Turning back to his team, The Architect issued new orders. “Activate the sleeper agents in thecity. And send a message to our allies overseas. It's time to bring in additional resources. We're going to remind Alexander and his friends that no matter how far they think they've come, they're stiIl playing by my rules."



Back at the precinct, Alexander and Lily stood outside the interrogation room where Carolina waited, her hands cuffed to the table. As they watched her through the one-way mirror, Lily couldn't shake theuneasy feeling that lingered in her chest.


Alexander turned to her, his voice low. “You don't have to be in there with me. This might get messy."

Lily shook her head, determination hardening her features. “We're doing this together, remember? Let's hear what she has to say. If she's lying, we'Il know."


They entered the room, and Carolina looked up, a sly smile curling her lips. "Well, well. I knew you couldn't resist. How about we cut to the
chase? I have inaformation on The Architect's next move-something you can't afford to ignore.”

Alexander folded his arms, leaning forward. “Start talking, and it better be worth our time."

Carolina's eyes glinted with a dangerous mix of triumph and defiance.“He's using the blackout to cover his tracks, but that's not all. There's a hidden facility beneath the old construction site off the eastern highway. It's his base of operations. But there's something else, something even he doesn't know I'm aware of."

She leaned in closer, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.“There's a traitor among you. Someone feeding him information,keeping him one step ahead."

Lily's blood ran cold, and she exchanged a look with Alexander. A traitor?It could explain how The Architect always seemed to stay ahead of them.But who could it be?


Alexander clenched his fists, trying to maintain control. “Give us a name,Carolina. If you're lying-”

"I'm not lying,” she interrupted, her tone turning serious. “But I'll only give you the name once I'm outof here. Consider it insurance."

Alexander's jaw tightened. “We'll see about that. For now, you're staying right where you are."

Carolina's smile returned, but there was a new edge to it, a confidence that hinted she still had cards left to play. "You can try to shut me out.Alexander, but you'll come back. You'll need me more than you realize."

As they left the room, the weight of her words lingered in the air between
them. The thought of a traitor among their ranks changed everything.casting new shadows over their every move. And somewhere out there.The Architect continued to orchestrate his grand game,knowing he had sown enough seeds of doubt to keep them guessing.
###Chapter 173

As Alexander and Lily exited the precinct, the air between them was thick with tension. The rain had finally subsided, leaving the city streets glistening under the lamplights. Lily stole a glance at Alexander, her mind swirling with Carolina's revelation.

"We need to start looking into our own team." Lily said quietly, her voice barely a whisper. "If she's telling the truth, and there's a mole among us...



Alexander nodded, his face grim. “It means every plan we've made,every move we've taken, has potentially been compromised.”

They got into their car, and as the engine hummed to life, Lily's phone buzzed with an alert. It was the latest update from the news outlets. She swiped through, her expression shifting as she read the headline:*Mysterious Car Crash Revealed No Occupants-New Questions Arise as Authorities Investigate*.

She held up the screen for Alexander to see. “The media's picked up on it.They've confirmed that no one was in the vehicle when it exploded.The Architect's plan to make it look like you lost me has failed.”

Alexander let out a slow breath, relief flooding through him.“He's going to be furious. This throws a wrench in whatever he's planned next. But it means he'll push harder-he's unpredictable when he's cornered."

Lily's eyes narrowed as she scrolled further. "There's more. They're reporting unusual movements near the old construction site. The same one Carolina mentioned. If that's where his hidden facility is, we might have a shot at ending this,"
Alexander's mind churned, piecing together the fragments of their intel.“We can't go in blind. We'll need Maxwell and Caleb to coordinate with the police for backup. And... if Carolina's telling the truth, we'll have to be ready for any surprises from inside our own circle."

Lily hesitated before speaking, the weight of her next words evident.“And what if it's one of them? What if Maxwell, or even Caleb, is the one feeding him information?”

Alexander's face hardened, but hecouldn't ignore the possibility.“We'll have to be careful. But I've known Maxwell and Caleb for years-they're family. I won't accuse anyone without proof. But I also won't let this slide if it's true."



Meanwhile, at a secluded safe house across the city, The Architect sat in front of a bank of monitors, his expression tense as he watched the media coverage. His fingers drummed against the desk, a rare sign of frustration.

"They're figuring it out," he muttered to himself, before turning to one of his operatives, who stood nearby with a tense posture. “Send word to our remaining contacts. We need to expedite the timeline. And inform our mole-they need to ensure Alexander stays off our trail."

The operative nodded and left, but just as the door closed, another figure slipped through a side entrance-Ariana, looking battered but defiant. She had managed to escape her captors during the chaos of Carolina's arrest,making her way back to The Architect's hideout.

He glanced up at her, a thin smile crossing his lips. "You made it back.I expected nothing less."
Ariana's eyes flashed with anger. "Carolina's been captured,thanks to you!She was supposed to be protected."

The Architect's smile faded, and he regarded her coldly. "Carolina served her purpose. Her capture means nothing to our endgame. She's a distraction, and so is your emotional attachment to her."

Ariana bristled, but she knew better than to argue further. Instead, she shifted the conversation. “What's next? They'Il come for this facility soon.We can't just sit here.”


The Architect's gaze returned to the monitors. "No, we won't sit here.We're going to lure Alexander and his team into a trap. Let them think they have the upper hand, then take them down in one decisive move.”

He glanced back at Ariana, a dangerous gleam in his eyes. “And this time,you'll be playing a more direct role. Ready yourself, because when this ends, it will be on our terms.”

***

Back at the safe house where Lily and Alexander regrouped,Maxwell and Caleb arrived, their expressions as serious as the stormy night around them.Inside, the atmosphere crackled with urgency. Maxwell laid out a blueprint of the old construction site on the table, while Caleb spread out the latest intel reports,


Caleb's face was drawn with concern. “I don't like that Carolina knows so much about the site. It suggests we've missed something crucial.”

Maxwell nodded, his brow furrowed. "It could be a decoy, or worse-a trap. We'll need to be thorough and careful when we go in. If he's got a hidden base there, he'll have contingencies."
Alexander glanced at each of them, his suspicion carefully concealed.“We don't have a choice but to follow this lead. The Architect is getting bolder,and if we wait too long, he'll disappear again."

Lily, standing beside him, caught Caleb's eye. “And we need to be sure that there's no one working against us from the inside. I don't want any more surprises."


Caleb raised an eyebrow but remained calm. “You have my word, Lily. We're all in this together.”

Maxwell nodded firmly. “We won't let him divide us. Let's focus on the mission.”


Alexander studied their faces for a moment, then nodded.“All right. Let's prepare for the raid. But stay sharp-anything could happen."

***

As they moved out-toward the site, the tension between them was palpable.Each of them wondered about the possibility of a traitor in their midst.and who it could be. And in the shadows, The Architect's plans continued to unfold, with the city teetering on the edge of chaos.


Little did they know that while they were hunting for him, a new threat was brewing beneath their very feet-one that would change the game entirely.
###Chapter 174

As dawn broke, casting a pale light over the city, Alexander,Lily,Maxwell,and Caleb arrived at the old construction site. The place was desolate, its skeletal structures looming like forgotten giants. A chill hung in the air,mixing with the scent of wet concrete. They parked a distance away,hidden behind a cluster of trees, and began to assess the area.

Lily, clutching a pair of binoculars, scanned the site."It looks deserted, but we can't take any chances. The Architect is known for his traps."

Maxwell adjusted his earpiece, nodding toward a narrow entry point. “We should split up-cover more ground. Caleb and I will take the south side.You and Alexander can cover the northern perimeter."

Alexander agreed, but there was a lingering tension as the pairs split off into the early morning shadows. He caught a glimpse of Caleb's expression-a look he couldn't quite decipher. He filed it away in the back of his mind, knowing that doubt could mean the difference between life and death.


As they moved deeper into the abandoned site, Lily's phone buzzed. It was a text from one of their police contacts, sent directly to her encrypted line: *Tracking movement near your location. Be on alert.*

She showed the message to Alexander, and they exchanged a knowing look. They continued forward with increased caution, every step feeling like it could trigger a hidden trap.

Suddenly,the sound of footsteps echoed from the darkness. Alexander signaled to Lily to stay back as he moved forward, his hand on his weapon. He turned a corner, expecting to find one of The Architect's henchmen-but instead, he was face to face with Ariana.
Her eyes darted around, wild with fear, her clothes disheveled. “I didn't come to fight," she said quickly,her hands raised in surrender. "I'm alone.



Alexander didn't lower his weapon, keeping a wary eye on her.“Why should I believe you? Last time we met, you tried to kill us."

Ariana swallowed, glancing behind her as if expecting to be followed.“Things have changed. The Architect... he's planning something bigger than you realize. I tried to warn Carolina, but she wouldn't listen."

Lily stepped up beside Alexander, her expression skeptical.“You're saying you turned against him? Why?”

Ariana's face twisted with anger. “Because he betrayed me. He used my mother as a pawn and then abandoned her the moment she wasn't useful.And now he's planning to destroy anyone who gets in his way-even his own allies.”


Alexander shared a quick glance with Lily, unsure whether to trust Ariana's words. But before they could question her further, a loud explosion echoed across the site, shaking the ground beneath their feet.

"What was that?" Lily shouted, scanning the area frantically.

Ariana's face paled. "He's here. He knew you'd come. He set the charges to bring this whole place down.”




Meanwhile, on the south side of the site, Maxwell and Caleb were moving through the narrow hallways of an unfinished building. The air was thick with dust, and every creak of the metal beams set their nerves on edge.Caleb moved ahead, scanning the area with a flashlight, when a subtle
beeping sound caught his attention.

Maxwell followed the sound to a small, blinking device hidden beneath a stack of debris. His heart sank as he recognized it-another explosive.“Caleb, we need to move. He's rigged this place.”

But as he turned, he caught the flicker of something in Caleb's expression-a momentary hesitation. A chill ran down Maxwell's spine.“Caleb... why didn't you warn us?"

Caleb's face shifted, guilt mingling with resolve.“I had no choice, Maxwell.He has something on me-something that would ruin my family if it got out. I thought I could manage it, but I was wrong.'

Maxwell's grip tightened around his weapon, but he didn't raise it.“You've put us all in danger, Caleb. How could you?”

Before Caleb could respond, another explosion rocked the building,sending a cloud of debris crashing down between them. Maxwell stumbled back. barely avoiding a falling beam, and the two were separated by a wall of rubble.

Caleb's voice called out through the dust, sounding desperate. “I'm going to make this right, Maxwell! I swear it!"

Maxwell coughed1, trying to clear the dust from his lungs. "You'd better, or none of us are making it out of here alive."

***

Back on the north side, Alexander, Lily, and Ariana were running for cover as the explosions continued, sending metal and concrete raining down around them. They took refuge behind a large pillar, the structure barely holding against the shaking ground.
Ariana panted, her face streaked with dust. "He's going to blow this place to pieces and take us down with it. If you don't trust me,fine-but at least trust that I don't want to die today."

Alexander's mind raced as he weighed their options. He turned to Lily, his voice urgent. "We have to find Maxwell and Caleb. If wecan't disarm the explosives, we'll have to find a way out before the whole place comes down."


Lily nodded, buat she kept a wary eye on Ariana. “If you're lying, you won't make it out of here either."


Ariana met her gaze, a defiant spark in her eyes. “I'm not lying. But if you want to survive this, we need to work together-even if it's just this once.”


Alexander made a quick decision, handing Ariana a spare weapon.“Alright, let's move. But try anything, and I'll end this myself."

With the ground trembling beneath their feet, the three of them moved deeper into the crumbling site, the danger of The Architect's traps around every corner. As the explosions continued, a new question lingered in Alexander's mind-how deep did The Architect's network go, and how many of their allies were secretly working against them?

And back in the shadows, watching through hidden cameras, The Architect allowed himself a small, satisfied smile. The pieces on the board were finally moving the way he wanted. And the final phase of his plan was just beginning.
###Chapter 175

As the echoes of the explosions settled and a tense quiet fell over the construction site, Alexander, Lily, and Ariana moved through the maze of half-built structures, the air thick with dust. Every step felt like a gamble-one wrong move and the whole place could come down on them. But they pushed forward, knowing that time was running out.

Lily kept a close watch on Ariana as they moved, her distrust evident in the tight grip on her weapon. Ariana, sensing the tension, kept her hands visible and moved cautiously. “If you're planning to get us all out alive,I suggest you listen to me,"” she said, keeping her voice low. “There's an underground tunnel that leads to the back of the site. He doesn't know that I know about it."


Alexander shot her a skeptical look."And why should we believe you?You could be leading us into another trap."

Ariana stopped, turning to face him. Her eyes were wide with a desperate sincerity.“Because I want him gone as much as you do. And if you let this place bury me, you lose your only chance at stopping him."

Lily narrowed her eyes, studying Ariana's expression. After a tense moment, she gave a sharp nod. "We take the tunnel. But if you try anything-”

Ariana raised her hands agaín. “I get it. You don't trust me. But we don't have time for this. Follow me.”


***

Meanwhile,on the south side of the construction site, Maxwell was trying to dig through the rubble that separated him from Caleb. His hands were
bloody, his breaths coming in short gasps. He had to reach Caleb, to figure out how deep the betrayal ran-and to find out if there was any chance of salvaging their fragile alliance.

Through a narrow gap in the debris, he saw Caleb's shadowy figure struggling to disarm one of the explosives. Caleb's voice, muffled by the concrete, called out, “Maxwell, I'm trying to stop it! I swear!"

Maxwell paused, pressing his ear to the gap. “You better hope you can.Because if any of us make it out of here, you've got a lot of explaining to do.”


The tension between them hung like a thread, but the immediate danger took precedence. Maxwell resumed his efforts, trying to clear a path to Caleb. As he worked, he heard the familiar click of a disarmed device,and a sliver of hope sparked in hs chest. Maybe they had a chance after all.



Back on the northern side, Alexander, Lily, and Ariana reached a rusty door hidden behind a collapsed section of scaffolding. Ariana pulled at the handle, revealing a dark passage that led underground. “This way,"she whispered,stepping inside first. Alexander and Lily exchanged a wary look before following her down into the darkness.

The tunnel was narrow and smelled of damp earth. Their footsteps echoed as they descended, the sound amplifying the tension between them. Ariana led the way, moving with a certainty that suggested she had used this route before. As they reached a fork in the path, she hesitated for the first time,glaneing over her shoulder.

“It splits here. One path leads out, the other circles back under the main site. If we want to disable any more explosives, we take the left. If we just

Alexander weighed the options quickly. "We need to give Maxwell and Caleb more time. We go left."

Lily nodded in agreement, though her eyes remained on Ariana. “And you're coming with us. If this is a trick, you'll be the first to know how it ends.,


Ariana gave a tight, humorless smile. “Believe me, I've got no illusions about that."


***

Above ground, hidden among the trees on a nearby hill, The Architect watched the unfolding scene through a laptop connected to his network of hidden cameras. He zoomed in on Ariana's face as she led Alexander and Lily through the tunnels. His smile faded, replaced by a look of cold disappointment.

“So, you've turned against me, Ariana,” he muttered under his breath,his fingers drumming on the keyboard. He switched to another camera feed,watching Caleb struggle with the explosives. “And you, Caleb. I expected better.”


He tapped a few keys, accessing a hidden file on his computer. A blueprint of the construction site appeared, detailing the underground passages and the remaining explosives. With a grim smile, he activated a timer that began counting down-fifteen minutes until the remaining charges would detonate, collapsing the tunnels completely.

But as he prepared to set his final trap in motion, his phone buzzed with an incoming message. It was from an unknown number, the text brief and
ominous: *We know where you are.*

He froze, his gaze snapping to the window of his secluded hideout. A dlark SUV parked in the distance caught his attention, its engine running silently.He felt a chill run down his spine as he realized that the game might not be as firmly in his control as he thought.

***

Back in the tunnel, Alexander, Lily, and Ariana came upon a cache of explosives hidden behind a false wall. Ariana immediately crouched down,examining the devices with quick, precise movements. “These are connected to a remote trigger. He must be nearby-if we disable these, we'Il have a chance to flush him out."

Lily nodded, keeping watch while Alexander knelt beside Ariana.“Can you do it?" he asked.


Ariana glanced at him, a flicker of emotion crossing her face. “I don't have a choice, do I?" She began working on the wires, her hands moving swiftly.As she did, she whispered, just loud enough for Alexander to hear,“If we make it out of here, I'll tell you everything. About the leverage he has on Caleb, about the plan... even about what he's holding over me.”

Alexander nodded, keeping his focus on the dark tunnel around them."First. let's survive this."


Above them, the site continued to groan and creak as the structure weakened. But with Ariana's help, they managed to disarm the last of the explosives. As the timer on The Architect's device ran down to itsfinal seconds, the charges remained silent.

The Architect's eyes widened in disbelief as he watched his plans unravel.
And in that moment, the door behind him burst open, revealing a squad of tactical agents. The Architect reached for his gun, but it was too late-he was taken down in seconds, a look of fury on his face as he was restrained.


Back at the construction site, Ariana finally deactivated the last of the devices. She looked up at Alexander and Lily, letting out a long breath. “It's over. For now."


Lily, still skeptical, glanced between Ariana and Alexander.“Is it? Or is this just the beginning of another nightmare?”

Ariana's face hardened, and she met Lily's gaze. “That depends on what you do next. I'm not the one you should be worried about anymore."

But even as the words left her mouth, the three of them couldn't shake the feeling that a new threat was looming, one even more dangerous than The Architect. And as they emerged from the tunnel, the dawn breaking over the ruined site, they realized that thegame had only just shifted into a new, unpredictable phase.
###Chapter 176

With The Architect captured and his plans thwarted, there was a tense calm over the ruins of the construction site. But the truce between those involved was far from stable-old rivalries, unspoken alliances, and hidden secrets still bubbled beneath the surface. Alexander, Lily, and Ariana emerged from the chaos, each with a different agenda, each with a different understanding of what had just transpired.

Ariana glared at Alexander and Lily from a distance, her mind racing. She knew she had to act quickly if she was to regain any advantage. To her,Alexander and Lily were not allies-they were obstacles standing between her and her mother's ambitions. She quickly slipped away into the shadows, planning her next move.

As Alexander's phone buzzed, he stepped away from Lly to answer the call. Lily, watching Ariana's retreat, felt a chill run down her spine.She knew better than to trust Ariana, despite the truce they had formed earlier under dire circumstances. Lily's loyalty was always to Alexander, and her hatred for Ariana and Carolina ran deep.

“It's me,Maxwell," came the gruff voice on the phone. "We need to talk-there's something Caleb's been hiding. He mentioned a vault beneath the estate, a secret he's kept even from you.”

Alexander's grip on the phone tightened, his gaze darting to Lily,who was still tracking Ariana's movement. “A vault? What's inside?"
Meanwhile, in a remote, opulent study, Carolina's rage was boiling over.She had received word of The Architect's downfall and, worse,her daughter Ariana's apparent failure to carry out their plans. She paced back and forth, her mind spinning with new strategies.

"Your daughter has abandoned us, madam," said Samuel, her trusted confidant, as he stood by the door, watching Carolina's temper flare.“She's gone rogue."


"She's a fool!" Carolina snapped, slamming her hand on her desk.“To think she could go against me and side with no one! This is what happens when you let ambition cloud your judgment. But she will learn, just like Lily and Alexander will learn-no one crosses me and walks away unscathed.”


Samuel remainedI silent, though he shared Carolina's concern. While she plotted her revenge, he couldn't help but notice how the balance of power was shifting with The Architect's capture. Whoever found Caleb's secret vault would hold a power none of them had imagined, and that could turn everything on its head.



Alexander met Maxwell in a secluded corner of the estate, under the cover of shadows. Maxwell looked exhausted, his clothes dirty from the earlier battle,but his determination was unyielding.

“I've been digging into Caleb's past," Maxwell began. “He's tied to a vault beneath this estate, something he kept from everyone-even you. It's not just about wealth,Alexander. It's about something far bigger."

Alexander was skeptical but intrigued. "What could be so important that Caleb would hide it from everyone? Why keep it a secret all this time?"
Maxwell's expression darkened. “Whatever it is, it's dangerous. If we don't get to it first, Carolina will. And you know what that means-she'll use it against you, against Lily. Against everything we've built."

Alexander thought of Lily and their plans. He couldn't allow Carolina or Ariana to get the upper hand. “Then we find it. Tonight.”

***

At that same time, Ariana made her way through a dense forest path,far from the prying eyes of Alexander and Lily. She clutched a small,encrypted drive in her hand-a piece of The Architect's old plans she had salvaged before his capture. She knew that her mother, Carolina, would be furious, but she also knew she couldn't let herself be overshadowed by either her mother's plans or Alexander's ambitions.

As she pushed through the underbrush, she thought of her next steps. She needed allies,resources-anything that would give her leverage over the others. She reached a small, abandoned cabin where she had stashed weapons and equipment, and began setting up a secure communication line.


Aríana's lips curled into a bitter smile. “You think you've won, Lily. You think you've outsmarted me, Alexander, But the game is far from over.Let's see how you handle this,"




***


Back at the estate, Caleb sat alone in his private study, pouring himself a glass of whiskey. He had lived through the rise and fall of many power players, but he knew that the coming days would be the most dangerous yet. He had spent years keeping his secret hidden-something in that vault that could change the course of their entire world. And now,
everyone was circling like vultures, hoping to uncover it.

But as he drained his glass, Caleb made a decision. He would not let anyone, not even his own family, dictate the terms of his legacy.He would fight for his secrets, and if it meant facing off against Alexander, Carolina,or even Ariana, then so be it.


The battle for control was far from over, and as the sun began to rise over the estate, the shadows of a new conflict loomed over everyone. And the question remained: who would be the first to unlock the truth hidden beneath the estate-and who would be willing to pay the price?
###Chapter 177

Ariana paced inside the small cabin, her mind racing with plans and counterplans. She was determined not to let Lily or Alexander gain the upper hand, especially after the chaos they had all endured. Ariana's hatred for Lily ran deep-she despised her for standing by Alexander,for trying to play the perfect wife while secretly maneuvering to keep Ariana and Carolina at bay. Ariana saw Lily as a traitor, someone who had sided with the enemy and betrayed any chance of an alliancebetween them.In Ariana's eyes, there was no room for forgiveness or truce.

She focused on the encrypted drive she had managed to steal during the chaos. The data contained snippets of the Architect's plans, though fragmented. Ariana believed that if she could piece together the information, it might give her leverage-not just over Alexander and Lily,but even over her mother, Carolina. It was risky, but Ariana knew that in this game, risks had to be taken.

A sudden ping from her secure line brought her out of her thoughts.It was a message from a contact she'd paid handsomely to keep her hidden.The message read: “Caleb's vault is the key. Alexander is searching for it.Carolina too."


Ariana's face darkened. "So they know about the vault," she murmured to herself. Her thoughts drifted to Caleb, Lily's grandfather.He had always been a wild card-unpredictable, and with a history that was deeply entwined with power and secrets. If Caleb's vault truly contained something that both Alexander and Carolina wanted, then it could tipthe scales in this power struggle.

She knew she needed to act fast. She couldn't afford to let Alexander or his beloved Lily reach the vault first. "It's time to disrupt their little family
reunion," she said with a smirk, slipping her encrypted drive into her bag.She had no intention of letting the two of them enjoy their advantage.

***

Back at the estate, Lily and Alexander were in Caleb's study, trying to extract whatever information they could about the hidden vault. Alexander had confronted Caleb earlier, pressing him for answers, but his grandfather-in-law had been cryptic, insisting that some secrets were better left buried.Caleb's words lingered in Alexander's mind: “You think you understand power, but there are things even you aren't prepared to face.”

Lily, however, was less patient. She knew that Ariana would stop at nothing to turn the tables, and the longer they stayed in the dark about the vault's contents, the more vulnerable they were. “Alexander, we have to push harder. Caleb's keeping something from us, and we can't afford to be blindsided by Ariana.”


Alexander glanced at Lily, seeing the determination in her eyes. He knew she was right-Lily always had a way of cutting through the noise and focusing on what needed to be done. But he also knew thatCaleb's secrets could be dangerous.“If we push too hard, we might unleash something we can't control," he warned.


Lily crossed her arms, her gaze steady. "We don't have a choice. Ariana is out there, plotting against us. She won't stop until she takes us down. We need to stay ahead."

As they argued, Caleb watched them from the shadows of his study.listening to every word. A deep sigh escaped him. He knew the time was near-soon, the vault would be uncovered, and with it, the dangerous truth that he had kept hidden for so long. But Caleb also knew that revealing it could destroy everything he had built, everythinghis family
had fought for.


***


Meanwhile, Carolina had received her own intelligence about the vault and the renewed conflict between her daughter, Ariana, and Alexander's family.She sat in her luxurious office, her fingers tapping rhythmically on the desk. She was furious-furious at Ariana for going rogue, furious at Alexander and Lily for their interference, and furious at Caleb for withholding crucial information.

“Ariana thinks she can act alone, but she's still a child playing with fire,"Carolina hissed to herself."And Alexander and that wife of his-always so sure of themselves, as if they've already won. But I will show them what it means to cross me."

Carolina picked up the phone and dialed a number. “It's time to move forward with our plan. Get ready for the next phase," she ordered, her voice icy and commanding. She had her own mnethods of finding the vault,and she wouldn't let anyone-not Alexander, not Lily, and certainly not Ariana-stand in her way.

As she ended the call, Carolina's eyes glinted with a dangerous resolve.“Let the games begin," she muttered under her breath.



***


A few miles away, Ariana slipped through the forest, making her way back towards the estate. She had no intention of going in directly-she wasn't foolish enough to face Alexander and Lily head-on. Instead, she planned to watch them, to use the information she had to disrupt their efforts. She knew that the vault was the key to everything, but what she didn't know was how far Caleb would go to protect it.
Just as she reached the edge of the estate grounds, she caught sight of movement in the distance. It was Lily, standing by one of the estate's old gates, talking quietly to Maxwell. Ariana crouched down, staying hidden among the trees, and strained to hear their conversation.

"...must find the vault before Carolina makes her move," Lily was saying,her voice firm."And we need to ensure that Ariana doesn't get in our way.



Maxwell nodded, glancing around warily. “I've already put extra security on the estate, but we need to be ready for anything. Caleb isn't giving up his secrets easily.”


Ariana's grip tightened around the branch she was holding. She had heard enough. With a grim smile, she turned and retreated back into the woods, her mind racing with a new plan. If Alexander and Lily thought they could outmaneuver her, they were wrong. Ariana would ensure that this game of secrets and power ended on her terms.

She was done playing by everyone else's rules. Now, it was time for her own.



In his study, Caleb watched the hidden monitors displaying the movements around the estate. He knew where each piece was positioned in this dangerous game-Alexander, Lily, Ariana, Carolina. And he knew that the final act was about to begin. But what none of them realized was that the vault held more than just secrets.

It held a power that, once unleashed, could change everything they thought they knew. And Caleb, for better or worse, was prepared to make sure that whoever reached it first would pay a price none of them could

###Chapter 178

As dawn broke, the estate seemed quiet, but tensions simmered beneath the surface. While Alexander and Lily plotted with Maxwell about the secret vaualt. Ariana remained hidden in the forest, determined to carve out her own path. Unbeknownst to them all, Carolina had already set her sights on uncovering Caleb's secret-and she was prepared to do whatever it took.


In the grand halls of the estate, Alexander confronted Caleb in his study.The older man looked weary, but his eyes held a stubborn resolve as he studied his grandson's determined expression.

"Caleb,you need to tell me what's in that vault. If Carolina gets to it first.we lose everything." Alexander insisted, his voice low but intense. He knew that time was running out, and every second they wasted brought Carolina closer.


Caleb swirled the whiskey in his glass, staring into the amber liquid as if it held all the answers. "Some secrets are buried for a reason, Alexander. If I tell you what's in that vault, you might not like what you find."

Alexander leaned closer, his patience fraying. “It's not just about me. It's about protecting Lily, our family-everything we've built. If this is about power,then I need to know."

Caleb's gaze finally met his, the shadows under his eyes deepening. “It's not just power. Alexander. It's a history that could tear this entire family apart. You think the battles you've fought so far are the worst of it? You have no idea what you're dealing with."
Meanwhile, in the hidden cabin, Ariana worked through the encrypted data she had taken from The Architect's files. She was alone but focused.piecing together the remnants of his plans, hoping to find a weakness she could exploit. A small smile played on her lips as she uncovered a map-a layout of the underground passages beneath Caleb's estate.


"This is my way back in," she muttered to herself."And my way to get ahead of Alexander and Lily."

She couldn't afford to let them find the vault before her. If they did,she would lose the last chance she had to prove herself-to her mother,to herself. and to everyone who thought she couldn't stand on her own.Ariana set the map aside, picked up a burner phone, and made a call.

"Meet me at the old estate tunnels," she instructed the person ona the other end.“I need backup, and this time, we do it my way."

***

Back at Carolina's residence, she sat at a lavish breakfast table, her expression a mask of composure as she read through the latest reports from her informants. Her fury at Ariana's betrayal had cooled into a cold determination. She knew that her daughter's defiance had only made things more complicated, but she wasn't going to let that deter her.


Samuel approached, carrying a slim tablet. "Ma'am, we've received confirmation-Ariana has made contact with an unknown ally. It seems she's planning to make a move on the estate."

Carolina raised an eyebrow, a sardonic smile tugging at her lips. "So, my daughter is finally trying to play the game on her own. Let her try-she'll realize soon enough how far out of her depth she really is."
Samuel hesitated, then added, “But there's another issue, ma'am. The media is reporting that no one was in the car that crashed. They're speculating that Lily faked her death."

Carolina's smile faded. "Lily is alive? Interesting..."

She considered her options, realizing that her plans would need to shift yet again. If Lily and Alexander were still in play, then the stakes had just gotten higher. Carolina's mind whirled withi new strategies, and she knew she needed to strike before anyone else could gain the upper hand.

"Prepare the team," she ordered Samuel. "If Ariana wants to play with fire,let's see how she handles a real blaze. We're going to the estate, and we'll be theones to find that vault-before anyone else."



In the estate's underground tunnels, Lily and Maxwell had taken a different path. With Lily's knowledge of her grandfather's tendencies and Maxwell's skills at deciphering hidden routes, they navigated the maze-like passages beneath the estate. Lily had one hand on her weapon, the other clutching a flashlight as they pressed forward.

“You really think Caleb would keep something like this a secret from you?"Maxwell asked as they turned a corner, the air growing colder and damper the deeper they went.

Lily's expression was grim. “He's always been protective of certain parts of the estate's history. But I know him-he's hiding something big.something he's afraid will change everything."

Maxwell nodded, glancing at the map he had sketched from their conversations, “Well, whatever it is, we'll find it. Just keep your eyes
open-no telling who else might be down here."

They continued their descent, unaware that Ariana, Alexander,and Carolina's forces were all converging on the same destination. Each one held pieces of the puzzle, but none knew the full picture.

And in the shadows, a figure moved silently, watching them all-someone who had yet to reveal their hand in this deadly game. A new player,waiting for the perfect moment to strike and upend the fragile balance of power that everyone else fought so desperately to control.

The battle for the vault, for power, and for survival was just beginning,and no one could predict how it would end.
###Chapter 179

As night fell over the estate, the air seemed to hum with tension, as if the grounds themselves sensed the coming storm. In the dense forest surrounding the estate, Ariana and her new ally, a shadowy figure she referred to only as "Raven," moved silently through the underbrush. Raven had a reputation as a master of subterfuge and had been an enigma in the criminal underworld for years. Ariana had managed to convince him to join her cause with promises of a substantial reward and a chance to take down powerful enemies.

“Are you sure this is the right tunnel?” Raven whispered, his voice barely more than a breath among the rustling leaves. He surveyed the entrance to the underground passage they had discovered.

Ariana nodded, a determined look in her eyes. “This leads directly to the old vault room. We need to get there before Lly, Maxwell, or my mother can interfere.Once I have what's in that vault, I'll finally have leverage."

Raven smirked, adjusting the strap of his bag filled with gear. “Just don't forget your end of the deal, Ariana. I didn't sign up for a wild goose chase.



Aríana didn't reply, her mind already racing with thoughts of what she might find in the vault. She knew her mother was coming for her, and she needed to secure her position before Carolina's men closed in. Together,they slipped into the dark mouth of the tunnel, the sound of their footsteps swallowed by the earth.



***


Inside the mansion, Alexander and Lily regrouped in Caleb's study after their search of the tunnels came up empty. Alexander's frustration was
palpable as he paced the room, running a hand through his hair.

"Lily, we're missing something. Caleb knows more than he's letting on.”Alexander said, glancing at his wife. “He warned me about the vault,but he's holding back the real reason why it's so important."

Lily watched him, her expression serious but filled with concern.“Maybe he's trying to protect you, Alexander. Or maybe there's something in that vault that could change everything we know about this famaily.”

Alexander stopped, turning to face her. “Whatever it is, I can't let Carolina or Ariana get their hands on it. We need to find out what Caleb is hiding before they do."

Just as he finished speaking, the door creaked open and Caleb entered.leaning heavily on his cane. His eyes were tired, but a hint of defiance glinted in their depths.

“You're both right.” Caleb began, taking a seat. “There's something in that vault that could ruin us, but it's not what you think. It's not just about money or power-it's about a secret that could change everything for this family. And it's a secret I've tried to keep buried for decades."

Alexander and Lily exchanged a look, theircuriosity piqued. “Tell us,Caleb. If we're going to protect this family, we need to know everything."Alexander urged.


Caleb took a deep breath, then finally began to speak. “Years ago,before you were even born, Alexander, our family made a deal-a pact with people far more dangerous than Carolina or Ariana could ever imagine.That vault holds proof of that agreement, and if it gets out,it could bring down not just our family, but half of the city's most powerful figures."
Lily's eyes widened. "What kind of agreement, Grandpa?"

Caleb's gaze hardened. "One that would change everything we know about loyalty and trust."

***

Meanwhile, Carolina stood on the edge of the estate's grounds, watching as her men prepared for the raid. She had received word from Samuel that Ariana and her mysterious ally had entered the tunnels, and she wasn't about to let her daughter outmaneuver her again.

"Prepare to breach the tunnels," she ordered, her voice cutting through the night air. “Ariana thinks she's ahead, but she's just a pawn. Once we have control of that vault, I'll be the one holding all the cards."

Samuel nodded, signaling the men to move in. But just as Carolina turned to issue more orders, a muffled explosion echoed through the trees.Her head snapped toward the sound, eyes narrowing as she realized it came from deeper within the estate's underground.

“Damn it, they're already inside," she muttered, her expression twisting with fury.“We need to move now!"


But as Carolina's forces surged forward, the ground beneath them rumbled-Aríana and Raven had triggered a trap within the tunnels,collapsing part of the passage to slow down any pursuit.



***


In the darkness of the collapsing tunnel, Ariana and Raven sprinted through the dust-filled air. The explosion had bought them time, but they knew it wouldn't be long before Carolina's men found another way inside.
“You really know how to make an entrance," Raven remarked, his tone sardonic even as they ran.


Ariana shot him a sideways glance. “Just keep moving. We're almost there.



But as they rounded a corner, a shadowy figure stepped out of the darkness, blocking their páth-Maxwell, holding a gun, his expression cold.

“You're not going any further. Ariana,”" he said, voice steady.“I'm taking you in, and we're ending this tonight."

Ariana stopped in her tracks, glaring at him. “You think you can stop me,Maxwell? You're outnumbered."


Maxwell tilted his head, a smirk forming on his lips. “Am I?”

Behind him, Lily emerged from the shadows, her own weapon trained on Raven. "Drop the bag, Raven. You're not taking anything from that vault."

Ariana's jaw clenched, realizing they were cornered. But just as it seemed like the standoff would end in gunfire, the rumbling of engines echoed through the tunnels-Carolina's men, breaking through the other side.

Raven cursed under his breath, dropping the bag as instructed. “Looks like your motheris joining the party."


Lily's grip on her gun tightened, her eyes narrowing. "It doesn't matter.We're taking you in, Ariana, and you're going to answer for everything you've done.”


But Ariana, ever the opportunist, lunged to the side, disappearing into a narrow crevice in the tunnel wall. "Not today," she called back, her voice echoing through the chamber as she vanished into the shadows,leaving
her ally behind.

Maxwell moved to follow, but Lily put a hand on his arm. “Let her go. We have bigger problems-Carolina's not far behind, and she won't stop until she has what she's looking for."

Maxwell hesitated but nodded, realizing she was right. They turned their focus back to the bag Raven had dropped,hoping it held clues that could lead them to the vault-and to the secrets Caleb had tried so hard to keep hidden.


As the echoes of Carolina's forces grew louder, the tension between allies and enemies reached a breaking point. And somewhere in the darkness,Ariana slipped away, her mind already forming a new plan-a plan that would change the game once more.
###Chapter 180

As Carolina's forces closed in on the tunnel, the air inside crackled with anticipation. Lily and Maxwell, aware that they couldn't face Carolina's men head-on in the tight quarters, grabbed the bag Raven had dropped and moved quickly down a side passage that would lead back to the estate.They had to regroup, find out what secrets the bag held, and decide their next move.


Carolina, furious at having lost Ariana again, stalked through the tunnels as her men spread out to secure the area. Her eyes were cold as she surveyed the aftermath of the explosion that had nearly trapped her outside. She knew Ariana was still out there, plotting-just as she knew Lily and Maxwell were now closer than ever to uncovering secrets she had fought to keep hidden.

But as Carolina's men combed through the area, a small device hidden in the tunnel wall began to beep softly. It was a motion-activated signal jammer, placed by Raven before their intrusion, designed to disrupt radio signals. Carolina's team's communications went dark, leaving them in confusion. Raven might have been left behind, but he had not left without one final trick up his sleeve.

"Ma'am, we're losing contact with the outside team!" one of her men shouted, his voice barely audible over the static. Carolina's eyes narrowed in suspicion, realizing Ariana had planned this move to sabotage her efforts. She clenched her fists, knowing that her daughter's cunning could yet turn the tide of this dangerous game.

***

Back at the estate, Caleb was deep in thought, staring out the window of
his study as rain began to pour outside. He knew time was running out.Ariana had escaped,Carolina was closing in, and the contents of the bag now in Maxwell and Lily's possession could unravel everything he'd kept buried. The decades-old secret involving the family's dealings was on the brink of exposure, and he feared what would happen if Alexander learned the full truth.

When Lily and Maxwell burst into the room, drenched and exhausted,Caleb turned to face them, his expression grave. Lily tossed the bag onto the desk, scattering documents and a small metal box with a rusted lock.


"We found this in the tunnels. It's got to have something to do with the vault," Maxwell said, catching his breath.

Caleb's eyes darkened ashe saw the old box. “You have no idea what you've uncovered," he murmured, his voice barely above a whisper. He hesitated, then reached for the key around his neck-a key he'd kept hidden for years. With a shaking hand, he unlocked the box, revealing a stack of faded letters and an old photograph of a younger Caleb standing alongside a mysterious man with a scar across his face.


Alexander stepped forward, his face pale as he picked up the photograph.“Who is this? And what does it have to do with our family?”

Caleb closed his eyes, the weight of years pressing down on him.“His name was Silas... and he was the one who brokered the pact with our famíly, a deal that kept our enemies at bay. He's dead now, but his allies still hold power-and if they learn that this evidence has surfaced, they will come for all of us."

Lily glanced at the letters, recognizing some of the names of powerful figures in the city-people they had crossed paths with, some of whom had helped Carolina. "These letters... they're blackmail material. Is that
why you kept this hidden, Grandpa?”

"Yes,”Caleb admitted. “Silas was ruthless, but he kept other dangerous figures in line. When he died, I hid this evidence, hoping it would never resurface. But it seems that fate has other plans."

Alexander's jaw clenched as he took in the implications."We need to destroy this, then. If Carolina or Ariana get their hands on it, they could use it to control half the city.”

Lily, however, shook her head. "No, Alexander. We need to use this as leverage. If we destroy it, we lose our last chance to turn the tables. We could bring down Carolina's allies, expose the truth, and finally put an end to this feud.”


Maxwell nodded in agreement. “She's right. We have a chance to change the game. But it won't be easy-Carolina won't back down, and Ariana is still out there."


Alexander turned to Caleb, seeking guidance.“What do you think?”

Caleb's gaze lingered on the photograph, a haunted look in his eyes.“This is a dangerous path, but perhaps it's the only way to end this once and for all. If we're going to do this, we'll need to move quaickly. Carolina will realize soon enòugh that her signals are being jammed. And Ariana... she s always one step ahead."

***

Meanwhile, deep in the city, Ariana paced back and forth in a rundown hideout, her face illuminated by the flickering light of a single lamp. She had narrowly escaped through the tunnel network, but she knew her time was running out. Raven had been captured, her plans were falling apart,
and now Carolina's pursuit was relentless. Yet as she glanced at a map of the estate and surrounding tunnels, a dark determination settled over her.

"They think they've won, but they have no idea what's coming next," she muttered to herself, her mind spinning with the possibilities. She reached for a burner phone and made a call to one of her last remaining contacts-someone with ties to the remnants of Silas's old network.


“It's me. I need your help," Ariana said, keeping her voice low. “The evidence is out in the open, and if it reaches the wrong hands, we're all finished.”


The voice on the other end was gruff, but there was a hint of intrigue."I thought you'd never ask, Ariana. But this won't come cheap."

"Just be ready," she replied, her tone icy. “I'll make sure you're compensated-after we get that evidence back.”

As she ended the call, Ariana's lips curled into a grim smile. She wasn't finished yet-not by a long shot. And while Lily and Alexander thought they held the upper hand, she intended to prove that the game was far from over.


Back at the estate, as the rain hammered against the windows, Lily,Alexander, and Caleb prepared for the storm that was coming. With the secrets of the past out in the open, alliances would be tested, and the battle for control was about to enter its most dangerous phase yet.
###Chapter 181

As the rain poured down and lightning flashed across the sky,tensions inside the estate rose to a breaking point. Lily, Alexander, and Caleb huddled over the old letters, trying to piece together a plan before Carolina and her allies could strike again. The sound of the storm outside matched the urgency inside, as if nature itself was reflecting the chaos that had engulfed their lives.


In a dimly lit corner. Lily's mind raced. She clutched one of the letters tightly, her thoughts shifting to the enemies they now faced. She had once believed Ariana was the real threat, but now Carolina's power and reach loomed even larger. And while Lily had no love for Ariana,she understood the danger of underestimating Carolina, especially when family ties were tangled in betrayal and hidden secrets.

“Grandfather,you mentioned Silas's allies-do you think any of them are still loyal?” Lily asked, turning to Caleb.


Caleb's face tightened with worry. “It's possible. Silas had connections everywhere. Some of his old allies might see this as a chance to reclaim their influence, but others might side with Carolina if they think she has the upper hand."

Alexander's eyes narrowed. "Then we'll have to find out who's willing to join us. We'll reach out to those who might be open to switching sides before Carolina gets to them."

Maxwell, standing near the window, kept watch over the rain-soaked grounds outside. "We'll also need to double security around the estate.Carolina will likely strike soon. And Ariana... she's unpredictable. If she's desperate,she might try to manipulate anyone she can."
Lily nodded, her resolve hardening. “Then let's use that to our advantage.We'll make contact with anyone we can trust and turn them against Carolina. And if Ariana tries anything, we'll be ready."



Meanwhile, in a hidden part of the city, Ariana sat with her newfound ally,a shadowy figure who had once been a close associate of Silas. The old man, knowvn only as Gideon, leaned back in his chair, studying Ariana with a shrewd gaze. The dim light revealed the deep lines on his face,each a testament to years of surviving in the city's underworld.

“You've got ambition, Ariana,” Gideon said, his voice gravelly. “But ambition without caution can be dangerous. I'm willing to help you,but I want my share if we manage to take down Caleb and reclaim what's ours."

Ariana's expression remained cold.“You'll get what you deserve, Gideon,but make no mistake-I'm in charge here. Carolina might think she's running the show, but she's forgotten that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to win."


Gideon chuckled, a raspy sound that echoed in the smnall room.“We'll see,won't we? Just remember-if you double-cross me, you'll regret it."

Ariana gave him a thin smile, knowing that trust was a luxury she couldn't afford. She glanced at the map spread out between them, marking key locations near the estate. It was time to outmaneuver Carolina, and if she had to, she would sacrifice anyone who stood in her way.



Back at the estate, Caleb received a call from one of his old contacts-a man who had remained neutral for years but now sensed a shift in the
balance of power. The man warned him that Carolina had mobilized her forces and was planning to make a direct assauult on the estate before dawn.Caleb's expression grew grim as he relayed the information to Lily,Alexander,and Maxwell.


“She's coming for us tonight," Caleb said, his voicesteady despite the gravity of the news. "We need to be ready.”

Alexander clenched his fists, the determination in his eyes matching the tension in the air. "We've fought off worse before. We'll fight them off again.”

But just as they were about to finalize their plans, the door to the study burst open, and a young guard rushed in, his face pale with urgency.

"Sir,there's something on the news-you need to see this."

Lily grabbed the remote and turned on the television. A live broadcast appeared on the screen, showing a reporter standing near the scene of the car crash from earlier that day. Flames still smoldered in the background,but the reporter's words struck like a lightning bolt.

“Authorities have just confirmed that no bodies were found inside the burníng vehicle, leading to speculation that the occupant may have escaped before the crash. This revelation casts doubt on earlier reports, and the investigation is ongoing.”

Alexander's heart skipped a beat as relief flooded through him. He turned to Lily, his voice barely a whisper. "She wasn't in the car... Lily's alive."

Lily let out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding. "She outsmarted them,"she murmured, a hint of a smile forming. "That means she's still out there, planning her next move,"
Caleb's expression softened, but the gravity of their situation remained.“It's a small victory, but we can't let our guard down. Carolina will be furious when she learns that Lily escaped. She'll come at us even harder now."

***

Elsewhere, in a dimly lit alleyway, Lily watched the broadcast from a small phone screen, hidden beneath a hooded jacket. The rain poured down around her, but she felt a renewed sense of determination. She had managed to evade the trap, but now she had to make sure Carolina and Ariana would pay for everything they had done.

Taking out another burner phone, she dialed a number and waited for the person on the other end to pick up. A familiar voice answered,rough yet steady. It was someone she hadn't contacted in a long time-a former ally who owed her a favor.


"It's me. I need your help."

The voice on the other end paused, then replied, "What do you need.Lily?



Lily glanced around, making sure she wasn't being watched. “I'm taking Carolina and Ariana down. But I need backup. Are you in?”

A chuckle came through the line, followed by a confident response. “I've been waiting for this call. Count me in."

As Lily ended the call, she allowed herself a brief smile. She had a plan,and this time, she wouldn't let anything stand in her way. Carolina and Ariana might have thought they could trap her, but they were about to find out just how wrong they were.

Back at the estate, Caleb, Alexander, and Maxwell prepared for the coming
confrontation, unaware that Lily had already set a new plan in motion.With allies forming on both sides and secrets unraveling at every turn, the storm that raged outside was nothing compared to the one brewing within their world.
###Chapter 182

As the night deepened, the atmosphere in the estate grew tense. Caleb.Alexander, and Maxwell finalized their preparations, arming their guards and securing the perimeter. Outside, the storm raged on, creating a symphony of thunder that echoed through the estate grounds. Inside,however, the real storm was still brewing, with every passing second tightening the knot of uncertainty in their chests.

Lily was out there somewhere, alive but in danger, and Carolina and Ariana were still plotting in the shadows. Alexander's mind raced with the possibilities, wondering what Lily's next move would be. He knew she wouldn't sit back and wait for the fight to come to her. That was never her style.


Suddenly, a coded message came through on Alexander's phone-a signal from one of their scouts monitoring the perimeter. He read it quickly, his eyes widening as he processed the information.

"They're here. Carolina's men are moving in on the south side,” Alexander announced,turning to Maxwell and Caleb. "We need to move, now.”

Maxwell nodded, gripping his weapon. “I'll take my team and intercept them. You two stay here and cover the main entrance."

Caleb placed a reassuring hand on Alexander's shoulder.“We've survived worse. We'll get through this too. Just stay focused."

With a final nod, Maxwell headed out, disappearing into the rain-drenched night with a small sqquad of guards. Alexander and Caleb remained inside.their minds racing as they anticipated the confrontation that would soon erupt.


Across town, in a shadowy, abandoned warehouse, Lily met with her newly reactivated ally, a woman named Selene, who had once served as a top strategist in Caleb's circle before disappearing into the criminal underworld. Selene had always been one step ahead, and Lily knew she'd need that edge to stand any chance against Carolina's vast network.

Selene eyed Lily with a mixture of amusement and curiosity. “I have to admit, when you called me, I thought you might have been bluffing. But seeing you here... I see you haven't lost your nerve.”

Lily smirked. “Bluffing has never been my style. Carolina thinks she's untouchable, but she's made too many enemies. We just need to turn the right screws."

Selene nodded thoughtfully, her fingers tracing the edges of a map spread across a rusty table. “Carolina's got a lot of muscle, but if we play this right, we can make her own allies turn on her. Divide and conquer."

“Exactly,"Lily replied, her eyes gleaming with determination. “I have intel that some of Carolina's mercenaries aren't as loyal as she thinks. A few strategic leaks, and we can have them questioning their allegiance."

Selene leaned fòrward, a sharp grin crossing her face. “Let's make this war messier than she ever imagined."



Meanwhile, back at the estate, the battle between Maxwell's team and Carolina's forces erupted in the woods beyond the south perimeter.Gunfire echoed through the rain, mixing with the thunder as shadows clashed among the trees. Maxwell fought with precision, his years of
military training coming to bear as he directed his men through the chaos.

But Carolina's forces were numerous and aggressive, pressing their advantage in the darkness. Just when it seemed Maxwell's team might be overwhelmed, he heard a distant rumble-a convoy of unmarked vehicles tearing through the forest, headlights cutting through the rain.

Maxwell's heart sank, thinking it was more of Carolina's reinforcements.But to his surprise, the vehicles skidded to a stop, and men in tactical gear leapt out, turning their weapons not on him, but on Carolina's men.

As the new arrivals joined the fray, turning the tide in Maxwell's favor,he spotted a familiar figure stepping out of the lead vehicle, her long coat flapping in the wind. It was Lily, her expression fierce as she gave orders to the newcomers.

"You really thought I'd sit this one out, Maxwell?” Lily shouted over the gunfire,flashing a defiant grin.

Maxwell chuckled, a mix of relief and admiration. “Wouldn't expect anything less from you. Let's finish this."

With Lily's reinforcements, they began to push back Carolina's men,forcing them into a retreat. The sound of the battle receded as Carolina's forces scattered into the darkness, leaving the estate grounds littered with the remnants of their failed attack.



But as dawn began to break and the rain slowed, a new complication arose.Inside the estate, Alexander and Caleb were catching their breath when a sudden alarm blared through the halls. A panicked guard rushed in,breathless and wide-eyed.
"Sir, we'vegot a problem. Carolina... she's in the building!"

Alexander and Caleb exchanged a look of shock and disbelief. Carolina had managed to slip past the chaos outside and infiltrate their very home.

Alexander grabbed his weapon, adrenaline surging through him.“Where is she?”


"She was spotted heading toward the study, where the old letters and documents are kept."

Caleb's eyes darkened with understanding. “She's going after the leverage we have against her. If she gets her hands on those letters...”

Alexander didn't wait for him to finish. He bolted from the room, Caleb following close behind. They raced through the mansion, their footsteps echoing down the hallways, each step bringing them closer to a confrontation that could shift the entire balance of power.

They burst into the study to find Carolina rifling through the old chest of documents, her expression one of grim determination. She glanced up as they entered, a sly smile crossing her face.

“You think you can outsmart me, Alexander? Caleb? You're just like Silas-too focused on your own games to see the bigger picture."

Alexander leveled his gun at her, his hands steady."Step away from the chest,Carolina. It's over.”


But Carolina just laughed, a cold, mocking sound. “You think I came here to steal these scraps of paper? No, Alexander. I came here to make sure you understand that this is far from over."

She suddenly pulled a small device from her pocket-a remote detonator.
Alexander's heart dropped as he realized what she'd done.

"I've planted explosives throughout this mansion," she said calmly.“You can either let me walk out of here, or we all go down together."

Caleb took a step forward, his face twisted with fury. "You wouldn't dare."

Carolina's smile widened. "Try me."

But before she could press the button, the study door swung open again,revealing Lily standing in the doorway, her eyes blazing with determination.


"Drop it, Carolina," Lily ordered, aiming her own weapon at the remote in Carolina's hand. "I won't give you the chance.”

Carolina hesitated, her gaze flicking between Lily, Alexander, and Caleb.
For a moment, the tension was so thick it seemed the air itself might snap.But then, seeing no way out, Carolina let the remote clatter to the floor, her expression turning venomous.

"This isn't over, Lily. Not by a long shot."

Lily stepped forward, keeping her gun trained on Carolina as she moved to secure the detonator. "We'll see about that. But for now,you're finished.”


As the guards moved in to restrain Carolina, Alexander let out a shaky breath, turning to Lily with a mixture of relief and admiration.

“Just in time, as always,” he said, a small, grateful smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.


Lily returned the smile, though her eyes remained hard. "I told you I
wouldn't let them win.”

As they escorted Carolina out, the storm outside began to clear,revealing the first hints of sunlight breaking through the clouds. But inside,Alexander, Lily, and Caleb knew that the battles ahead would only get more complicated. For now, they had won a crucial victory-but with Ariana still out there, plotting her next move, and new mysteries surrounding Silas's old allies emerging, their strugglefor survival was far from over.
###Chapter 183

The calm that followed Carolina's capture was short-lived. As the sun began to rise over the estate, it cast long shadows that seemed to stretch across the grounds, mirroring the sense of unease that lingered in everyone's mind. Alexander, Lily, and Caleb gathered in the study, their expressions a mix of exhaustion and determination.


Maxwell entered, wiping the rain from his face, his demeanor grim.“Carolina's locked down, but she's refusing to speak about the explosives.We've secured the mansion, but there might be more traps."

Alexander nodded, pacing the length of the room.“We need to sweep every inch of this place. We can't take any risks.”

Caleb's voice was quiet but firm. “It's not just Carolina we need to worry about. Ariana's still out there, and she won't take her mother's capture lightly.”

Lily leaned against the desk, arms crossed, her eyes focused.“We'll be ready for her. And I've sent Selene to intercept any communications she might have with her remaining allies. If Ariana tries to make a move, we'll know before she does."

Maxwell raised an eyebrow. “You really think she'll come for us directly?"

Lily's gaze turned steely. “She's too proud to run. She'll come, but not until she thinks she's got the upper hand."

Alexander turned to Lily, gratitude mingling with the urgency in his voice.
“I don't know what I'd do without you, Lily. You saved us tonight."

Lily smiled slightly, her hand brushing his arm. "We're in this together,
Alex. I'll always have your back.”

***

Meanwhile, miles away, Ariana stood in a sleek, modern apartment overlooking the city. Her expression was cold as she watched the news broadcast about her mother's capture. Reporters buzzed with speculation,but the most critical piece of information hadn't been released yet-Carolina's arrest had been kept under wraps, at least for now.

She clenched her fists, rage seething inside her. “They think they've won.But this is far from over."


One of her remaining loyal associates, a sharp-eyed woman named Daria,approached her cautiously. "What's our next move, Ariana? They've got your mother, and from what I've heard, she didn't manage to plant all the explosives she claimed."


Ariana's lips twisted into a bitter smile. “Of course she failed. But I'll succeed where she couldn't."


She turned to Daria, her expression hardening with resolve."We need to shift our focus. Lily thinks she's won my mother's game, but she doesn't know the one I'm playing. We're going to use her own network against her.”


Daría looked uncertain but nodded. “And what about Maxwell, Alexander,and Caleb? They'll be tightening their security."

Ariana's smile was icy. "Let them. We're going to make them believe they have the upper hand, right until the moment it's too late."
Back at the estate, the team was deep into their search. The security sweep had turned up several small, hidden explosives-most of them duds. It seemed Carolina had been bluffing about the extent of her preparations.But despite the slight relief this brought, Alexander couldn't shake the feeling that something was still amiss.

He voiced his thoughts as he, Lily, and Caleb gathered around the dining table, reviewing the blueprints of the estate. "It doesn't add up. Carolina's never been careless. If she planted those devices, she meant for them to be found."


Lily's brow furrowed as she studied the diagrams. “Maybe she wanted to buy time. Distract us while Ariana put her own plansinto motion.”

Caleb nodded slowly, considering."That would fit their style-divide our focus, make us feel like we've won when the real threat is still coming."

Maxwell,returning from overseeing the final checks outside, caught the tail end of their conversation. “I've doubled the guard patrols. If Ariana's planning anything, she won't get within a mile of this place without us knowing.”


Lily's phone buzzed suddenly, a secure message from Selene. She read it quickly, her face tightening. "Aríana's been making moves in thecity.She's consolidating resources, gathering people. Whatever she's planning, it's going to be big."

Alexander looked to Caleb, then back to Lily and Maxwell. "We need to be one step ahead of her. Whatever Ariana's endgame is, we have to make sure she doesn't get the chance to strike first."
Across town, in the shadows of a warehouse, Ariana stood before a group of hardened men and women-her new allies, culled from the fringes of the underworld and ready to do whatever it took to turn the tide in her favor. She addressed them with a chilling calm, detailing her plan to dismantle Alexander and his family's power, piece by piece.

"They took my mother," she said, her voice carrying a venomous edge.“They think they've won, but they have no idea what's coming for them.Tonight, we make the first strike.”

As the group listened, Daria whispered something into Ariana's ear,causing a flicker of surprise to cross her face. Ariana turned sharply, her expression unreadable as she absorbed the information.

"You're certain?" she asked Daria,her voice low.

Daria nodded,glancing around as if expecting spies in the shadows. “It's confirmed. Lily's contacted someone from Silas's old circle-someone who might be a traitor in their midst.”

Ariana's smile slowly returned, a dangerous glint in her eyes. “Interesting.It seems Lily's been keeping secrets of her own."

She turned back to her gathered allies, her voice rising with renewed determination. "Change of plans. We're going to exploit this little rift. Let's see how much Alexander and his perfect wife trust each other when the pressure's on.”



***


As the day wore on at the estate, the tension remained palpable. Lily had stepped out to the garden for a moment of fresh air, the events of the last few hours weighing heavily on her. She knew Ariana wouldn't give up
easily-she'd seen that cold determination in her eyes too many times.

She barely noticed Alexander approaching until he was beside her,his expression softer than it had been all morning. “Hey,"he said quietly,slipping an arm around her waist. “You okay?”

Lily managed a small smile. “As okay as I can be with Carolina in custody and Ariana still out there."


Alexander squeezed her hand gently. "We'll get through this. Together."

Lily nodded, leaning into his embrace. But even as she did, her mind raced with thoughts of Selene's latest findings, and the secrets she had yet to share with Alexander. The knowledge weighed on her, a dark cloud that threatened to overshadow even their brief moments of peace.

Little did either of them know, Ariana's plans were already set in motion.And soon. a new betrayal would surface-one that could shatter the fragile trust they had built and turn the tide of the conflict in ways none of them could have predicted.
###Chapter 184

A few days passed, and the estate settled into a tense calm. Carolina remained under heavy guard, but her refusal to speak had made interrogation sessions grueling. While she kept her silence, everyone knew it was only a matter of time before Ariana would strike again. Yet the quiet brought no comfort-only the nagging sense that something was brewing beneath the surface.


Lily. Alexander, and Caleb gathered once again in the study,discussing their next moves. But as they strategized, they couldn't ignore the shadow that hung over their alliance-Lily's secret communications with Selene,a fact she hadn't yet disclosed to Alexander. The weight of it pressed on her,threatening to unravel the trust they'd worked so hard to rebuild.

Just as the meeting wrapped up, Caleb's phone buzzed, interrupting their thoughts. He glanced at the screen, and his face darkened with a mix of worry and anger. “There's news,” he announced. “Ariana's gathered support from some of our old rivals. They're aligning with her forone final push."


Alexander's jaw clenched. “She's desperate. She's trying to unite everyone who has a grudge against us."


Lily, sensing the gravíty of the situation, exchanged a quick look with Alexander."Then we need to divide them before they become a true threat.



But before they could dive into further planning, a commotion erupted outside the study doors. Maxwell rushed in, his usual calm replaced with a rare urgency."Alexander,Lily-you need to see this, The news just broke.There's been a development in Carolina's case.”
They followed Maxwell into the living room where a large screen broadcasted the latest headline: *ARREST OF UNDERWORLD FIGURE SPARKS CHAOS-NEW ALLIANCES FORM AS ARIANA PLANS HER NEXT MOVE*. The newscaster's voice carried an edge of urgency."Reports suggest that Carolina's capture has not only galvanized Ariana but has drawn in dangerous allies who want to see the downfall of the Kane family.”


Alexander's expression hardened as the news continued, highlighting new threats to their safety. But then, a surprising twist emerged: a report from an anonymous source claimed that *no human remains were found in the vehicle that burned near the estate*. The implication was clear-Lily had never been inside the car when it crashed.


Alexander turned to Lily, relief washing over his face. “So, you weren't in the car after all. You survived."” But alongside that relief, a question lingered in his eyes-one Lily dreaded answering. "Why didn't you tell me about your plan?”

Lily hesitated, her mind racing for a way to explain without revealing her contact with Selene. “I... I wanted to keep you safe. I needed to be sure it would work before I got your hopes up."

But Alexander wasn't fully convinced. A shadow of doubt crossed his expression.“I trust you, Lily, but secrets don't help us now. If we're going to fight Ariana, we need to be on the same page."

Before Lily could respond, Caleb interrupted. "We can deal with this later.Right now, Ariana's out there rallying forces, and we need to be ready.This might be our last chance to catch her off guard."
Meanwhile, across the city in a dimly lit warehouse, Ariana was having a meeting of her own. Her allies-underworld figures, disgruntled former partners of the Kane family, and a few rogue agents-gathered around a large table. Daria sat beside her, studying a map spread out before them,showing the layout of the estate.


Ariana pointed to a side entrance. “This is where we'll strike. Caleb and his guards will be focused on the front and rear exits-they won't expect an attack from here."


One of the men, a grizzled veteran with a scar running down his cheek,leaned forward.“You're playing a dangerous game, Ariana. If we fail, they'Il hunt us all down.”


Ariana's eyes narrowed, her voice cold and precise. “If you're afraid,feel free to leave. But I assure you, when this is over, it will be Alexander, Lily,and their precious Caleb who will be left broken."

Daria interjected, her tone careful. “We also need to address the matter of your mother, Carolina. The longer she's in their custody, the more likely it is she'll break."


Ariana's face tightened. “I'll deal with her when the time comes. Right now, my priority is making sure they don't see this attack coming."

But even as she spoke, doubt flickered in her mind. Carolina had always been ruthless, but her mother's loyalty had limits. If Carolina started to think Ariana's plan was failing, she might betray her own daughter to save herself. Ariana clenched her fists, forcing herself to focus on the task at hand.


"We move tonight," she declared, silencing the murmurs of uncertainty around the table. "And when we do, the Kane family won't know what hit
them."

***

As dusk settled over the city, back at the estate, Lily found a quiet moment to speak with Caleb. They walked through the gardens, the air filled with the hum of crickets and the rustle of leaves in the evening breeze.

Caleb glanced sideways at Lily, his expression softened by concern.“You seem distracted, Lily. You've been through a lot, but there's something more,isn't there?”


Lily sighed. running a hand through her hair. “I've been keeping things from Alexander. I thought I was protecting him, but now... I'm not so sure.”


Caleb nodded, his gaze thoughtful.“Secrets have a way of growing between people, especially in times like these. But Alexander needs you-honest and whole, by his side.”

Lily looked down, the weight of her decisions pressing on her. “You're right, Caleb. I just hope it's not too late to make things right."

But before they could continue their conversation, Maxwell appeared at the edge of the garden, his expression serious. “We've just intercepted a message from Daria to one of their operatives. It seems Ariana plans to attack tonight."

Lily and Caleb exchanged a look of alarm. “Then we don't have much time," Caleb said, urgency sharpening his voice. "We need to fortify our defenses and prepare for whatever Ariana's planning."
Night fell, and the estate bristled with activity. Guards took up positions,cameras monitored every angle, and Alexander, Lily, and Caleb reviewed their strategy one last time. Yet as they steeled themselves for the impending assault, another piece of the puzzle came into play-one they hadn't anticipated.


Selene, Lily's hidden contact, sent a final message: *Be careful, Ariana has set a trap for you all. She's not planning to attack directly-she's after something much closer to home.*


Lily's eyes widened as the realization hit her. “Alexander, she's not targeting the estate. She's after Viola.”

Alexander's face went pale, and he immediately grabbed his phone to contact the team guarding their daughter. “Get to Viola's room now!Double the guards and lock down her wing of the house.”

But as he spoke, a faint sound echoed through the halls-a single, sharp crack, like glass shattering in the distance. Caleb's face turned grim.“They're already inside."


Ariana's plan was in motion, but so was a new twist. The attack on the estate was a diversion. In the shadows of the mansion, the true battle was about to unfold-a fight not for power or revenge, but for the safety of the innocent. And this time, both sides had more to lose than they ever had before.
###Chapter 185

The tension inside the mansion reached a boiling point as Alexander, Lily,and Caleb raced through the corridors. The sound of footsteps echoed behind them as guards scrambled to secure the estate and keep the intruders out. The crack of glass had come from Viola's wing of the mansion, and they knew Ariana's plan was unfolding faster than they'd anticipated.

When they reached Viola's room, they found the door ajar and the guards unconscious but breathing, slumped against the walls. Panic surged through Alexander as he pushed open the door,fearing the worst-but relief flooded himn when he saw Viola, wide-eyed but unharmed, hiding behind her bed.


"Daddy!"she cried out, rushing into Alexander's arms.

Lily quickly embraced them both, tears welling in her eyes. “You're safe now, darling. We won't let anyone hurt you."

But their relief was short-lived. Maxwell appeared in the doorway,breathless.“We've detained several of Ariana's men, but Daria and a few others are still unaccounted for. We need to get Viola to a safer location."

Caleb nodded, stepping forward with a grim determination. “I'll stay and coordinate the search. Lily, you and Alexander get Viola out of here."

Alexander hesitated, torn between wanting to protect his family and standing by Caleb's side. But Lily squeezed his arm, her voice firm. “We'll keep her safe. Go and finish this, Alexander. End it once and for all."

Alexander met her eyes, seeing the strength there,and nodded.He kissed Viola's forehead, whispered a promise to keep her safe, and then turned to
Caleb. "Let's end this."




Meanwhile, deep within the estate's maze-like halls, Ariana and Daria moved swiftly. They had expected chaos and resistance, but the ease with which they slipped past the guards gave them an unsettling feeling. Daria's brow furrowed. "Something's not right. Ariana. It's too quiet."

Ariana's jaw tightened. She knew Daria was right, but she was too far gone to turn back now. "We stick to the plan. Viola's their weakness,and once we have her, we'll make them all pay."

But as they turned a corner, they found themselves face-to-face with Caleb,Maxwell, and a dozen armed guards. Alexander stepped out from behind them, his expression hard as stone.

"It's over, Ariana," he said, his voice echoing through the hallway. “You've lost. Surrender, and maybe we can finad a way out of this mess for you."

Ariana's eyes blazed with defiance, but a flicker of doubt crossed her face as she took in the scene. She glanced at Daria, who looked back with a resigned expression. “It's done, Ariana. We're surrounded.”

But Ariana wasn't ready to accept defeat. With a final, desperate move,she reached into her coat and pulled out a small device-one last attempt to trigger chaos. Before she could press the button, however, a shot rang out. The device flew from her hand, clattering to the ground,rendered harmless.


Alexander lowered his gun, his hand steady. "I won't let you hurt anyone else.”


Daria,recognizing that they had no escape, raised her hands in surrender.“
I'll testify, Alexander. I'll tell you everything."

Ariana turned to her with a look of betrayal. "“You would side with them?”

Daria's face softened, pity in her eyes. “This war has cost enough lives,Ariana. It's time to stop."

***

As dawn broke over the estate, the echoes of the night's battle faded.Ariana was led away in handcuffs, her face a mask of bitterness. Caleb stood with Alexander, watching as she was placed into a police car.

"I never thought it would come to this," Alexander admitted quietly. “She was like family once.”

Caleb nodded, his expression thoughtful. “Sometimes,people change. But you've protected what matters most, Alexander. You've kept your family safe.”


Alexander turned to see Lily emerging from the mansion, Viola in her arms. Relief washed over him as he saw the smile on their daughter's face,untouched by the darkness that had threatened to consume them all.

Lily joined them, her gaze shifting to Ariana's departing car.“It's over now, isn't it?" she asked softly, leaning into Alexander's side.

He wrapped an arm around her, pulling her close. “Yes. We can finally start over,”

Maxwell approached, a small smile playing on his lips. “The media has already picked up the story. They're talking about how the Kane family managed to thwart a criminal alliance."
Lily laughed softly, shaking her head. “Let's hope this is the last headline we make for a while. I think we've all had enough excitement."

Caleb placed a hand on Viola's head, smiling warmly at his great-granddaughter. “It's time for peace, for all of us. Let's focus on what's important."

As the sun rose higher, bathing the estate in golden light, they all stood together-Lily, Alexander, Caleb, and Viola-ready to face a future free from the shadows of their past.

***

Later that day, Alexander and Lily took a walk through the garden, hand in hand, cherishing the simple quiet that had once seemed impossible.They spoke of their hopes, their dreams, and the life they could finally build together, without looking over their shoulders.

"I never thought we'd have a chance like this,”Lily confessed,glancing up at the blue sky. “After everything that happened, I thought our lives would always be a storm."


Alexander squeezed her hand, a smile softening his face. “Sometimes,storms clear the way for new beginnings. And we're stronger now,together.”

Lily nodded, a tear slipping down her cheek. “I'm just glad that through it all, we never lost each other."
Two weeks later, as the legal proceedings against Ariana began, a sense of closure settled over the estate. Daria's testimony was pivotal, and with her cooperation, the remaining threats were swiftly dismantled. Ariana,facing a long list of charges, remained defiant but isolated-her supporters,seeing the tide turn, had quickly deserted her.

Carolina,confronted with her daughter's downfall, finally broke her silence.She provided the authorities with information that further solidified the case against Ariana, hoping that by doing so, she might find some redemption.

Alexander, Lily, and Caleb attended the hearing, their presence a reminder of the strength that had ultimately triumphed over chaos. As the judge delivered the final verdict, the weight of the past began to lift,and a new  Chapter opened for their family.

***

Months later, life at the estate had returned to a peaceful rhythm. Viola played in the gardens with Caleb, her laughter a sweet melody that filled the air. Lily watched from the porch, her heart full as she sipped her tea.

Alexander joined her, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. “It's been a while since we've had a moment like this."


She leaned into him, smiling, “And it's just the beginning. We have so much to look forward to."

He nodded, his gaze drifting to Viola as she chased butterflies through the flowers."A future where we don't have to be afraid.”

And as the sun dipped low in the sky, casting a warm glow over the estate,they held each other close, ready to embrace whatever came next. For
after all the battles and betrayals, they had found their way back to what truly mattered: family, love, and the promise of a brighter tomorrow.
###Chapter 186

With Ariana behind bars and peace returning to the estate, life began to feel like a new  Chapter had truly begun. The family settled into a comfortable routine, with Lily and Alexander focusing on the simple joys they had missed for so long. Viola had a sparkle in her eyes that had been absent for months, and Caleb séemed môre at ease, savoring the moments with his great-granddaughter.

But amid this newfound calm, another story quietly unfolded-one that they had almost forgotten in the chaos: Carolina's lingering resentmént over her daughter's downfall. Though she had provided information to help secure Ariana's conviction, it wasn't from a place of remorse. Instead,she was driven by a deep-seated anger toward Lily and Alexander,whom she blamed for Ariana's fate.


Carolina,now isolated after distancing herself from her allies, found herself planning a subtle revenge. She knew she couldn't openly challenge the Kane family anymore; they had become too formidable and well-protected.But she wasn't ready to fade away in silence. So, she began to weave a network of contacts among those who still harbored grudges against the Kane estate-a shadowy circle of discontented individuals who might one day pose a threat.




***


Meanwhile, Alexander was unaware of Carolina's plotting. He had been busy solidifying the estate's security and ensuring that all traces of Ariana's influence were eradicated. But as he delved deeper into the estate's history and some old records that Caleb had kept locked away, he discovered something unexpected-a mysterious series of financial transactions that seemed to trace back to the time when Ariana first began
her campaign against their family.

He showed the records to Caleb, who frowned as he reviewed the documents. “I don't recognize these transactions, but it seems like someone within the estate might have been feeding information to Ariana all along."

Alexander's jaw clenched. “You think there's still a traitor among us?"

"It's possible," Caleb replied, histone serious."And if there is, they could still be in contact with Carolina.We need to be vigilant."

This revelation sent a chill through Alexander, and he immediately increased the security measures around the estate. He also shared the information with Lily, who, though shaken, was resolute.“We've come too far to let another threat sneak up on us. Whoever this is, we'll find them."

***

Across town, in a small, nondescript café, Carolina sat at a corner table,meeting with one of her new contacts-a man who had once worked for the estate but had been dismissed for misconduct. He still nursed a grudge against Alexander, and Carolina saw an opportunity to turn his resentment into an asset.


“He's too confident, too certain that his little family is safe," Carolina said,sipping her coffee. “But we'll remind him that not all shadows have disappeared."

The man nodded, a cruel smile twisting his lips. "I'vegot a few tricks up my sleeve. If you want to send a message, I can arrange for a little...surprise."


Carolina leaned in, her voice low and dangerous. "Nothing too drastic yet.
I just want them to know that the past isn't so easily buried."

As they continued their discussion, neither noticed a figure outside the caféwindow-a man dressed in a plain black suit, watching them intently.After Carolina's contact left,the figure made a call.

“Alexander. I think l've found something you'll want to know. Carolina isn't quite as done with you as she seems."

***

Back at the estate, the news reached Alexander, who immediately shared it with Lily and Caleb. They realized that while Ariana's immediate threat was over, Carolina's lingering bitterness could still be a problem. But rather than reacting with fear, they saw it as a chance to finally put an end to the cycle of vengeance.

"I'll talk to her." Lily said firmly. “She's my mother, and maybe-just maybe-she'll listen to me if I approach her alone."

Alexander hesitated, worry etched on his face. “Lily, it's dangerous. You know what she's capable of."


“I know," she replied softly, taking his hand. “But I have to try. We can't keep looking over our shoulders forever.”

Caleb nodded, placing a reassuring hand on his granddaughter's shoulder.
“She's right, Alexander. This might be the only way to bring true peace to our family."

With a deep breath, Alexander relented. He hugged Lily tightly before she left for the meeting, hoping that her courage and love could reach a part of Carolina that hadn't been completely hardened by anger.

Lily met Carolina in a secluded part of the town, far from the estate. The tension between them was palpable, but Lily kept her voice calm as she spoke, "Mother, this needs to stop. Arianamade her choices, and now she's paying for them. Don't throw away the rest of your life chasing a grudge.



Carolina's eyes narrowed, but there was a flicker of uncertainty."You think you know everything, Lily. You think you've won. But you've always been so naïve."


“I'm not asking you to forgive me," Lily continued, her tone steady.“I'm asking you to let go of this before it destroys you too."

For a moment. Carolina's expression softened, as if the weight of her own actions was finally catching up to her. But then she turned away, her face hardening again. "You should go, Lily. Before I change my mind."

Lily knew she had planted a seed, even if Carolina wasn't ready to admit it yet. She left the meeting feeling a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, the darkness that had plagued their family could finally begin to fade.



***


As Lily returned to the estate, Alexander met her at the gate, his relief palpable."How did it go?"

"She's not ready to let go yet, but I think she's starting to see the cost of her anger," Lily said, leaning into his embrace. "We'll need to stay vigilant.but maybe there's a chance she'll come around."

Alexander kissed her forehead, holding her close. "As long as we're
together,we can face whatever comes."

And with that, they walked back to the estate, ready to confront whatever new challenges life might throw their way, but holding on to the hope that this time,they could build a future free of shadows.
###Chapter 187

The months following Lily's tense meeting with Carolina were a time of cautious hope for the family. The estate became a place of warmth and rebuilding,as Alexander and Lily focused on the simple pleasures they had missed for so long-family dinners, walks through the gardens with Viola, and quiet nights by the fireplace. Caleb,too,found peace in seeing his loved ones smile again, the weight of past burdens gradally lifting from his shoulders.


However, the threat of Carolina still loomed in the background, her bitterness unresolved. Alexander had increased security around the estate and was keeping a close eye on any movements she might make. Yet,there had been no sign of retaliation, and they wondered if Lily's words had finally reached her.

***

One crisp morning, as Lily and Alexander enjoyed breakfast on the veranda,Lily hesitated before sharing some unexpected news. She reached across the table,taking Alexander's hand. “Alexander, I need to tell you something."

Alexander looked at her curiously, sensing her nervousness. "What is it?”

She took a deep breath, her eyes glistening with emotion. “I'm pregnant.”"

For a moment, Alexander was speechless, and then a radiant smile spread across his face. He pulled Lily into a tight embrace, his voice thick with emotion."This is the best news, Lily. A new beginning for all of us."

Caleb, who had overheard from the doorway, joined them, his face lighting up with joy. "A great-grandchild! Oh, Lily, this is wonderful news. We
needed this, more than you know."

Viola, who had been playing nearby, ran over, curious about the sudden celebration. “What's going on?”

Lily knelt down to her level, beaming. “You're going to have a little brother or sister,swveetheart."

Viola's eyes widened with excitement. "Really? Wow! Can I help take care of them?”


Alexander laughed, lifting Viola up in his arms. “Of course,you'll be the best big sister ever.”

This moment of pure happiness felt like the beginning of a new  Chapter for the family, one where they could finally leave the shadows of the past behind.


***

Meanwhile,Carolina's circle of influence began to crumble. The man she had met at the café turned on her when he realized that the authorities were closing in. Desperate to avoid punishment, he provided the police with evidence of Carolina's attempts to reignite tensions with the Kane family. This time, there would be no escape for her.

The police arrived at Carolina's secluded home one evening, anad she was taken into custody without resistance. As she sat in the back of the police car,she thought about Lily's words during their last meeting. She realized,with a hollow feeling in her chest, that her own actions had brought her to this point. Alone, she began to reflect on the choices she had made,wondering if there was still time for redemption, even i it came behind bars.
When the news of Carolina's arrest reached the estate, Lily and Alexander shared a somber moment together. “I wanted her to find peace, not end up like this," Lily whispered, leaning into Alexander's arms.

"She made her choices, Lily. But maybe now, she'll find a way to come to terms with everything," Alexander replied gently. "And we can focus on our family and the life we're building.”

Lily nodded, holding onto the hope that perhaps, someday, her mother might find a way to let go of the anger that had consumed her.

***
