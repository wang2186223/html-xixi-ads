###Chapter 1: My Son's Wish

Annie's POV

"Can you and Daddy get divorced?"

My five-year-old son's question hung in the air of his dimly lit bedroom, stopping my bedtime story mid-sentence. Brian looked up at me, fighting to keep his eyes open.

I carefully set down the story book I was reading to him. "Why would you ask that, sweetheart?"

"Because you never let me have any fun," he mumbled sleepily, words slurring slightly. "You won't let me have McDonald's or pizza for lunch like Max does. Sarah says it's okay to have treats sometimes, but you always make me eat those special foods..."

My heart clenched. Brian's food allergies and digestive issues had been a constant battle since he was a toddler. The endless doctor visits, the strict dietary restrictions, the nights spent worrying when he accidentally ate something he shouldn't have—all of it flashed through my mind. "Honey, why would you think—" But he had already drifted off to sleep, his small body curled around his stuffed dinosaur.

Sometimes I wondered if my strict attention to his diet was pushing him away. The truth was clear as the memories flooded into my mind—his sudden reluctance to hug me after school, the way he'd stopped sharing his daily adventures at dinner, how he always seemed distracted when I read him stories. I had been too careless before, or too busy trying to balance the roles of mother and wife, leaving no room for myself. But what choice did I have when he was a delicate boy?

"Sarah says..." My son's words echoed in my ears. Sarah was his teacher's assistant, a woman I had trusted. Why was she discussing divorce and diet with my five-year-old?

I walked out of Brian's room, my mind racing. The house was silent, but the air felt heavy. I headed toward Philip's study. I needed to talk to my husband, to find some grounding in the midst of this unsettling feeling.

When I pushed the door open, the scent of expensive bourbon and old books met me. Philip was sitting behind his desk, the glow of his laptop illuminating the sharp angles of his face. He didn't look up.

"Philip, we need to talk about Brian," I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

"Not now, Annie," he said, his voice cold and dismissive. He finally looked at me, but his eyes were empty of the warmth that used to be there.

He stood up, slowly circling the desk until he was standing directly in front of me. The air between us was thick with a tension I couldn't escape. He stepped into my personal space, his presence looming and cold, effectively blocking my path to the door.

"Philip, please," I whispered, my heart hammering against my ribs. I tried to maintain my composure, but his gaze was like a wall of solid ice.

He didn't listen to my concerns. Instead, he stood there with a calculated stillness, a deliberate display of psychological dominance that felt more like a cage than a conversation. He leaned slightly closer, his face inches from mine, effectively silencing my protests with his sheer intensity. It wasn't an act of love; it was an assertion of emotional ownership, a cold attempt to exert control over the crumbling fragments of our marriage.

I felt a surge of conflicting emotions—the sting of his recent coldness, the suspicion gnawing at my gut, and a chilling realization that the man standing before me had become a stranger. He maintained this suffocating proximity, his silence more commanding than any shout, as if he could stifle my questions through sheer intimidation.

"Is this how you fix things?" I managed to gasp out, my hands trembling.

He didn't answer with words. Instead, he maintained that overwhelming, distant stare, his actions speaking of a man who didn't know how to bridge the emotional distance he had created, opting instead for a silent, mechanical control. In that moment, surrounded by the shadows of the study, I realized that the intimacy we once shared had been replaced by a hollow, performative imitation of a marriage.

When he finally stepped aside, leaving me feeling hollow and shaken, he simply said, "Go to bed, Annie."

I stood there in the silence, watching him turn back to his desk as if nothing had happened. My son wanted a divorce, and my husband was a ghost in my own home. I realized then that my life was a house of cards, and the wind was just starting to blow.
###Chapter 2: A Day of the Housewife

Annie's POV

The early morning light hadn't yet breached our bedroom windows when I found myself staring at the ceiling, my body heavy against the headboard.Philip's steady breathing beside me felt like a metronome counting down the minutes until dawn. My skin still tingled from his touch hours before,but my mind refused to quiet. It just didn't feel right. Was he lying?Enough. Enough of questions like this. I told myself.

The clock on my nightstand blinked 6:30 AM. A sleepless night was completed.


I slipped out of bed, careful not to wake Philip. The floors were cold against my bare feet as I made my way to the kitchen. The morning routine beckoned - Brian's gluten-free breakfast wouldn't prepare itself.His food allergies didn't care about my emotional exhaustion or the growing chasm in our family.


After washing up, I had settled into the familiar rhythm of morning preparation. The organic smoothie ingredients lined up like soldiers on the pristine countertop: frozen berries, spinach, the special protein powder that didn't upset Brian's stomach. The gluten-free pancake mix waited nearby,along with the non-dairy butter that actually tasted decent.


I pulled out my phone,adding items to my grocery store shopping list while the färst pancake sizzled. Philip's dry cleaning needed pickup.The gynecologist appointment at 4:00 PM loomed in my calendar-a routine check-up that suddenly felt loaded with new significance after last night.

The sound of small feet padding down the hallway announced Brian's arrival. "Morning, sweetheart," I called out, sliding a perfectly golden pancake onto his favorite dinosaur plate. "I made your special-" "Did you delete Sarah and disband my family group?" His voice trembled with accusation.

The spatula clattered against the counter. "No, sweetheart."

"Who else would do it?" Tears welled in his eyes. "No wonder she says Daddy doesn't like you!"

My heart stuttered. "What do you mean?"

"Daddy likes Sarah! He told me he's liked her since college!" Brian's small fists clenched. "You're just mean and boring and make me eat stupid food!"

Before I could react, he grabbed his plate and hurled it across the room.The ceramic dinosaur shattered against the wall, pieces of gluten-free pancake sliding to the floor like fallen stars. The organic smoothie followed,purple liquid exploding across our cream-colored cabinets.

Philip appeared in the doorway, his CEO persona already firmly in place despite the early hour. "What's going on here?"

"Mommy deleted Sarah!" Brian ran to Philip, wrapping his arms around his father's legs. "She ruined everything!"

I watched my husband's face, searching for any crack in his perfect mask."Brian, buddy," he soothed, patting our son's head, "sometimes grown-ups need to make difficult decisions."

"But you said you liked Sarah better! You said-" "That's enough, Brian," Philip's voice carried just enough edge to silence our son. "Why don't you go get dressed for school?" After Brian stomped away, Philip straightened his tie. "I'll handle this," he said, not meeting my eyes. "You should start your day - don't you have errands to run?" That was the end of morning I guessed. Yet the morning told me that was just the start.

Traffic snarled hopelessly around Philip's dry cleaner on 86th Street where I watched the minutes tick by on my dashboard clock, knowing his suit needed to be ready for tomorrow's board meeting. The cab driver in front of me laid on his horn as if that would magically clear the gridlock. My head throbbed.


The line at Whole Foods stretched endlessly, each person ahead of me seeming to have a cart overflowing with items to debate with the cashier.I clutched my basket of Brian's special gluten-free items, fighting to keep my eyes open. The fluorescent lights were too bright, making my fatigue-induced headache worse. A baby wailed somewhere in the store, the sound piercing through my skull.

After a lunch that was way past my usual lunchtime, I trudged back to our apartment at around 2 PM.


Usually, I would do some painting at this time to enjoy my quiet afternoon.But today, I just wanted to head straight to the bedroom, where my cozy bed awaited. I could definitely use a nap even for just a few hours before my appointment with my gynecologist at 4:00 PM.

However, as I walked past Philip's home office, something made me pause in the doorway. I saw a photo on his desk. I walked in.

Sarah, younger but unmistakable, laughing on what looked like a college campus. Behind it, folded letters that made my hands shake as I read: "Sarah, despite how you hurt me at college, I can forgive you. Say the word and I'll call off the wedding with Annie." Her response was shorter: "I'm content with my life now. Please don't contact me again." The words blurred as tears threatened to fall. My knees felt weak, and I gripped the edge of his desk to steady myself.

My phone buzzed. Philip's voice came through, rushed and businesslike:

"Annie, I need you to pick up Brian from school today. Something urgent came up- an emergency board meeting."

"What about the ph-" I started, but he cut me off.

"I really can't talk right now. You'll handle it, right?"

The familiar pattern of him delegating parental duties while claiming "important business" suddenly took on a new, bitter meaning.

"Okay," I managed, the word barely a whisper. But he had already hung up.

I thought he loved to pick up Brian too much to let me do it once.

And my nap could wait of course. A mother was a full-time job. At least I could go straight to my gynecologist after that, I said to myself.

At around 3 PM, before the entrance of Brian's school, Several parents were already waiting at the entrance when I arrived.

The electric gates opened, and teachers carefully checked parent names before releasing each child.

"Brian!" the teacher called. "Is Brian's parent here?" "Yes!" I stepped forward, but another voice joined mine. I turned to find Sarah-the woman on the photos - standing there in her red dress, makeup perfect and smile radiant. "Hello, I'm Brian's parent,"she said confidently. The teacher looked at me suspiciously and said to Sarah as if they had seen multiple times, "Ms. Johnson, do you know this woman?"

My blood ran cold. They thought Sarah was Brian's mother?

Sarah extended her hand toward my son. "Brian, come here. Do you know this lady?"

Brian walked to Sarah's side, gripping her hand while staring at me with unfamiliar eyes. After a long pause, he shook his head. "Mommy, I don't know her!"


The world spun as tears filled my eyes. Sarah maintained her polished smile. "Perhaps this woman has confused Brian with someone else."

"I haven't confused anyone," I wiped my tears. "Brian,come here!"

"No!" He hid behind Sarah. "You're not my mom."

The teacher stepped forward protectively. "Should we call the police?"

Sarah nodded. "Just to be safe."

But Icouldn't stop myself. "Brian, I'm your mother!"

"No, you're not!" Brian pressed himself against Sarah. "She's my mommy!"

A cold voice cut through. "Call the police now."
###Chapter 3: Good News?

Annie's POV

I sat in the police station, my hands trembling as I handed over my driver's license. The events at Brian's school kept replaying in my mind-my son's face twisted in fear, his body pressed against Sarah as if seeking protection from a stranger. From his own mother.
"Mrs. Baker," the officer's voice was professionally neutral as she examined my documentation. "We've confirmed your identity and verified your relationship to Brian Baker through the school records."
My throat felt dry. "So you understand now? That I'm his mother?"

She nodded, typing something into her computer. "Yes, ma'am. We've also confirmed Mr. Baker's status as your husband through marriage records."She paused, glancing at me with what might have been sympathy. "The


*Misunderstanding*.Such a mild word for what had happened. For my son looking at me like I was a threat. For Sarah Johnson somehow being listed as a parent at his school.

"Has Mrs. Johnson been frequently visiting the school?" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

The officer consulted her notes. "According to the school logs, she's been authorized to pick up Brian Baker several times over the past month." She hesitated. "The authorization appears to have come from Mr. Baker's office.
"

Of course it had. Everything about this situation carried Philip's perfectly manicured fingerprints.

"We apologize for any distress this has caused," The officer said,standing."You're free to go, but I think you need a conversation with your husband,Mrs.Baker."


As I could finally suck in the air of freedom, the sleepless night was catching up with me. My head throbbed. Of course I couldn't head home just yet. At least, I should find out where my son was first. "Yeah,indeed."I said weakly.


Out of the taxi, I made my way into Philip's office building. I'd been here countless times before, but now everything felt different, tainted.

The security guard recognized me and waved me through. The elevator carried me to the top floor where Philip's office was located.


I heard Philip's voice before I saw him, drifting from the partially open door of the executive lounge.


"...what was I supposed to do?" His familiar laugh, the one he used to charm board members and potential clients, carried clearly. "Sarah left me during our senior year at Harvard. I was devastated."

I froze just outside the door, my hand hovering over the handle.

"But Annie..." a male voice I didn't recognize prompted. "I only married Annie because Sarah was gone," Philip said, his tone matter-of-fact. "Until Sarah came back into my life, I thought I could settle for a life with Annie. And I'm starting to like her. She's a good mother,understanding, and even a bit gullible. And Sarah..." He sighed. "Sarah was my first love after all." My phone buzzed in my purse, making me jump. It was my gynecologist,which seemed trivial compared to the words still hanging in the air.

Philip's voice inside the lounge cut off abruptly.

"Annie?" His face appeared in the doorway, composed as ever except for a slight widening of his eyes. I stared at him, this man I thought I knew,wondering how many other conversations like this he'd had when I wasn't there."What are you-"

His phone rang abruptly, interrupting whatever excuse he'd been about to make. His expression changed as he listened, color draining from his face.

"Brian did what?" His voice sharpened. "We'll be right there."

He grabbed my arm, all pretense forgotten. "Brian's hurt himself. We need to go. Now."

The shock of his words pushed everything else aside- the overheard conversation, the betrayal, all of it disappeared beneath a wave of maternal panic. My legs moved automatically, following Philip to the elevator,to his car, my mind racing ahead to Brian.

Brian lay in the hospital bed, small and pale, his left arm wrapped in gauze. A mild sedative dripped through his IV line.

"He used scissors which are not found yet," the nurse explained quietly. "It's not deep, but given his age..."

I moved toward the bed, but Brian turned his face away.

"Don't," he mumbled. "I don't want you here."

"Brian,sweetheart,please-" He looked at me then, his young face twisted with an expression no five-year-old should wear. "Mom,I know cutting myself makes you upset."

My heart stopped at his words, at the innocent look in his eyes.

"But the more you care, the more I'll hurt myself." His voice was eerily calm. "Until you divorce Dad and let Sarah be my real mom."

The room spun. I heard Philip shouting something, felt hands catching me as my knees buckled. The last thing I saw was Brian's face, watching with that terrible, knowing expression as darkness claimed me. Finally,my exhausted body gave in.

A dreamless sleep I had hoped until I heard the steady beep of a heart monitor. Opening my heavy eyelids, I found myself in an unfamiliar hospitaI room bathed in sunlight - morning sunlight, streaming through the windows. The wall clock read 7:30 AM. I'd lost an entire night to unconsciousness, though in my bone-deep exhaustion, I could have easily slept for days more. The endless hours of worry and heartbreak had finally caught up with me.

Philip sat beside the bed, his suit wrinkled but his expression perfectly controlled.

"How are you feeling?" he asked, reaching for my hand. I pulled away.

"Annie." He leaned forward, his face earnest. "I know things seem difficult right now, but,there's good news." He looked at me then, his young face twisted with an expression no five-year-old should wear. "Mom,I know cutting myself makes you upset."

My heart stopped at his words, at the innocent look in his eyes.

"But the more you care, the more I'll hurt myself." His voice was eerily calm. "Until you divorce Dad and let Sarah be my real mom."

###Chapter 4: Life Is a Bitch

Annie's POV

Morning sunlight filtered through the hospital room's blinds,casting thin golden lines across the starched white sheets. The steady drip of the IV marked time like a metronome as I struggled to process Philip's words.
"Pregnant?" The word felt foreign on my tongue. "That's your good news?"

Philip nodded, his perfectly pressed suit at odds with the institutional sterility of the hospital room. He pulled an ultrasound image from his breast pocket. "The gynecologist called yesterday while you were...indisposed. The hospital ran tests when you collapsed. We're going to have another baby,Annie."

I stared at the grainy black and white image, trying to reconcile this unexpected spark of life with the chaos of the past twenty-four hours. My fingers trembled as they traced the tiny form. Another child. Another chance.


Memories of my own childhood flooded back - lonely dinners with mom,the empty chair at school events, the constant ache of absence.The thought of this new baby never knowing a complete family...

"I guess we could move on," I whispered, my hand instinctively moving to my still-flat stomach. "For Brian, and for this baby." Philip's expression softened into something that might have been genuine remorse. "Maybe... I mean, of course. I promise things will be different."He reached for my hand, and this time I didn't pull away. "I'll change." The morning light caught something glinting in his other hand-a small jewelry box, "And I got you something," he said, opening it to reveal a pair of delicate lily-shaped earrings. They were beautiful, if surprisingly modest for Philip's usual taste.

"They're perfect," I lied, forcing a smile as he fastened them to my ears.The cool metal felt like shackles.

"I'm glad you like it but I have to go, you know-an emergency board meeting." He kissed my forehead, already reaching for his phone. "Get some rest."

Alone in the hospital room, I let my hand rest on my abdomen, imagining the tiny life growing there. A fresh start. A reason to try again. Right?

\---

The cheerful ping of my phone shattered the fragile peace I'd constructed.A WhatsApp message from Brian. My heart leaped, hoping for reconciliation. "Meet me in the emergency stairwell. I want to talk."

I stared at those words, my thumb hovering over the screen. After everything that had happened - the police station, his threat about self-harm and his act before the teacher. The memory of his cold eyes watching me collapse made my hands shake.

But maybe he was manipulated by Sarah. I could still talk sense into him. And yet... this was my son. My little boy who used to crawl into my bed during thunderstorms. Who would beg me to check under his bed for monsters, then insist on checking under mine too, "just to keep you safe,Mommy." When had that sweet child become this stranger? Hope and dread warred in my chest as I disconnected the IV and made my way into the corridor. The hospital's antiseptic smell burned my nostrils.

Turning left down the corridor, I caught sight of an imposing figure standing ramrod straight before a bench. A man with strong build cut an impressive figure, a father I would say but a young one. Following his gaze, I glanced at the small blonde girl sitting on the bench, her head bowed,eyes fixed on the floor.

As I hurried past them, I caught the pleasant blend of tobacco and cologne.
The scent cleared my head momentarily, I could die sniffing it,but I had no time to dwell on it as I made my way toward the stairwell.

"Lucy,life is a bitch, but you need to learn to love yourself," The man's gentle voice carried through the corridor. He quickly added, "Pardon my language. But you know what I mean,don't you?"

I couldn't help but turn back. His voice was so magnetic and absorbing.I wondered what kind of handsome face could match that manly voice. As I beheld his side of face, I found a vision of rugged handsomeness,his features perfectly chiseled. I followed his gaze and saw Lucy's small face a mask of isolation that startled me. Why?


If I'd had a father tocomfort me like that, I would have given him my brightest smile.


But who knows? Life is a bitch indeed. Maybe I could find time to love myself as well after my conversation with Brian. Squaring my shoulders, I reached for the stairwell door. Brian might be confused, manipulated, even angry, but he was still my son. And sometimes loving yourself meant having the courage to face the hard conversations, no matter how much they might hurt. Pushing open the door to the stairwell, I stepped forward and saw Brian standing ominously on the steps.




The emergency stairwell was bathed in harsh white light,the smell of disinfectant even stronger here and it was mixed with something I couldn't tell. Brian stood halfway up the first flight, his expression unreadable.

"Mom," he said, the word falling like a stone. "Sarah told me to tell you something."

My heart clenched as I forced a smile. "Yes? Sweetie?"

"She said to tell you that you're not wanted anymore. That you should just go away and let her be my real mom." His voice was eerily calm and mechanical as if he were reciting an article from his textbook. "She said you're too weak to fight for us anyway."


I took a step forward, my shoe sliding unexpectedly on the stairs.Looking down, I saw an oily sheen coating the white tiles.

"Brian,wait-"


But he was already turning away, his small shoulders squared with purpose. My foot slipped again, and this time there was nothing to grab onto. The world tilted sickeningly.


My last conscious thought was of the baby - No, don't. Don't leave me,please. This innocent life, my final thread of hope in a tapestry of betrayal,slipping away on these cold tiles. Was this what I deserved for trying so hard to be a good mother?

As I fell to the ground, I let out a piercing scream and clutched my
stomach in agony. I saw a pool of blood spreading on the floor.

The fluorescent lights blurred above me, their harsh glare a fitting witness to my failure. As darkness crept in at the edges of my vision. I thought of the man in the hallway's words to his niece: "Life is a bitch." How right he was!


The world faded to black, leaving me alone with the echo of my son's footsteps walking away from his mother. I'd start to love myself if I couald
###Chapter 5:A Job

Annie's POV

"The baby didn't make it."

Philip's words hung in the sterile hospital air. I kept my eyes fixed on the privacy curtain, refusing to acknowledge his carefully neutral expression or the way his CEO persona never wavered, even now.

"Annie?" His voice carried that familiar note of authority—the tone that expected an immediate response. But I remained silent, letting the steady beep of the heart monitor fill the space between us.

The door burst open, and Brian rushed in, his face pale and drawn. "Mom!" His voice cracked. "Mom, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to—I wasn't trying to—"

I watched him struggle with his words, noted how his apparent distress never quite reached his eyes. The memory of the fall just hours ago flashed through my mind: the oily sheen on the stairs, his retreating back, the calculated nature of it all.

"I didn't know about the baby," he continued, voice rising hysterically. "I swear I didn't mean for you to—"

"Brian." Philip's sharp tone cut through our son's rambling. "Perhaps this isn't the best time."

But the memories were already flooding back—the cold tiles against my skin, the sudden realization of loss, the knowledge even then that I was losing something precious. Something that represented my last hope for this family. I closed my eyes, suddenly exhausted beyond words. When I opened them again, I found Brian staring at me with an expression that shifted between guilt and something harder to define.

"It's okay," I said finally, my voice surprisingly steady. "You can stop pretending now."

Brian's facade cracked, guilt giving way to defiance. "I'm not pretending! I really am—"

"Sorry?" I finished for him. "No, you're not. And that's okay." The words felt strange on my tongue, but they carried a weight of truth I couldn't deny anymore. "You don't have to pretend to love me anymore, Brian."

His eyes widened, then narrowed. The transformation was remarkable—like watching a mask slip away to reveal the stranger beneath. "I don't," he said, his voice suddenly cold and clear. "I don't want you to be my mom anymore. I want Sarah."

Philip shifted uncomfortably beside me, but remained silent. Always calculating the most advantageous position.

"I know," I said quietly. "And from today, you don't have to worry about that anymore. I'm giving the position to Sarah."

The joy that lit up my son's face felt like a physical blow, but I forced myself to meet his eyes. To memorize this moment, this feeling. "Really?" Brian's voice trembled with excitement now, not distress. "You mean it?"

"I do." I turned to Philip. "We should start discussing divorce arrangements soon." Philip's mask slipped for just a moment, surprise flickering across his features before the composed CEO persona reasserted itself. "If you prefer that way, I can't see how I can change your mind."

Brian was practically bouncing now, all pretense of remorse forgotten. "Can I go call Sarah? Can I tell her?"

"Go ahead," Philip said softly, and our son practically ran from the room.

The silence that followed felt heavier than before, weighted with the death of something that had been dying for longer than I'd wanted to admit. Around eleven-thirty, a knock at my door pulled me from my daze.

I found myself looking up at a man I vaguely remembered from this morning's corridor. He introduced himself as Howard Thompson.

Howard stood with a natural, commanding presence that seemed to fill the room. His features were sharp and professional, his attire perfectly tailored, reflecting a man of significant status and discipline. There was a steady, reliable strength in his posture that made the chaotic atmosphere of the hospital feel suddenly grounded. 

Behind him stood a small blonde girl, her eyes fixed on the floor.

"This is Lucy," he continued, gesturing to the silent child beside him. "My niece."

Howard explained that Lucy had suffered a great loss and hadn't spoken for a long time—until she saw me. He offered me a job: working with Lucy, helping her find her voice again. 

I looked between them—the silent child and the man who offered a path out of my wreckage. "I'll need time to think about it," I said finally.

"Of course. Take all the time you need." Howard nodded, his expression professional yet filled with a quiet, underlying kindness.
###Chapter 6: Drugged

Annie's POV

The apartment felt different when I returned from the hospital. Howard's business card was still in my pocket, his job offer and Lucy's silent plea lingering in my thoughts. But all ideas of fresh starts vanished the moment I stepped inside.

Laughter drifted from the dining room—the kind that's practiced until perfect. I found them gathered around the table: Philip at the head, Sarah in my usual seat, and the boys on either side of her. She was opening gifts, her makeup artfully done to project warmth and vulnerability. She was a beauty for sure, but with flaws that men like Philip seemed blind to. Her smile was a masterpiece of calculation, and I wondered how many hours she'd spent perfecting it.

"I'm so glad to join this family," Sarah was saying, her voice trembling with practiced emotion.

Philip noticed me first. "Annie. Join us? We're celebrating."

"Celebrating?" The word tasted bitter. "My miscarriage, perhaps?"

Sarah's hand flew to her throat. "Oh, Annie, I had no idea... I'm so sorry for your loss."

"This is our celebration," Brian declared, glaring at me, "You're not invited." I took a step toward my son, but he jumped up, positioning himself between me and Sarah. "You can't come near my new mom!" "Brian," Philip's voice carried that familiar note of authority. "Could you make do with the guest room?"

"The guest room?" I gasped.

"Mom's staying in your old room now," Brian announced triumphantly. "You can't go in there anymore."

I moved toward the master bedroom, but Brian darted ahead, blocking the doorway. "This is Sarah's room now! You don't belong here anymore!"

"Please, Annie. Don't make it difficult for us all," Philip said firmly, his tone making it clear it wasn't really a plea.

Sarah rose gracefully. "I could stay in the guest room instead," she offered, voice dripping with false modesty. "I wouldn't want to impose..."

"No!" Brian clutched her hand. "You're staying here with us!"

I looked between them—my husband, my son, and the woman who had so expertly orchestrated their devotion.

"Brian, I promised to divorce your dad and that's all you'll receive from me. But this one isn't the promise I made." My voice was steadier than I felt.

I shoved Brian aside, forged into my room, and locked the door. I could use some sleep.

Morning sunlight streamed through the guest room window as I methodically packed my belongings. Each item I placed in my suitcase felt like shedding another layer of the life I'd built here.

My hand brushed against something in the dresser drawer—a phone I didn't recognize. Sarah's, I realized, my heart quickening. She must have left it when she'd moved her things. The screen lit up at my touch, unlocked. She must've been careless.

A notification banner caught my eye: "Lab Results Available—Mount Sinai OB/GYN."

My hands trembled as I opened the message. The words swam before my eyes: "Pregnancy confirmed—9 weeks." The date stamp was from three weeks ago.

Nine weeks. The timeline spun in my head as I opened her WhatsApp. A conversation with "Rob" filled the screen.

Robert: "What do you mean you're pregnant?" Sarah: "Don't worry. Everything's going according to plan." Robert: "Our weekend in Paris..." Sarah: "Exactly. Philip hasn't touched me. This baby is yours."

I felt sick. Sarah wasn't just trying to take my place—she was playing both men. I stuffed Sarah's phone into my pocket. Should I show this to Philip? Despite everything, some part of me hesitated. But then I remembered his betrayals.

Before I could decide, the front door slammed. Philip burst into the room, his composure completely shattered.

"Brian's gone," he said. "Robert took him."

The world tilted sideways. "What?"

"Robert, Sarah's ex-husband, kidnapped Brian. He's demanding... Sarah. Says she belongs to him."

"Then go find Sarah," I said, my voice steady despite the fear.

"He's demanding a trade," Philip's voice was frantic. "Sarah for Brian. But Sarah's disappeared. We need... I need you to come with me."

Understanding dawned with horrifying clarity. "No." I turned to leave. "Call the police."

Philip blocked my path, his face contorted with a desperate, dark intensity. "Annie, Brian is your son! You can't just let him die!"

He grabbed my shoulders, his grip bruisingly tight as he shook me. I was already physically exhausted and emotionally drained from the loss of the baby. As I struggled to break free, the overwhelming stress and my weakened state caused the room to spin. Philip didn't let go; instead, he used his strength to force me toward the door, ignoring my cries.

"I have no choice!" Philip shouted, his voice echoing with a terrifying lack of empathy. "If I don't bring someone to him, he'll kill Brian!"

My knees buckled. The world turned grey as my body finally gave in to the trauma and exhaustion. I felt him catch me, but it wasn't out of care—it was the act of a man preparing a sacrifice. The irony struck me as darkness crept in: my "perfect" family had ended with me being traded away to save a son who hated me.
###Chapter 7:Awakening

Annie's POV

The sharp, stinging scent of an unfamiliar environment pulled me from unconsciousness. My head throbbed, a lingering effect of whatever Philip had used to silence me.  Tears welled up as the weight of his final betrayal crashed over me.

Why is it always me? What did I do wrong?

The betrayal by Philip, the coldness of Brian, the loss of my child—it all felt like a mountain of grief. I forced myself to stop crying. You will NOT fall apart here, I told myself. 

I forced my eyes open. I was in what looked like an abandoned studio, filled with old equipment and dust. A man stood across the room, methodically adjusting an old camera. I recognized him from a photo I had seen—he was Robert, Sarah's ex-husband. 

"Brian?" My voice was a whisper. "Where's Brian?"

"He's safe. Sarah picked him up," Robert said, his focus remains on his equipment. He looked disheveled but focused. "You're quick-witted. You can figure out why you're here."

I realized then that this was all a calculated play. Sarah knew I had found the messages on her phone. I needed to act. 

I saw my belongings on a small table nearby. My phone, my keys, and Howard Thompson's business card. While Robert was distracted with his camera lens, I shifted my weight, my heart hammering against my ribs.

Through the haze of the sedative, my movements felt sluggish. I waited for him to turn his back. As he reached for a flash unit, my fingers closed around my phone. I managed to slide it behind me just as he looked up.

"What else do you know?" he asked, his voice empty.

With trembling fingers behind my back, I navigated to the contact list. I found the number from the card Howard had given me. I didn't dare look at the screen. I just pressed 'dial', hoping the man who offered me a job could now offer me a lifeline.
###Chapter 8: Divorce

Annie's POV

"Stop!" My voice echoed through the dusty photography studio as my arms were still wrapped around Howard from behind. His fist was already drawn back for another blow, Robert's unconscious form slumped against the wall. "He wasn't going to hurt me!"

Howard's muscles tensed beneath my grip. "But I heard it on the phone.I assumed he was trying to rape you."

"Not all of it, apparently. We talked it through. And it was Philip who drugged and brought me here." I tightened my hold, shaking off my inappropriate thoughts at a time like this. "Robert... he's just another one of Sarah's victims."


Howard turned to face me, a slight confusion on his composed face "Should we call the police?"

"No, he's a nice man. He didn't hurt Brian," I met Howard's gaze steadily.

“How do you know?”

"He took him to the museum. And he loves his son, Max. There's a photo of his son on the table. What's more, if he'd really meant harm, I would have called the police, not you."

A shadow crossed Howard's face. He seemed a bit disappointed.

Howard let go of Robert. "That's very smart of you." He said to me, his controlled voice softening as he turned to face me. Our eyes met,and something shifted in the dusty air between us. The blend of tobacco and cologne that I'd noticed earlier wrapped around me again, steadying my nerves even as it made my heart flutter unexpectedly.

"I'm not smart," I jolted out of my trance. "but I am amother."The words caught in my throat. "I was..."

"You can still be if you want." Howard interrupted firmly.




Howard had dropped me at the apartment that used to be my home.

It felt hollow when I entered. Gladly, I found no one at home. Maybe they were in some fancy restaurant, celebrating their victory.

Divorce papers I saw waited on the dining table like a tombstone marking the death of my marriage. Of course Philip would want to get rid of me so quickly, right after what he thought I would've been through.

My belongings sat packed by the door, a life reduced to a few boxes and bags.


I signed the papers without hesitation, my pen moving swiftly across the dotted line. Each signature felt like breaking another chain,setting me free from a life built on lies.

As I gathered the last of my things, I took one final look around. This place had never truly been home - I saw that clearly now. It had been a stage for Philip's performance, a cage gilded with luxury but empty of love. I wanted nothing to do with this family, with that man. Supposedly, I wouldn't sue him for what he had done. And the evidence would be hard to gather anyway. I just wanted to get rid of this place as soon as possible. I turned off the lights and strode downstairs where Howard was waiting for me, each step steadier than the last.

As I got in the car, he said firmly, "I think we need a talk." His voice carried that distinctive controlled warmth I was beginning to recognize.

I nodded, heart pounding in my chest. "Okay."

"I heard everything on the phone. Your conversation with Robert and...about what has befallen you."

My mind raced with questions I didn't dare ask. What did he really think of me? A divorced mother, someone else's castoff, damaged goods with more baggage than any sensible man would want to deal with.

I snuck a glance at his profile, then immediately looked away, scolding myself for the way my heart skipped. Why should his opinion matter so much? I'd only met him a handful of times. And yet... The thought of him pitying me, or worse, regretting his offer to help with Lucy, made my stomach twist.


I caught myself mid-thought and almost laughed at the absurdity. Howard turned to me, his gaze sincere despite the shadow of restraint that seemed to follow him everywhere. "I mean, I don't mind your past.What impressed me was your composure today-staying calm in crisis,using wisdom to defuse it." He paused, something gentler entering his voice. "And your compassion in  forgiving Robert... that shows remarkable strength." The air in the car grew warmer. Howard took a deepbreath,and when he spoke again, his voice caried a note of hope that made my heart skip. "So I'd like ask you to move in, to be Lucy's mother. What do you say?" I dissolved into a hearty smile. "I'm in."




Howard's Long Island mansion was everything my former home wasn't-spacious yet warm, modern yet inviting. And Lucy's bedroom was a fairy-tale dream, all soft colors and gentle light.

"Lucy," I said softly, kneeling beside her bed. "I know things are hard right now. But if you'd let me, I'dlike to stay and take care of you."

She remained silent, her eyes fixed on the pastel butterflies dancing across her bedspread. My heart sank a little, though I'd expected as much. I stood slowly, smoothing my skirt.

"Well, I'll just-"

A small hand shot out, catching mine. Lucy's fingers were impossibly delicate, yet they held on with surprising strength. When I looked back,she gave a tiny, decisive nod.


My throat tightened as I settled back beside her bed. "Would you like me to stay until you fall asleep?"

Another small nod. I began humming softly, an old lullaby my mother used to sing. Lucy's grip gradually relaxed as her breathing deepened into sleep, though her fingers remained loosely twined with mine. As I carefully extracted my hand, that now-familiar blend of tobacco and cologne wrapped around me. I turned to find Howard in the doorway, his broad shoulders filling the frame. The warm light from the hallway caught his profile, highlighting the controlled set of his jaw that contrasted so sharply with his sunny features. "She needs time," Howard said quietly, his voice carrying that measured warmth that made my heart skip. "But that's more than she's done with anyone else."


I watched Lucy's peaceful sleeping form, questions swirling in my mind. "Do you know why?" I finally asked. "Why she specifically wanted me to..."I trailed off, still uncertain how to phrase my role in this arrangement.

Howard shifted in the doorway, his elegant fingers drumming absently against the frame. The hallway light caught in his carefully trimmed beard,and I found myself noticing how the shadows played across his features.

No, Annie. This was not the time.


"I wish I knew," he said softly. "She barely speaks - hasn't really,since..."He exhaled slowly. "If she would just talk to us, everything would be so much simpler."


Another waft of his cologne - that intoxicating blend of tobacco and something warmer - made my pulse quicken. I needed to focus,to break this charged moment before I did something foolish.

"Howard," I said, fighting to keep my voice steady. "I have an idea."
###Chapter 9: A White Lie

Lucy's POV

I woke up when the sun was playing peek-a-boo with my curtains.Something smelled yummy downstairs - Annie was making breakfast! All our helpers had a day off today, so it had to be Annie in the kitchen. She was the only grown-up who could make pancakes smell this good!

I jumped out of bed and ran to my window. The grass looked all sparkly in the morning sun. Our big house felt different now that Annie was here.Better. The other ladies who took care of me always left quick, but Annie felt...special.

I wanted to say good morning to her so bad. The words were in my head,but they got stuck in my throat, like they always did since Mommy and Daddy went away. The doctor said there was a reason I couldn't talk, but I just knew it felt like my words were locked up tight.

"Lucy? Time to wake up,sweetheart!"

Annie came to my door in her pretty blue dress. Her smile wasn't fake like other grown-ups. It was real and warm, like Mommy's used to be.

"Ready for school?"

I nodded and sat at my mirror. Annie was super gentle when she brushed my hair- not pulling at all! In the mirror, I watched her make silly faces while she concentrated. "Let's make your hair extra pretty today!" She started doing twisty braids. "We should get you some new hair ties soon. These old ones are getting tired." The way she did my braids reminded me of Mommy. My chest got tight thinking about that, so I wwatched Annie instead. She made the whole house feel less empty. Even Uncle Howard's serious face got softer when she was around.


"All done!" Annie finished my braids. She turned to get something from her bag.

This was my chance! I slipped down from the chair super quiet, like a ninja. Annie was still looking in her bag when I tip-toed out.

I knew exactly where to go. Yesterday, when Annie was unpacking, I saw her hang up a pretty blue dress in her room. It looked just like the one she was wearing today!

When Annie came looking for me, I was standing in her room pointing at her dress, then at myself. This was howv I talked - not with words, but with showing things.

Annie's eyes got all sparkly when she understood. "You want us to match?



I nodded so hard my new braids bounced everywhere.

"That's perfect!"

Soon I was twirling in my own blue dress just like Annie's. She watched me spin with that special mommy look that made my heart feel warm and fuzzy. I showed her my biggest, happiest smile ad a extra twirl in my matching dress. She and Uncle Howard could make a perfect couple, it hit me. Morning at school was always the same. Uncle Howard would drop me off early,his goodbye smile carrying that hint of worry I pretended not to notice. My Teachers would greet me with her gentle "Good morning,Lucy,"not expecting an answer anymore.

I liked being early. The classroom was quiet then, peaceful.I could arrange my colored pencils in rainbow order, each one perfectly straight.

During circle time, I sat in my usual spot by the window, where I could watch the leaves dance in the breeze. We sang our morning songs-I moved my lips without sound, but my fingers tapped the rhythm on my knees. When my teacher read us "The Very Hungry Caterpillar," I traced the butterfly patterns I'd memorized on my palm.

But then came art time, and everything changed.

Something was wrong with Brian. Really wrong.

I watched from my corner as he pressed his red crayon into the paper. His hand moved back and forth, back and forth, angry lines getting darker until the paper tore. It wasn't like before, when he'd draw perfect green dinosaurs and show everyone how to make the spikes just right. I knew he learned it from his mother, my Annie. I felt sad that he changed. He was good at painting. "Careful with the materials, Brian," My art teacher said softly. But Brian just grabbed another crayon, his face all scrunched up like he was trying not to cry. At recess, Brian stood alone by the slide. Tommy tried to play with him,like he used to, but Brian shoved him hard into the sandbox. As Tommy started crying, I saw Brian's hands shake - just like mine do when the memories get too big and the words get stuck.

"He's mean now," Emma whispered to Jenny. "Since his mommy went away. But I thought he wanted it."

I looked down at my drawing-a family of butterflies, free and together.Carefully, I folded it and put it in my pocket. Maybe I could show it to Uncle Howard and Annie later. If they could just be together,then I could have mom and dad again.




Uncle Howard picked me up from school today. He was talking on his phone about boring grown-up stuff the whole way home, quite unusual but I didn't know why. I was excited to see Annie! She always waits by the door with my favorite apple slices and that special warm smile that makes my whole day better.

But when we got home, Annie wasn't there.

Annie, I said out loud though only I could hear. I peeked into the living room, my heart doing happy little jumps. Maybe she was hiding! She likes to play games with me sometimes.

I tiptoed to check behind the big armchair where we read stories. Not there!I giggled,feeling like a detective on a mission, Next, I looked in the sunroom where we watch birds together. She wasn't there either,but I saw a pretty red cardinal that made me wish Annie was there to see it too.I checked my bedroom, then the art room where she loved to do her painting. With each empty room, my excitement grew bigger. Annie must be planning something really special! Uncle Howard went straight to his office for more phone calls.Grown-ups are so boring sometimes! But that was okay-I had an important mission!

I ran up the stairs, checking every room. My legs were getting tired, but I didn't care. Finding Annie was like a treasure hunt, and she was the best treasure ever!


Then I reached the kitchen.

My heart stopped doing its happy dance.

Annie was lying on the floor, her face white as the snow we made angels in last winter. Just like Mommy and Daddy looked before the real angels came for them.


My legs got all wobbly. I knelt beside her and touched her arm really gentle.


She didn't move.

I shook her arm a tiny bit harder.

Nothing.

My eyes got all hot and blurry. No, no, no! Not like Mommy and Daddy! I can't lose another mommy!But then I remembered what my teacher at school says: when scary things happen, take a big breath and think about what to do. So I did. Annie needed help. And Uncle Howard could help! I ran to his office so fast my socks slipped on the floor. He was still on his phone, talking about numbers and meetings and other boring things. I pulled his sleeve, but he did that annoying grown-up "one minute" 
finger wiggle.

I pulled harder, but he just turned away. Why? He was so different today after my school. He usually gave his time whenever I needed. What is happening?

Annie needed help NOW!

My chest felt like it would explode. I saw Annie's white face in my mind,and suddenly all the words that had been stuck inside me for so long came rushing out like a tidal wave.

"Mom's on the kitchen floor!"

Uncle Howard's phone crashed to the ground just like last time in the hospital.

"Lucy?"

Annie was standing in the doorway! Her face wasn't white anymore-it was pink and pretty. She recovered so soon and it was so strange.

"Did you just call mne Mom?"
###Chapter 10: The Weight of Expectations (Howard's POV)
The morning light hadn't yet breached the horizon when I found myself awake, earlier than usual. The merger negotiations ahead demanded preparation, yet my mind refused to focus on the financial projections waiting in my briefcase.

I gathered my papers and headed toward the dining room for breakfast. My footsteps echoed in the quiet hallway, each one carefully measured until—without conscious thought—I found myself slowing outside Annie's door.

The familiar scent of lilacs stopped me completely. It drifted through the small gap beneath her door, the same gentle fragrance that had caught my attention that day in the photography studio. Suddenly, I was back there: feeling the brief, accidental proximity of her presence, her voice steady and calm as she handled the crisis with such grace.

"He's a nice man." She had made such a quick and accurate judgment, which saved both her and a poor man’s life.

But why did I drop everything to save her that day? I had only met her twice, and it turned out she was more than capable of handling herself. Now, I was forced to work twice as hard this entire week to keep the merger on track.

It was for Lucy, I told myself firmly. My niece needed stability, needed someone who could help her find her voice again. That’s all it was.

But even as I formed the thought, I knew it wasn't the complete truth. Something about Annie’s presence in our home had shifted the very air we breathed. The way she smiled at Lucy and at me, the way she pored over selective mutism treatment books late into the night, her quiet determination to help... I’d catch glimpses of her from my study, bent over medical texts or sketching thoughtfully, and something in my chest would tighten inexplicably.

Standing at my bedroom window, I watched the sun begin to paint the manicured grounds in shades of gold. When was the last time I’d truly been present for Lucy’s bedtime? The merger negotiations had been consuming my days and nights. The guilt settled heavy in my stomach, mixing uncomfortably with thoughts of Annie’s gentle way with Lucy—how naturally she’d stepped into the role I’d been struggling to fill alone.

"Mr. Thompson?" Maria's voice startled me from my reverie. "Your coffee, sir."

I caught the housekeepers exchanging glances at my appearance—the same suit from yesterday, my usually immaculate presence showing signs of strain. Their whispered concerns drifted through the halls: "Never seen him like this before... working too hard... not even changed..."

The mirror confirmed their observations. Dark circles shadowed my eyes, and my hands trembled slightly as I adjusted my tie. The CEO of Howard Technologies couldn't afford to show weakness, especially not today. But the face staring back at me looked more human than I’d allowed myself to appear in years.

The gleaming headquarters of Howard Technologies rose like a monument. Employees nodded respectfully as I passed, their whispered conversations carrying notes of admiration.

"Following in his father's footsteps..."

Alone in my office, I let the mask slip slightly. My father’s words echoed in my mind: "A Thompson carries the weight of generations. Personal desires are secondary to family legacy." I’d lived by those words since inheriting his position. Every decision calculated, every move strategic.

Until Annie.

The thought of her sent an uncomfortable ripple through my carefully maintained control. There was nothing strategic about the way my pulse quickened when she was near, nothing calculated about the warmth that spread through my chest when I saw her with Lucy.

The intercom buzzed, interrupting my train of thought. "Your mother on line one, sir."

I suppressed a sigh. "Put her through."

"Howard, darling." My mother, Margaret Thompson's voice carried its usual blend of authority and social refinement. "I’ve arranged lunch with Catherine Morgan next week. Her family’s influence could be quite beneficial."

"Mother, we’ve discussed this." I pinched the bridge of my nose. "I’m focused on Lucy right now."

"About that." Her tone sharpened. "The board has expressed concerns about your ability to balance CEO responsibilities with single parenthood. Perhaps it’s time to consider more... traditional arrangements for Lucy's care."

Ice spread through my veins. "Lucy stays with me."

"Don’t be difficult, Howard. A child needs a proper family structure. You know the court would agree that a grandmother’s care might be more appropriate than a busy CEO’s..."

The implied threat made my jaw clench. I drew a slow breath, forcing myself to respond diplomatically. "I’ll consider your concerns, Mother. But I have a meeting starting now."

"Consider carefully, Howard. Think of what's best for Lucy."

I ended the call, my fingers white-knuckled around the phone. Mother had always wielded Lucy’s wellbeing like a weapon. My eyes strayed to the family photo on my desk—Lucy’s silent smile, forever frozen in happier times. The weight of being both CEO and father pressed down on my shoulders.

The afternoon dragged interminably. Project delays mounted, pressure from the board increased, and I found myself adjusting my tie for the third time in an hour—a nervous tell I thought I'd eliminated years ago.

My phone buzzed with a message from Annie: "Will you join us for dinner tonight? I want to discuss something."

The simple text shouldn't have sent such a jolt through my system. I stared at the words, mind racing. Lucy had been different lately—more responsive, almost speaking at times, but only to Annie. Was that what Annie wanted to discuss? Or was there something else?

I realized I was smiling at my phone like a teenager and quickly schooled my expression. What was happening to me? I was Howard Thompson, CEO of a tech empire, known for my unshakeable control. I didn’t get flustered by text messages.

Yet here I was, checking the time again, willing the hands to move faster so I could return home. Return to that soothing, subtle scent of lilacs.

The thought stopped me cold. When had "home" started meaning more than just the place where Lucy waited? When had Annie’s presence become something I looked forward to with such... anticipation?

Focus, I commanded myself. The merger documents demanded attention.

Everyone was watching—the housekeepers, the employees, my mother, Lucy, and Annie. I was supposed to maintain my composure, to make this project work, and to live up to the Thompson name. I needed to secure Lucy's future... and perhaps, find a place in that future for the woman who was slowly changing everything
###Chapter 11: Longing

Annie's POV

It was another day of sun. How lovely the morning was after whatever had happened these days. I thought as I made my way toward Lucy's room. A week of late nights researching selective mutism treatments had left me exhausted, but Lucy's progress made every bleary-eyed morning worth it.


As I passed Howard's bedroom, I noticed a warm glow beneath the door-the same gentle light I'd seen from his study last night as he worked late again. The familiar scent of his morning coffee was notably absent, and something in my chest tightened at the realization.

"A week now," I murmured to myself, the words barely a whisper."Always leaving early, coming home lae..." I caught myself and shook my head. What right did I have to mniss his presence? I was here for Lucy,nothing more.

"Mr. Thompson left for the office at five this morning, ma'am,"Maria informed me as I passed the kitchen. "Another early meeting."

I nodded, ignoring the small pang of disappointment. Focus on Lucy,I reminded myself. She needed consistency, routine, care - not a guardian distracted by inappropriate feelings for her uncle. Lucy's room was awashin morning sunshine when I entered. She sat at her vanity, already dressed in her school uniform, waiting patiently for our morning ritual. I gathered her golden hair in my hands, marveling at how this simple act of braiding had become something sacred between us. "How about a French braid today?" I suggested, meeting her eyes in the mirror. Her answering smile lit up her face, and then she spoke softly: "Can we do the special braid like yesterday?"

"Of course,sweetheart," I said, my voice thick with emotion. JuIst a week ago, she wouldn't have spoken at all. This small request, this tiny step forward, meant everything.




After sending Lucy to school, the mansion felt cavernous. I tried to lose myself in my usual routine - dividing time between studying selective mutism treatment books and sketching in my notebook.

Drawing had been my escape even before the divorce, a way to connect with Brian through art. Now, alone in the sunny study, my pencil moved almost unconsciously across the paper, capturing memories of teaching him how to draw his beloved dinosaurs.

I paused, studying the half-finished sketch. Without Brian, even art felt different. More solitary. And lately I'd found myself drawn to new subjects - Lucy's delicate profile as she watched birds through the window, the way sunlight played across the mansion's elegant architecture. My fingers itched to capture the quiet strength in Howard's bearing,how his controlled demeanor contrasted with his warm eyes... I quickly closed my sketchbook, cheeks warming. He has more important things to worry about than my amateur drawings, I scolded myself. Still, I couldn't help but notice how the study felt colder without his presence,how the halls echoed a little too loudly with just Lucy and me to fill them. My eyes drifted back to the selective mutism texts spread across the desk.Somewhere in these pages lay the key to helping Lucy find her voice again.If only Howard could see her small but steady progress - the almost- words that sometimes trembled on her lips, the way she was beginning to communicate through art just as I once had with Brian...

Stop it. I told myself firmly. He's working. The last thing he needs is to be bothered with my observations.




The afternoon sun beat down mercilessly on the Upper East Side Private Preschool. As Lucy and I approached the gates, I saw Brian standing near a teacher, his small shoulders set in that stubborn line I knew so well.

"Your father said he's still in a meeting and you mom's in charge of picking you up," The teacher was saying gently. "And your mother..."

"My real mom is coming!" Brian snapped, but I caught the tremor beneath his bravado. "Sarah promised she'd be here!"

Lucy's hand tightened in mine as she sensed the tension.

"She's just running late," Brian continued, his voice rising. "She has to come.She promised!"

"Brian," I said softly, unable to stop myself.

He whirled around, his face flushed. "Why are you here? Picking up Lucy?



The words were meant to wound, but something in his eyes - a flicker of uncertainty,a shadow of fear.


"Yes," I kept my voice steady. "I'm picking up Lucy."

"I don't care!"His shout echoed across the nearly empty schoolyard."You're not my mom anymore. Sarah loves me more than you ever did!" Lucy pressed closer to my side as Brian's voice cracked on the last word.

"T'm sure she's just stuck in traffic," The teacher offered weakly, checking her phone again. "These streets can be unpredictable."

But something felt wrong. Sarah, who had orchestrated every detail of stealing my son, who never missed an opportunity to play the perfect mother- she wasn't here? The Sarah I thought would never waste a chance to showcase her victory, to twist the knife deeper. Her absence felt deliberate.calculated.

Maybe I should take him home, back to his of course.

I watched as he furiously wiped his eyes with his sleeve, determined to hide his tears. The memory of the hospital stairs flashed unbidden through my mind - his cold eyes as I fell, the calculated cruelty of it all.Even knowing Sarah had manipulated him, the wound was still too fresh to ignore.

Lucy's small hand tightened in mine, her silent support grounding me in the present. As we turned to leave, I stole a glance at Brian until we rounded the corner.

I could forgive him, but not now.

After the hiccup, I took Lucy toward the car.

"What's this?" I asked as Lucy tugged my sleeve, pointing a poster in her hands.

"Emma says there's a new theme park near her house,"she said, not very fluently or loudly. Her hopeful eyes met mine in the rearview mirror.

"Would you like to go this weekend? But of course we would need your uncle's approval." Theenthusiastic nodding that followed made me laugh.My heart leaped - this was the most initiative she'd shown yet! Howard would want to know about this. The thought of starting a conversation with him sent an unexpected thrill through me.

This was no news to talk about on the phone. I would tell him in person!

Stop it, I chided myself. He's Lucy's uncle, your employer essentially.These feelings are inappropriate. But as Lucy started planning our weekend adventure, I couldn't help wondering if Howard might join us.The image of him watching Lucy play, that careful mask softening into genuine joy, was almost painfully appealing.

I was so weak.
###Chapter 12: Out of Control

Howard's POV

The merger documents sat neatly stacked on my desk, having endured three rounds of meticulous review. Everything was finally in order. I allowed myself a moment to think of home-of Annie's message about having something to discuss, of Lucy's silent but expressive presence. The corners of my mouth lifted slightly at the thought.

Rapid footsteps in the hallway shattered my momentary peace. My secretary burst through the door, her usually composed demeanor noticeably strained.

"Mr. Thompson, the acquisition team just called."

I raised an eyebrow,waiting.

"There's a significant discrepancy in the valuation model submitted by Wilson's team."


I leaned forward in my chair,maintaining my composure despite the surge of frustration. "Have Wilson's team send over their complete calculation sheets. I'll review them personally."

My secretary nodded, already tapping on her tablet. "They're preparing the files now, sir. Should I push back tomorrow morning's board meeting?"

"No." The word camne out sharper than intended, and I softened my tone."The schedule stays as is. We'll resolve this tonight." The briefcase I'd been reaching for remained untouched as I reopened my laptop. Of course the investment team would make a critical error now,when I'd finally started looking forward to something beyond these glass walls.

While the computer booted up, I reached for my phone. "I won't make it for dinner. But I'll try to get back early." The words came out with my usual restraint, though something in my chest tightened as I sent the message.

The typing indicator appeared, disappeared, then appeared again. Finally:

"Okay, I will put Lucy to bed early."

Such a simple response, yet I could picture her careful smile, the way she'd explain my absence to Lucy.

I set the phone face-down and pulled up the first batch of spreadsheets.Numbers. Calculations. These I understood. These followed rules, made sense, didn't create this uncomfortable warmth in my chest whenever I thought about Lucy and...Annie perhaps.

"Mr. Thompson?" My secretary's voice crackled through the intercom."Your mother's on the phone."

Twice in a day?

"Howard, darling. I've just had the most interesting conversation with Catherine."


I said briefly,"Yes?" "I just found out she may not want to be a mother so soon.Perhaps it would be best if Lucy stayed with me for a while? You're clearly overwhelmed..." "I'm handling a merger." My tone carried a warning edge. "At this hour? This is exactly what concerns me. You have no time for-"

"We'll discuss this later." I ended the call before she could continue.

My grip on the pen tightened until my knuckles whitened. Then slowly relaxed. Control. Always control. I forced my attention back to the Laptop before me, but Mother's words lingered like smoke, mixing toxically with the pressure of the failing merger.

Two hours passed, I was still in the conference room, personally reviewing each correction. Then I saw it - a crucial clause I'd somehow missed in my earlier reviews. The revelation was pounding my chest and for a second. I found it hard to breathe.

Every modification we'd made tonight would need to be recalculated.

I, Howard Thompson, had made a rookie mistake.

The entire night had been wasted.

"We'll continue tomorrow." I announced to my team as I headed for my car.


The mansion was silent when I finally arrived home. No soft scratching of pencils on paper from Lucy's art room. No gentle turning of pages from where Annie usually read. Just empty spaces filled with moonlight and the weight of my failures. The pressure that had been building all day finally cracked my careful control. I yanked open the refrigerator door, grabbed the whiskey and took a long swallow. The liquid burned but did nothing to ease the chaos in my mind. I need another distraction. Anything. Alcohol would not be enough to do it. "Howard?"

Annie's voice cut through the haze. She stood in the doorway, her expression a mix of concern and something deeper.

I crossed the space between us in three strides and pulled her close."Annie..." My voice emerged rough with need. A week of suppressed longing crumbled in her presence.

I kissed her.

She drew in a shaky breath, her chest rising and falling rapidly against mine. "I should go. It's late and-"

"Stay." The word escaped heavy with everything I'd been holding back."Please."


Her body betrayed her hesitation, pressing closer even as she protested."Howard,stop.We can't."

"Why not?" My hands slid to her waist, feeling her shiver at my touch.

"I just got divorced. Lucy needs stability, not... complications." Her hands trembled as she pushed against my chest. "You've been drinking. This isn't-"


"I know exactly what I'm doing." I traced her cheek with my thumb,watching her lean into the caress despite herself. "I've wanted you since that day in the photography studio." Her breath caught. "Think about Lucy. About your company. About-" "I'm tired of thinking." I rested my forehead against hers, breathing in her lilac scent. "For once, I want to feel." Something shifted in her eyes at those words. Her resistance wavered as I pressed her against the wall, one hand tangling in her hair while the other traced down her side. EachI touch drew a soft gasp from her lips.

"Howard..." This time my name was a plea as she arched into me, her body responding even as her mind fought for control. When my mouth found her nec, she moaned, her fingers curling into my shirt.

The sound shattered my restraint. I claimed her lips in a deep kiss,swallowing her whimpers as my hands roamed her body. The silk of her dress did nothingto hide how she trembled beneath my touch. Her skin burned everywhere I caressed, betraying her need even as she weakly protested.


"We shouldn't..." But her legs parted as my thigh pressed between them,her body growing pliant as my fingers traced the lace edge of her underwear. Years of maintaining perfect control dissolved in theface of how desperately she responded to each of my touch.

"I need you," I growled against her throat, feeling her pulse race beneath my lips. The words seemed to break something loose in her. Her hands,which had been pushing me away, now pulled me closer.

"Yes," she breathed, finally surrendering to what we both wanted. I lifted her against me, her legs wrapping around my waist as I carried her upstairs. Each step was exquisite torture with her pressed against me,leaving hot kisses along my jaw. For once, I didn't care about control or appearances or responsibilities.There was only Annie, and the overwhelming need to claim her as mine.
###Chapter 13: A Rude Awakening

Brian's POV

"Your dad isn't answering his phone. He must be in a meeting." my teacher said for the third time, frowning at her cell phone. "And Mrs.Johnson's number, I mean you step mom's number goes straight to voicemail."


I stood by the school gate, trying to look brave even though my stomach felt funny. Sarah promised she'd come. She promised. She said we'd go get ice cream after school,just like she always did before.

"Perhaps we should call your birth mother-" my teacher started.

"She's not my mother anymore!" The words burst out before I could stop them. "I don't want her to comne. She's mean and boring and only cares about stupid food rules!"

My teacher sighed that grown-up sigh that means they think you're being difficult. "Brian, someone needs to pick you up. It's already past four."

"I want to go home." I crossed my arms tight against my chest, like a shield."I can walk."


"You know we can't let you do that." She checked her phone again. "I'll have to escort you home myself." The walk felt longer than usual. My teacher kept trying to talk to me,asking about my day and my friends, but I just stared at my shoes.They were new ones Sarah had bought me -sparkly blue with real lights that blinked when I walked. Annie never let me have light-up shoes. She always said they were a waste of money and would break too quickly.
But Annie also never forgot to pick me up.

Our apartment building looked different somehow when we finally got there. Bigger. Emptier. The doorman nodded to my teacher and called the elevator, but nobody said anything on the rideup.

"Will you be alright by yourself?" my teacher asked when we reached our door. "Is there someone inside?"

"Dad will be home soon," I lied. "And Sarah too. They're just busy."

She didn't look like she believed me, but she finally left after making me promise to call the school if I needed anything. As soon as the door closed behind her, the apartment felt huge and quiet, like a museum after everyone goes home.

I dumped my backpack by the door- something Annie would have never allowed-and headed straight for the kitchen. Sarah had filled our freezer with my favorite ie cream flavors, all the ones Annie said had too much sugar. I grabbed the biggest spoon I could find and started eating right from the container.

That's when I saw Sarah's Instagram post.

"Perfect afternoon with my perfect boy! #BlessedMama #QualityTime"

The photo showed her and Max at the new theme park, the one she'd promised to take me to. They were both smiling, and Max had ice cream all over his face. The time stamp said "1 hour ago,"

My stomach started to hurt, but I couldn't tell if it was from all the ice cream or something else. I scrolled through more photos-Sarah and Max at the movies, at the park, getting fancy lunches. All posted today, while I was at school. While she was supposed to be too busy to pick me up. The ice cream didn't taste good anymore, but I kept eating.Annie would have stopped me by now. She always seemed to know exactly when I'd had too much, even before I did. She'd take away the ice cream and make me drink water, then rub my belly when it hurt.

But Annie wasn't here anymore. Because I'd wanted Sarah instead.

My stomach cramped sharply, making me curl up on the couch.The empty ice cream container fell to the floor, but I couldn't make myself pick it up. Annie would be so disappointed in the mess...

"Brian?" Dad's voice startled me. I hadn't even heard him come in. "What s wrong? Why are you home alone?"

"Sarah was supposed to..." The words got stuck as another cramp hit. "She promised..."


Dad's face did something complicated, like he was trying to figure out a really hard math problem. Then he saw the ice cream container and sighed."Let's get you to the doctor."




The next morning, Sarah was already at our kitchen table when I woke up.She looked perfect as always in her fancy clothes, but something felt different. Her smile didn't reach her eyes anymore.

"Finally awake?" she said, not looking up from her phone. "There's cereal if you're hungry." I stared at the box of sugary cereal on the table. Annie never let me have this kind for breakfast. She said my body needed real food to grow strong and healthy. She'd make me special pancakes instead, the ones that didn't make my stomach hurt. "I don't feel good," I said quietly. "Can I have something else?"

Sarah's perfect eyebrows drew together. "If you don't want cereal,you can go hungry. I'm not your servant."

Max snickered from his seat, his mouth full of colorful cereal. "Mom says only babies need special food."

"But yesterday you said-"

"Things change, Brian." Sarah's voice had an edge I'd never heard before."And if you tell your father about any of this, you'll regret it. Understood?"

I nodded quickly, my throat feeling tight. This wasn't the Sarah I knew.
Where was the one who bought me toys and let me eat whatever I wanted?The one who said she'd be a better mom than Annie?

"Max, honey, ready to go to the new theme park?" Sarah's voice turned sweet again as she turned to her son. "I got us VIP passes!"

"But you promised we'd all go together..." The words slipped out before I could stop them.

Sarah's perfect smile turned sharp. "Plans change. Maybe next time."

I watched them leave,Sarah's designer heels clicking against the floor, Max shooting me a smug look over his shoulder. The apartment felt even bigger and emptier than before.

Sitting alone at the kitchen table, I stared at the soggy cereal turning the milk weird colors. Annie would have never left me alone like this. Even when she was mad at me, she always made sure I ate properly.She'd sit with me and ask about my day, even if I didn't want to talk. The door opened again hours later, and for a second I thought maybe Dad had come home early. But it was Sarah, her perfect makeup not quite hiding how angry she looked.

"You little brat," she hissed, grabbing my arm. "Max got hurt at the park because of your stupid mother!"

"Annie? But she wasn't even-"

The slap caught me by surprise, my cheek stinging as tears sprang to my eyes.


"Your mother got my son beaten up!" Sarah's perfect nails dug into my arm. "Well, if my son has to suffer, so do you!"

I tried to pull away, but she was stronger than she looked. "Please, I didn't-"


"Max!" she called out. "Take Brian's breakfast and throw it away. We can't let Brian's Dad see that."


Max appeared with a mean grin, grabbing my untouched cereal bowl. I watched him dump it in the trash and then take out the trash,remembering all the times Annie had made sure I ate, even when I was being difficult.

"Go to your room," Sarah ordered Max. "And don't come out, no matter what you hear." As Max's door closed, Sarah's face changed. She wasn't even trying to look nice anymore. She looked... scary. "Your father wants us to be a happy family," she said, her voice getting weirdly calm. "But you're making that very difficult, Brian. Very difficult indeed."
###Chapter 14: Daddy

Annie's POV

In the morning, I was painting the living room. I hummed softly as I packed sandwiches into the picnic basket, each movement measured and careful despite the giddy warmth in my chest.

"Mom's in a really good mood today," Lucy's voice came softly from behind me.


I nearly dropped the thermos I was holding. Even after a week, hearing her speak still felt like a small miracle. But this morning, her observation made heat rise to my cheeks as memories from that night a few days ago flooded back...

*Howard's fingers tangled in my hair as he deepened the kiss. The taste of whiskey on his lips should have been a warning, but when he whispered"I need you" against my mouth, all my carefully constructed barriers crumbled. We'd stumbled upstairs, hands exploring, hearts racing...*

"Annie?"

Howard's voice jolted me from my reverie. He stood in the doorway,tablet conspicuously absent for once, wearing casual clothes that made him look years younger. "Ready for our adventure?" I ducked my head, hoping he couldn't read the memories in my eyes.That night, after our passionate encounter, I'd curled against his chest and whispered Lucy's wish to visit the new theme park. He'd promised to take us after his work was simply done. I hadn't expected him to follow through so quickly. "Almost ready!" I called out, packing the last few items. Lucy stood nearby,carefully arranging her backpack, her eyes darting between Howard and me with a knowing smile that made me wonder just how much she'd noticed.


The lingering sweetness from our passionate encounter days ago seemed to hover in the air as we drove to Manhattan, broken only by Lucy's occasional excited comments about the attractions she wanted to try. I caught Howard watching me in the rearview mirror more than once, his controlledexpression softening whenever our eyes met.




The theme park buzzed with weekend energy. Lucy's eyes grew wide at the sight of the carousel, its painted horses gleaming in the midday sun.

"Would you like to try it?" Howard asked gently.

Lucy nodded eagerly, and we joined the line. I watched in wonder as she perched atop a golden horse, Howard standing protectively beside her. His hand brushed mine as we both reachedto steady her,sending electricity skittering across my skin.

The picnic that followed felt like a scene from someone else's life-Lucy actually giggling as she bit into her sandwich, Howard's usual CEO persona nowhere in sight as he stretched out on the blanket beside us. For a moment, we were just a normal family enjoying a sunny day.

But the peace shattered shortly after Lucy's second carousel ride.

I noticed the change immediately - her shoulders hunched, her earlier joy evaporating. Howard tensed beside me, his protective instincts kicking in.

"Sweetheart?" I knelt beside her. "Don't you want to play anymore?" She shook her head, making the writing motion we'd developed. I pulled out the small notebook I always carried now. Her hands trembled slightly as she wrote:


"Max said I'm a mute freak. Said Mom isn't good enough for our family.His mom says you are just after Uncle Howard's money."

My heart clenched, but years of teaching experience took over. "Max needs to apologize for those unkind words."

Sarah sauntered forward with Max sulking behind her, her red lips curved in a smile that didn't reach her eyes. She gave Howard's impeccable appearance an appreciative once-over before turning to me with barely concealed disdain.

"Apologize?" She laughed, the sound like wind chimes with razor edges."Oh Annie, I'm just pointing out what everyone can see." Her gaze swept over my simple dress before returning to Howard. "Some of us understand the finer things in life.. and some of us are clearly out of our depth.Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Clearly-Somebodly?”

The words hit deeper than I wanted to admit. She was right - I didn't belong in their privileged sphere. What was I thinking, imagining I could... "Excuse me." Howard's voice cut through my spiral of doubt. He stepped forward, placing himself between us. His voice carried that familiar CEO authority that could make board members squirm in their seats. "You have a sharp eye. So you should know what would happen if you and your son don't apologize to my family." The color drained from Sarah's perfectly made-up face. Her eyes darted around frantically, probably counting how many witnesses were within earshot. Howard's subtle reminder clearly hit its mark. "I... I didn't mean..." she stammered, her earlier confidenceevaporating.Then,switching tactics with desperate efficiency, she turned to Max. "Sweetheart,that wasn't nice. You need to apologize right now." When Max just crossed his arms defiantly, panic flashed across her face. "Max!" She shoved him forward, her careful poise completely shattered. "Apologize.Now!"


When he just glared sullenly, she did something I never expected - her hand whipped out,catching him across the face. "I said apologize!"

"S-sorry," Max mumbled, tears welling in his eyes.

Right after that, Sarah dragged him away, leaving us in stunned silence.Lucy's small hand found mine, squeezing tight.

She was quite fluctuating. Yet she was pregnant. Maybe that could explain it. Pregnant women could be unpredictable. Or she was just jealous.

"Don't let her words bother you," Howard murmured, his arm sliding around my shoulders. The warmth of his touch steadied me, even as my heart raced at his closeness.




That evening, Lucy surprised me by asking if we could sleep together.As we lay in her bed, her small body curled trustingly against mine. I felt a surge of maternal warmth. She held onto me tightly, as if afraid I might disappear. Lucy curled against me, her small head tucked under my chin. As I stroked her hair, the tender moment brought a fleeting memory of Brian,but it didn't hurt as much anymore. Lucy's warmth and steady breathing had become its own kind of comfort, especially tonight when she'd asked to sleep beside me.

"Lucy, sweetheart?" I whispered, my fingers still gentle in her hair. She stirred against me, tilting her face up to meet my gaze. Those clear eyes blinked up at me, filled with trust.

"Would it be okay..." I began softly, careful not to disturb the delicate peace between us, "if I asked you something?"

She nodded.

"First, why did you choose me? What made you want me to stay?"

Lucy was quiet for a moment, then spoke softly: "I saw Brian's drawings at school. They were better than everyone else's. He said you taught him."She paused. then added, "I thought you maust be good at drawing. Like my mommy was."

My heart constricted at her words. Such a simple reason, yet it carried so much meaning.

"For my second question..." I hesitated, "Would you try talking to Howard?Just a little?"

She nodded again and slipped out of bed. I followed as she padded down the hallway to Howard's study. He sat at his desk, reading through documents, but looked up as we appeared in the doorway. When we entered, his eyes were suspiciously bright as he gathered Lucy into his arms. "Daddy" What? Did she know something?
###Chapter 15: She's My Girlfriend

Annie's POV

The morning sun painted the mansion's kitchen in shades of gold as I prepared breakfast alone, the usual staff having the day off. The familiar scent of coffee filled the air, but my hands trembled slightly as I measured out the grounds. This morning felt different.

Keep it professional, I reminded myself for the hundredth time. Lucy needed stability, not complications. But even as I arranged her breakfast with meticulous care, my mind wandered to the warmth of Howard's embrace, the tenderness in his eyes when he'd whispered my name...

No.Focus.

Lucy bounded into the kitchen, her golden hair catching the sunlight."Morning, Mom!" The word still made my heart skip, even as guilt gnawed at me. What right did I have to let her call me that when I was jeopardizing her stability with my inappropriate feelings for her uncle? He was way out of my league. Sarah was right. I was just nobody.

"Morning!" Howard appeared moments later, impeccable as always in his perfectly tailored suit. Our eyes met briefly before I looked away,busying myself with Lucy's lunch. The weight of his gaze lingered, carrying all the unspoken words between us.

"Morning,Daddy!" Lucy's innocent words struck me hard. I nearly dropped the coffee pot,my hands suddenly unsteady. The domesticity of the scene - Lucy's happy greeting, Howard's warm presence, the golden morning light streaming through the windows -it all felt simultaneously perfect and terrifying. I was desperately trying to ignore how natural this felt. How right. But beneath that warmth lurked the cold reality of my position here. I was Lucy's caretaker. Howard's employee. Nothing more.

Or was I?

The memory of his kiss burned through my carefully constructed defenses.The way he'd held me, touched me, whispered my name...

"Annie?" Howard's voice jolted me from my thoughts. "Is everything alright?"

I turned, forcing a smile. "Jus tired." The lie felt heavy on my tongue.

Lucy watched our interaction with those observant eyes of hers, a small smile playing at the corners of her mouth. Did she know? Could she sense the change between us? The thought sent panic fluttering through my chest. She'd already lost so much-what if this ruined everything? What if she resented me for complicating her relationship with her uncle?

I wanted to ask her directly: Would you be okay with this? With us? But the words stuck in my throat. Better to maintain professional distance than risk shattering this fragile peace we'd built.

"Your pancakes are getting cold," I said instead, sliding the plate toward Lucy. She accepted it with a knowing look that made my cheeks burn. The drive to school felt endless. I sat in the back with Lucy, watching the mansions of Long Island roll past as she hummed contentedly. Sarah's words from the park echoed in my mind: "Some of us understand the finer things in life... and some of us are clearly out of our depth." My reflection in the window looked small and plain beside Howard's commanding presence in the driver's seat. "Mom,can we get ice cream after school?" Lucy's innocent question pulled me from my spiral of self-doubt.

"We'll see, sweetheart." I managed a smile, grateful for the distraction.

The school gates loomed ahead, but as we approached, my heart stopped.Philip stood there.

Howard's hands tightened imperceptibly on the steering wheel.

"Hurry up. Go greeting with your teachers," he murmured to Lucy as we parked.

Lucy quickly got into the school.

Philip's smirk widened as Howard and I was here together. "Well, well.Moving on faster than I expected, Annie."
"We're divorced, Philip. My life is none of your concern." The words came out steady,though my pulse raced.

His eyes swept over Howard's elegant appearance with a calculating gaze. "That's quite an upgrade. Everything he's wearing probably costs more than your annual salary." His voice dripped with false concern.

"Where are you driving at?" I asked,afraid of the answer. "Tell me, Annie,do you really think you can fit into his world? A divorced woman from Boston, playing at being Upper East Side? You're just his latest charitable project." The words struck deeper than I wanted to admit. Everything Sarah had said at the park suddenly felt painfully true. What was I thinking,imagining I could belong in Howard's world? "Again, that's not your business. And where's Sarah by the way. I thought she would love to sent Brian to school. "I said,trying to remain calm.

"Sarah's pregnant." Philip continued, clearly enjoying my discomfort,but a bit unprepared by my question, "She needs rests."

A bitter laugh escaped before I could stop it. "Congratulations. Of course she's pregnant so soon. Or a bit too soon?"


Philip's smug expression faltered. "What are you talking about?"

I thought of Sarah's texts with Robert about their romantic weekend in Paris, her calculated plan to trap Philip with another man's child. The irony was almost painful - Philip Baker, master manipulator,completely blind to being manipulated himself.

But before I could respond, Howard stepped forward. His hand found mine, fingers intertwining with deliberate purpose. "Annie isn't a project or a charity case," he said, his controlled voice carrying an edge of steel. "She's my girlfriend."

The world seemed to stop. I stared at our joined hands, then up at Howard's face. His usual mask of careful restraint had fallen away,replaced by something fierce and certain.

Philip opened his mouth, then closed it. Without another word, he turned and walked away.
###Chapter 16:Manipulation

I dabbed at my eyes with exquisite precision, carefully smudging my makeup just enough to suggest recent tears without looking messy. The humiliation at the new theme park still burned fresh in my mind.

Everything had to be perfect now. The kitchen counter gleamed under the afternoon light, except for the artfully scattered flour and the pot of congee simmering on the stove - evidence of my "maternal efforts." The aroma of rice and ginger filled the air, a motherly touch that even Philip couldn't ignore.

"Max, darling?" I called softly towards his room. "Remember what Mommy said?"

"Yes, Mommy!" His eager response brought a genuine smile to my lips. At least one child knew how to appreciate me properly.
I settled onto the sofa, smoothing my dress carefully, and allowed myself to sink into the bitterness that had been building since the park incident.The scene kept replaying in my mind - having to apologize, to grovel in public. And all because Howard Thompson chose to defend that Boston nobody as if she belonged in our world.

My hands clenched involuntarily. Howard would pay for that humiliation. They all would. I'd worked too hard to let everything slip away now. I still remembered my first entry into this world, how I'd methodically charmed my way into Robert's life when his family's fortune still gleamed. Oh, Robert. I almost felt sorry for him sometimes. Almost. He never saw how I orchestrated his family's downfall, one extravagant purchase at a time. The endless shopping sprees, impromptu trips to Paris,charitable donations that happened to benefit my social connections - by the time he realized what was happening, it was too late. I'd already secured my position in society and jumped ship with perfect timing.

I scattered a few more crumpled tissues on the coffee table. Philip would be home soon, and this little scene I was setting would make the park incident work to my advantage after all.

The memory of Howard defending Annie at the park sent fresh waves of humiliation through me. Having to slap Max to maintain my facade...but it was necessary. Everything I did was necessary. The ends always justified the means, didn't they?

The sound of a key in the lock pulled me from my thoughts. Showtime.

I hunched my shoulders slightly, making myself look smaller on the sofa.Years of practice had taught me exactly how to position myself to appear most vulnerable. The first sob escaped just as Philip entered - perfectly timed, if I do say so myself.

"Sarah?" His concern was immediate, just as I knew it would be. "WNhat's wrong?"

I lifted my face, letting him see the carefully crafted distress. "Oh, Philip..."I made my voice tremble just slightly. "I'm trying so hard with Brian,but...
 He sat beside me, exactly as expected. Men were so predictable when it came to damsel in distress scenarios. "What happened?" 
"His stomach was still upset from yesterday, so I made him congee." I gestured toward the kitchen, pride swelling at my own attention to detail. "A mother's touch, you know? But he refused to even try it..."

"That's not true!"

Ah, right on cue. Brian stood in the doorway, face flushed with anger.Such a predictable child, really. Just like his mother- no sense of subtlety or finesse.

"You never made any congee!" Brian continued, voice cracking. "You only gave me cereal and then left with Max!"

I flinched delicately, pressing closer to Philip. Amateur hour, Brian. Really."See how he treats me?" I whispered, letting my voice catch. "After everything I've done..."


Philip's eyes narrowed as he studied Brian's face, then mine. Then,he checked Brian's arms for any signs of abuse, finding nothing but normal childhood scrapes. His gaze swept the kitchen, noting the perfectly arranged cereal boxes, the pristine countertops.

"Show me where she hit you," he demanded.

Brian's hand flew to his cheek, but of course, hours had passed. No mark remained. I'd been careful about that.

"It... it was here," Brian stammered. "But it doesn't show anymore!"

Philip's expression hardened. He turned to me, protective instinct overriding parental insight. "Apologize to Sarah right now." "But Dad, she's lying! She took Max to the theme park and left me alone!Then she hit me when she came back!" Oh, the wonderful irony. The truth sounds so much like a lie when it comes from a child's mouth, doesn't it?

"Enough!" Philip's shout echoed satisfyingly through the apartment. "Sarah has been nothing but kind to you. She's trying to be a mother to you.and this is how you repay her?"

I touched Philip's arm gently, the perfect picture of a concerned stepmother. "It's okay, really. I understand it's hard for him..." The weight of the bracelet he'd given me last week felt particularly satisfying against my wrist.

"No, it's not okay." Philip stood, towering over his son. "Go to your room and think about how you're treating someone who only wants to help you.And don't come out until you're ready to apologize properly."
I watched Brian's smaIl fists clench at his sides, noting with satisfaction how his eyes filled with tears. "You never believe me anymore," he whispered. "Never."

The slam of his bedroom door was music to my ears.

I let my shoulders shake with perfectly calibrated sobs. "Maybe...maybe this was a mistake. Perhaps Max and I should go..." The threat hung in the air like expensive perfume. "No!" Philip's response was instant, desperate - exactly as I'd known it would be. He gathered me into his arms, and I had to suppress a smile of triumph. "Please, Sarah. I'll talk to him. I'll make him understand." I buried my face against his chest, allowing myself a moment of satisfaction. Then, time for the coup de grâce. "I just want us to be a family," I whispered. "Like Howard and Annie are becoming with Lucy."

I felt him stiffen instantly. Men are so transparent when it comes to their exes.


"What do you mean?" His voice carried exactly the edge I'd been hoping for.


I pulled back slightly, studying his face with practiced innocence. "Oh...you haven't heard? Lucy's calling her 'Mom' now. They're quite the happy little family from what I saw at the park." I traced patterns on his chest,keeping my voice soft and vulnerable. "It must be nice, finding someone who fits so perfectly into your world..."


His jaw tightened - another predictable response. I pressed closer,playing my role to perfection. "I try so hard to fit into yours," I murmured. "To be what you and Brian need..."


His arms tightened possessively around me, fingers tracing fire across my skin. Through half-lidded eyes, I caught our reflection in the hallway mirror- his tall frame pressed against my curves, my head tilted back in calculated surrender. Down the hall, Brian's muffled sobs provided the perfect accompaniment to my victory.

"All mine," Philip growled against my throat. I smiled, letting my nails scrape lightly down his chest. The pregnancy test in my purse felt like a crown jewel - my final trap ready to spring. Whose child it actually was hardly mattered.

 I arched into his touch, knowing exactly how to make him lose control.Men were such simple creatures, so easily led by their desires. Robert had been the same before his fortune crumbled. "Only yours." I breathed, the lie tasting sweet on my tongue as his grip tightened further
###Chapter 17: I Was Just a Divorced Woman
Annie's POV

Philip's retreating figure had barely disappeared when Howard's phone rang. I was still tingling from his touch, the warmth of his fingers intertwined with mine sending electricity through my entire body. The way he'd claimed me as his girlfriend made my heart race - not just his words, but the possessive edge in his voice that hinted at desires barely contained beneath his controlled exterior.


His expression shifted as he answered the call, but his eyes remained on me, dark with an intensity that made my breath catch. "Yes... I understand... I'll be there immediately." He ended the call, stepping closer."The merger..."

"Go," I said quickly, though every nerve in my body screamed to stay near him."I'll catch a cab home."

"Wait." He caught my hand, his thumb tracing slow circles on my palm that made my skin burn. The simple touch somehow felt more intimate than our passionate encounter days ago. "The company library has an excellent collection, and there's a professional art studio. Would you like to spend the day there?Drawing,reading?" I looked up at him, catching the flicker of desire in his eyes before his careful mask slipped back into place. My pulse quickened at the memory of how that mask had shattered when he'd kissed me in the kitchen,how his controlled demeanor had crumbled under the force of our mutual need. "Won't I disturb your work?" My voice came out breathier than intended. His lips curved in that smile that made heat pool in my belly. "Not at all."
He leaned closer, his cologne - that intoxicating blend of tobacco and something darker - wrapping around me like a caress. "And we can pick up Lucy together after work."

How could I resist when he looked at me like that, his controlled voice carrying undertones that made me shiver? I nodded, already anticipating hours of sweet torture, knowing he was just rooms away.




Howard Technologies headquarters rose like a monument to power and success,but all I could focus on was Howard's hand at the small of my back as he guided me through the lobby. Each touch, though perfectly professional, carried echoes of that night -his fingers tangled in my hair,his mouth hot against my neck...

The curious glances and whispered conversations that followed our progress barely registered through the haze of awareness that surrounded us. This was his domain, where he was king, and watching him command this space with such effortless authority only heightened my attraction to him.


"This will be your space," he said, opening the door to a bright corner room. The windows offered a stunning view, but not as stunning as the way the morning light played across his features, highlighting the strong line of his jaw, the subtle gold in his carefully trimmed beard. An easel had been set up near the natural light, but my fingers itched to trace his profile instead. The women exchanged knowing looks. "Just a caretaker?" Amanda's perfectly sculpted eyebrow arched, "Mr. Thompson has never brought a woman to the office before. And that private art studio..." "He must really trust you with Lucy," another chimed in. Her name badge read 'Jennifer - HR'. "Though with his position and looks,he has plenty of "The library's through that door, and my office is just down the hall." His voice remained steady,but his eyes burned with barely concealed heat as they met mine. The air between us crackled with tension, heavy with everything we couldn't say or do in this professional setting. "I have meetings all morning, but my secretary can helpif you need anything." He stepped closer, fingers brushing my cheek in a touch that seemed to sear my skin. The careful restraint in his movements only emphasized the passion simmering beneath the surface. "I'Il try to join you for lunch."

After he left, I explored the room, trying to calm my racing heart.Everything was perfect, professional-grade -just like Howard himself,with his impeccable exterior hiding such delicious depths of passion. The memory of how that passion had finally broken free made me press my thighs together, fighting a wave of desire.

But lunch brought me crashing back to reality.

\---

The company cafeteria was sleek and modern, like everything else in the building. I'd barely settled at a corner table when three women approached,their designer outfits and perfect makeup making me acutely aware of my own appearance.

"You must be the lady Mr. Thompson brought in this morning," the tallest one said, sliding into the seat across from me. "I'm Amanda from Marketing."

"Annie," I replied, forcing a smile. "I'm Lucy's caretaker." options. Half the women here would kill for a chance with him."

"Well,well," the third added with a knowing smirk. "Mr. Thompson has...particular tastes in companionship. Not that anyone's had much luck."

The women exchanged meaningful glances that made my cheeks burn.

"Though his mother keeps trying to arrange proper matches," Amanda sighed. "As if someone like Mr. Thompson would be interested in settling down."


My appetite vanished as their insinuations hung in the air. The way they spoke of Howard painted a picture of a man far removed from the gentle soul who cared so deeply for Lucy. For me, our night together had meant everything. But for someone like him... perhaps it was just another fleeting moment.


They were right-what was I doing here? The passionate moments we'd shared suddenly felt like a dream.Howard could have anyone. Someone who understood his world, who could navigate board meetings and charity galas. Not a divorced mother who'd never even owned designer shoes.




The drive to pick up Lucy was heavy with unspoken words. Howard sat close enough that his warmth tantalized me, his cologne making my head spin with memories of passion. But the doubts had taken root too deeply to be erased even by the magnetic pull between us. "How did you find the company?" His voice carried that controlled warmth that both thrilled and terrified me now. "The studio was lovely," I managed, fighting the urge to reach for him."The library too." "Would you like to come back tomorrow?"

I made a noncommittal sound, staring out the window. How could I explain that every minute in his world only emphasized how much I didn't belong there, no matter how right we felt together?

Lucy was waiting at the school gates, but something was wrong. Her usual bright smile was missing, and she climbed into the car without her customary "Mom!" greeting. My heart sank further- had she somehow sensed the change between Howard and me? Was she upset about it?

"Lucy, sweetheart?" I tried, but she just stared out the window, silent as she'd been before I entered their lives.


All I could feel was darkness closing in. What was I doing? Playing at being a girlfriend to a CEO? Pretending I could be a mother to his niece?Sarah and Philip were right-I was out of my depth.

Howard's earlier words - "She's my girlfriend" - had seemed so certain this morning. Now they felt like a dream, something too beautiful to survive in the harsh light of reality. I was just Annie Baker, a divorced mother who'd somehow stumbled into a world she didn't understand.

As we pulled up to the mansion, Lucy rushed inside without a backward glance. Howard reached for me, his touch sending sparks of electricity through my body even now. But I pulled away, ignoring the flash of hurt in his eyes. "Annie..," The way he said my name still made my heart race, but I couldn't let myself be swept away again. "I should check on Lucy," I said quickly, fleeing before he could see the tears threatening to fall, before the magnetic pull between us could override my common sense again.

What had I been thinking? Some fairy tales weren't meant to come true.no matter how passionate the chemistry between its characters.
###Chapter 18: Mother and Catherine

Howard's POV

"Meeting adjourned."

The last board members filed out. I remained seated, my mind far from the merger discussions we'd just concluded. Instead, my thoughts drifted to Lucy's behavior last night -specifically, the way she'd suddenly stopped calling Annie "Mom."

The change bothered me more than I wanted to admit. Just days ago,Lucy had been making remarkable progress. I remembered how she'd curl up next to Annie during story time, the way her eyes would light up at Annie's gentle smiles of encouragement. More importantly, I recalled Annie s remarkable ability to understand Lucy's needs without words. Her professional knowledge combined with natural intuition had proven invaluable to Lucy's progress.

I believed she would find a way to work this out,just like before.

Then, the memory of that night sent heat coursing through me-Annie's soft skin under my hands, her gasps against my neck as I moved above her. She'd tried bringing up Lucy between kisses, but I'd silenced her with my mouth, my touch, until she could only whisper my name. The way she'd looked beneath me, hair spread across my pillows, eyes dark with desire... Even now, the memory of her body trembling against mine had my heart racing. It was nearly noon-time for lunch. I could spend it with Annie. The art studio door opened silently. Annie was asleep at her desk, and the sight made my breath catch. Her blouse had slipped, revealing the slightest marks I'd left on her shoulder from our passionate night together. The memory of her pressed against me, skin flushed and hot under my lips,made my body tense with want.

Watching her sleep so peacefully, all I could think about was how she'd felt in my arms, the soft sounds she'd made as I'd claimed her mouth.

I gripped the doorframe, fighting the urge to wake her with kisses.The children's illustrations on the walls just reminded me of how she looks when she's drawing - that unconscious lip bite that drives me wild with desire. Maybe I should make her position here official... though seeing her in meetings,remembering how she tastes, how she trembles when I touch her...

My phone's sudden vibration shattered the peaceful moment. I fumbled frantically for the mute button, my eyes darting to Annie's sleeping form.The screen displayed "Mother" - of course it would be her, at this precise moment.


Confirming Annie hadn't stirred, I backed carefully out of the studio.Leaning against the wall outside, I stared at the still-vibrating phone with a mixture of resignation and amusement. Howard Thompson,CEO of Howard Technologies, sneaking around like a teenager. The irony wasn't lost on me.

"Howard," Mother's voice carried its usual blend of authority and disapproval. "About Lucy and your meeting with Catherine." I str ode toward my office, keeping my voice low. "We've discussed  "Catherine would make an excellent wife for you. She comes from an impeccable background, and her family's connections. But she doesn't want to be a mother so soon-"this." "No," I closed my office door firmly behind me, my tone hardening. "Lucy stays with me."

"You're being unreasonable. A child needs proper guidance, not just a busy uncle who can barely manage his own life." Her voice sharpened."Though I hear you've found... alternative arrangements."

I tensed. "What do you mean?"

"That divorced woman you hired. Really, Howard? Do you think the board will approve of such... complications?"

"Annie is a qualified professional who's helping Lucy make significant progress."

"Is that all she is?" Mother's tone dripped with skepticism. "Meet with Catherine. Once. That's all I'm asking."

I pinched the bridge of my nose, calculating the least problematic response."Fine. Once. But my position regarding Lucy won't change."



The afternoon light was fading when an urgenat knock interrupted my work. Before my secretary could intervene, Catherine swept into my office,her designer heels clicking against the hardwood floor.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Thompson," my secretary hurried in after her."Ms.Morgan insisted-" "It's fine." I waved her out, though everything about this situation was far from fine. Catherine settled gracefully onto the visitor's couch,crossing her legs with practiced elegance. "Your mother sent me." Her smile held a predatory edge. "She says I should invite you out in person."

"Yes." I remained standing, maintaining distanace. "But you made your position clear regarding Lucy."

"Oh, that." She waved dismissively. "But I've learned a lot about you from your mother,Howard. I think we could be good together. Perhaps in time,you'll realize I'm more important than Lucy." Her smile widened. "Then we could send her to live with her grandma, where she belongs."

"Impossible." The word came out sharp as steel. "I won't pursue a relationship with anyone who won't accept my daughter."

Her eyes gleamed at my rejection. "Such devotion. It makes you even more attractive." She rose smoothly, moving closer. "I do enjoy a challenge."

I stepped back, my voice dropping to a dangerous register. "This isn't a game, Catherine. Lucy is my niece, but I take her as my daughter. This is not a negotiable condition."


"We'll see." She reached for the door, pausing to glance over her shoulder.
###Chapter 19: Reconciliation

Annie's POV

I set down my stylus and massaged my cramping fingers. The dinosaur illustration I'd been working on for hours was nearly complete, but my concentration was slipping. Howard's voice drifted through the half-open door as he conducted his business call next door. Something about his steady, measured tone helped anchor me when my thoughts started racing.It was strange how quicklyI'd come to rely on his predictable presence.

I noticed a photo on the bookshelf-Lucy with her parents before the yacht accident. The smiling, carefree child in that picture was nothing like the quiet, hesitant girl who now lived with us.

Her sudden regression worried me more than I wanted to admit. She'd stopped calling me "Mommy." No more nods or head shakes. No eye contact.It was like watching our former progress vanish overnight.

At dinner yesterday, when I'd offered her more dessert, she'd just stared at her plate with hunched shoulders. I caught Howard's frown across the table. He'd noticed too.

Something or someone had hurt her. I needed to find out what.

I tapped my tablet screen, an idea forming. If Lucy couldn't talk to me directly, maybe I could reach her through drawing-the one language I truly understood. I opened my neglected social media account and checked my illustration portfolio. The comment section was filled with messages I hadn't noticed before: "*My daughter asks for your dinosaur pictures every night before bed.*"

"*My son has your pterodáctyl taped above his bed.*"

"*As a preschool teacher, my students love your work. When will you publish a book?*"


"*Have you considered art therapy? Children connect with your style.*"

That last comment stopped me cold. I'd studied illustration in Boston before giving it up for Philip. "Just a hobby," he'd called it whenever I mentioned pursuing it seriously.

Yet here were strangers telling me my work mattered.

My gaze drifted to Lucy's family drawing on the wall. Three stick figures-Howard,Lucy,and me-holding hands under a yellow sun. I remembered her concentrated expression as she'd carefully labeled each person.

Maybe this was my answer. If Lucy couldn't talk about what was bothering her,perhaps she could draw it.

I grabbed some sketchbooks, pencils, and markers and headed to her room,hoping I was right.



Lucy sat on her bed with hands folded tightly in her lap, watching her butterfly mobile. When I walked in, she glanced up but didn't smile. "Want to help me with some drawings?" I asked, dumping my supplies on the edge of her bed. "I could use a creative partner tonight." Lucy's eyes flickered with interest. I opened my sketchbook and started drawing. "Look, it's us-you, me, and your dad." I sketched three simple figures. "What do you think?"

She leaned forward and nodded-barely, but it was something.

"Your turn." I handed her paper and colored pencils. "Draw whatever you want."


She hesitated before picking up a blue pencil. Her first marks were tentative, but grew bolder with each stroke. I drew alongside her, letting the quiet build a bridge between us.

When she finished, she pushed her picture toward me. Three figures-Howard,herself, and me-holding hands under a tree.

"This is beautiful," I said, meaning it. "You've captured us perfectly."

The corner of her mouth twitched upward.

"Let's do another," I suggested, handing her fresh paper. "Maybe those butterflies you like?"

With each drawing, Lucy inched closer until our shoulders touched.Her body relaxed, the wall between us crumbling sketch by sketch.
After our fifth drawing, I put down my pencil. "Lucy, you've been very quiet lately. Is something wrong?" Lucy froze, her marker suspended over the paper. Then, barely audible,she whispered, "Mommy..." Relief washed over me."Yes,sweetheart?" "Why didn't you call me your daughter today?""What? When?" I asked, confused.

"At school..." Her lip trembled. "Brían said you weren't really my mom.He said you're just taking care of me until... until I'm better... because my real parents are dead."


My stomach dropped. Brian-Philip's son-had found Lucy at school despite my careful efforts to keep tem apart.

"He said I stole his mommy," she continued, almost inaudibly. "He said you'll go back to him and his dad later."

I clenched my jaw, fighting back anger. A five-year-old couldn't have invented these ideas-they came from Sarah1, had to. I took a deep breath before my rage showed on my face.

"Lucy," I took her hands in mine. "Listen carefully. You are *not* stealing me from anyone. I'm here because I *want* to be here with you."

She searched my face. "But I'm not really your daughter."

"Family isn't about blood," I said, squeezing her fingers. "It's about love.And you,Lucy Thompson,have my whole heart."

I grabbed a fresh paper and drew a quick heart. "See? I'm putting the people I love inside this heart." I wrote "Lucy" in the center, then "Howard" beside it. "The truth is," I admitted, "I've always wanted a daughter. I feel lucky I found you." Her eyes filled with tears."Really?" "Really. You are my daughter in all the ways that matter.Nothing will change that."

Lucy threw herself into my arms so hard I almost fell backward.She buried her face against my shoulder, trembling. "I love you, Mommy," she whispered fiercely.

"I love you too, sweetheart," I said, blinking back tears. "So much."

We stayed tangled together until her breathing steadied. When she finally pulled away, her expression had cleared, the doubt replaced by certainty.

"Can we draw more?" she asked, her voice stronger.

"Of course," I handed her fresh paper. "What would you like to draw next?






The front door opened, but we barely noticed until footsteps echoed down the hallway. Lucy's head snapped up, her body instantly rigid.

"What's wrong?" I asked.

Without answering, she slipped off the bed and crept to the doorway.I followed,puzzled by her sudden fear.

Through the crack, I saw Howard walking toward his study, his shoulders stiff. Beside him walked an elegantly dressed older woman I recognized from photos-Margaret Thompson, his mother. Lucy backed away from the door and grabbed my hand. "Grandma's here..." she whispered, voice shaking. Hler fear confused me. What had Margaret done to make Lucy so terrified?

###Chapter 20: I Had to Do Something.

Howard's POV

I was reviewing the merger documents for the fourth time tonight. The familiar scent of aged whiskey lingered in the air - a habit I'd picked up lately, though I'd been more careful since that night with Annie. The memory of her in my arms still sent heat through my veins, even as I forced my attention back to the financial projections before me.

The door opened without a knock. Only one person would dare.

"Howard, darling." Mother's signature perfume preceded her into the room.She settled gracefully into the chair across from me, every inch the society matron in her perfectly tailored designer suit. "We need to discuss your situation with Catherine."

I continued reviewing the document before mne,letting the silence stretch.Years of boardroom negotiations had taught me the power of calculated indifference.

"You must start dating her properly," she continued, undeterred. "A few business meetings aren't enough."
"We've already met." I signed the bottom of the page, still not looking up.

"In the office." She gave a delicate sniff of disapproval. "The Morgan family's influence could be crucial for the company. You need to cultivate a more...personal connection." Finally, I set down my pen and met her gaze. "Once. That's all." Her face lit up. "Wonderful! Catherine is such an accomplished young woman-Harvard Business School, impeccable family background..." "On one condition," I interrupted. "Lucy stays with me."

The light in her eyes dimmed. "Howard, be reasonable. This merger requires the Morgan family's support. Their connections could make or break the deal."


"Is that a threat, Mother?" My voice dropped dangerously low.

She lifted her chin. "It's reality. The board..."

"Let me be very clear." I rose slowly from my chair, each word precise and measured. "Lucy is non-negotiable. And since you seem to have forgotten who provides your lifestyle..."

I reached for my phone with deliberate calm. "Susan? Please suspend all financial support to the Thompson estate, effective immediately."

Mother's perfect composure cracked. "I'm your mother!"

"Then act like it." My voice remained steady, though my grip on the phone tightened. "If you're going to rely on my financial support, you need to understand who makes the decisions now."

"I'm only thinking of your best interests!" Her voice took on that wounded tone I knew so well. "Lucy needs a proper family structure..."

"Lucy's guardianship is not up for discussion." I rose from my chair.making it clear the conversation was over. "You can either accept that, or find alternative living arrangements." The threat hung in the air between us. Mother's lips trembled slightly before pressing into a thin line. "Fine. You promised one proper meeting with Catherine. And I will talk about Lucy with her." Then, she swept from the room, her heels clicking sharply against the hardwood floors.

I waited until her footsteps faded before allowing my shoulders to slump slightly. The familiar weight of expectations - CEO,son.guardian-pressed down on me. But for once, the choice felt crystal clear. Lucy needed stability, not my mother's manipulations. And Annie...

A commotion in the hallway pulled me from my thoughts. I stepped out of the study to find Mother confronting Annie outside Lucy's room.

"You're far too pretty to be just a caregiver." Mother's voice dripped honey-coated venom. "The Thompson family is very particular about who we trust with our children. Some people have... ulterior motives."

Annie maintained her professional smile, though I could see the tension in her shoulders. "I assure you, Mrs. Thompson, my qualifications are entirely adequate."

Mother ignored her, reaching for Lucy's door. "I simply want to check on my granddaughter."

"Lucy just fell asleep," Annie said firmly, not moving from her position."Disturbing her now would disrupt her sleep schedule..."

"Oh?" Mother's voice sharpened. "So now I need a nanny's  permission to see my own granddaughter?" I'd heard enough. "That's sufficient, Mother." I'd heard enough. "That's sufficient, Mother." "Annie is Lucy's special education instructor," I said coldly, "and someone I trust implicitly. If you can't respect that, you can leave."

Mother's expression froze for a moment before her social mask slipped back into place. "Of course, dear. I'm only concerned about Lucy..." Her gaze lingered meaningfully on Annie. "Though I see you've found suitable...help."

We watched her retreat down the hallway, her perfect posture never wavering. Only when she'd disappeared did I notice how close Annie and I were standing, her lilac scent mixing intoxicatingly with my cologne.

"I'm sorry about that," I said softly.

Annie shook her head, though I could see the slight tremor in her hands."Don't be. I understand she's protective of Lucy."

"It's more than that." I gestured toward the window seat at the end of the hall. The moonlight streaming through the glass painted silver highlights in Annie's hair as we sat. "My family has... traditional views. They never approved of Lucy's parents' marriage. My brother married for love, chose his own path. It drove a wedge between him and our parents."

"Is that why Lucy rarely saw her grandparents before...?"I nodded, watching the play of emotions across Annie's face. Even discussing such painful topics, she remained breathtakingly beautiful."They thought he was throwing away his potential. Now Mother sees Lucy as her second chance-a way to mold the next generation of Thompsons properly." "You've sacrificed a lot forLucy." Annie's voice was soft, understanding.Her hand found mine in the darkness, our fingers intertwining naturally." Protecting her from that pressure, giving her space to heal..."

"We've protected her," I corrected, squeezing her hand gently. "Since you came, she's made more progress than I ever dreamed possible."

Annie's eyes met mine, dark and serious in the moonlight. The moonlight caught her hair, reminding me of how she'd looked that night in my bed.her skin glowing as she arched beneath me. The memory of her soft gasps,the way she'd trembled at my touch, sent heat coursing through my veins.

But it was more than just desire. So much more.

"Annie..." I tightened my grip on her hand, trying to focus despite how her proximity made my pulse race.

She turned to face me, and the simple movement brought her scent- that intoxicating blend of lilacs that had caught my attention ouatside her door.Memories flooded back - her body pressed against mine in the kitchen,her lips parting under my kiss, the way she made me lose control in the best possible way.

She was nothing I could lose. Lucy was doing better because of her. And she was the solace I could scarcely find. But mother must set her eyes on her. She would get rid of her no matter what. I had to do something.

"Will you marry me?"
###Chapter 21: You Should Have Told me Sooner
Annie's POV

"Will you marry me?"

Yes.

The word "yes" formed instantly in my heart, but my lips wouldn't move.

Howard's words hung in the moonlit hallway, his dark eyes fixed on mine with an intensity that made my breath catch. In that moonlit hallway,every insecurity I'd been fighting since coming here crashed over me like a wave.


The whispers in the company cafeteria, the disapproving glances at charity events, Sarah's cutting remarks about my background- they all echoed in my mind,drowning out the yes my heart wanted to scream.

I thought of Howard in the boardroom, commanding respect with every gesture. Howard at social events, moving effortlessly through a world I barely understood. Howard in his perfectly tailored suits that probably cost more than I used to make in a month. Then I thought of myself -a divorced mother from Boston who still felt lost in this glittering world of his "I apologize." Howard's voice cut through my spiral of self-doubt, his usual controlled tone carrying a hint of uncertainty. "That was... abrupt." "It's fine," I mnanaged, though nothing about this situation felt fine. I was torn between wanting to run and wanting to throw myself into his arms,to pretend for just a moment that I could belong in his world. "But you should give it serious thought." His steady gaze made my heart race, even as my mind whispered that I would never be enough for someone like him.


"Can I ask why?" The question slipped out, part of me hoping his answer would somehow bridge the chasm I felt between us. "Why do you want to marry me?"


"Because Lucy likes you very much."

His practical response hit differently than it might have before. It wasn't that his words hurt-they just confirmed what I already knew. I wasn't the sophisticated woman his mother wanted for him. I wasn't the polished socialite his board would approve of. I was just Annie Baker, who happened to be good with his niece.

"She hasn't accepted any other woman since I became her guardian,"Howard continued, in a hesitant voice- or maybe I was just imagining that hesitation. "I don't plan to waste time on relationships, so I've thought this through carefully. Us being together would be the best choice."

A small, bitter smile touched my lips. Even if he did have feelings for me beyond practicality, how long until he realized I would never fit into his world? How long until the magic of our stolen moments faded and he saw me as everyone else did- the outsider playing at belonging?

"Sorry," I whispered, the word carrying the weight of all my fears and inadequacies."I can't." Sorry,not in this way. The next afternoon, Lucy burst through the mansion's doors with unusual energy,her face flushed with excitement.

"Mom!" She ran straight into my arms, and I pushed aside the guilty pleasure I still felt at hearing that word. "Brian apologized to me today!"

I knelt to her level, studying her bright expression. "He did? What happened?"


"He came up to me at recess and said he was sorry for being mean." She fidgeted with the hem of her uniform. "Then he left really fast."

Something about that struck me as odd, but Lucy was already moving on to her next thought.

"Mom, I want to learn gymnastics."

I blinked at the sudden change of subject. "Why suddenly want to learn?"

Lucy's expression grew serious. "So next time someone says mean things,I can defend myself."

My heart ached at the implication, but I kept my voice steady. "Self-defense is important, but there are many ways to handle mean words.Would you like to talk about what happened?"

"Nothing happened since last time Brian had said those mean words.I'd just like to learn stuff." She shook her head, determination shining in her eyes."Then that's fine. I will talk to Howard." At the mention of Howard,I couldn't help but find myself a bit distracted. But actually, I had been thinking about him all day. "I want to ask daddy directly." A small smile played at her lips."I promised to talk to him more, remember?"

The casual way she said "daddy" now brought back memories of last night,after Howard's proposal.




"Grandma Margaret used to come when I was trying to sleep," Lucy had whispered in the darkness of her bedroom, her small body curled against mine. "She would call me a little mute."*

My arms had tightened around her instinctively as she continued,her voice barely audible. "She told me I was a burden. That if it wasn't for me.daddy would have found a wife already."

"That's not true, sweetheart." I'd stroked her hair, fury building in my chest at the thought of Margaret's cruel words.

Lucy had looked up at me then, hope shining in her tear-filled eyes."I want you and daddy to get married."

"You should have told me sooner, sweetheart," I'd whispered, my heart breaking at how simple the solution seemed in her young mind.

Maybe I'd been wrong about everything - about not belonging, about being out of my depth. The easy affection in her voice suggested she saw us as a real family, regardless of social standing or background. But even as hope bloomed, Margaret Thompson's perfectly controlled voice echoed in my mind: "The Thompson family is very particular about who we trust with our children." The weight of her disapproval hung over me like a sword. Lucy tugged at my sleeve, her eyes bright with enthusiasm as she planned her martial arts pitch to Howard. The trust in her gaze made my heart ache. She wanted this - wanted us - to work. And if I was honest with myself,so did I.

But Margaret would never accept someone like me as her son's wife.

Oh. god.Is this just another hope that was doomed to fail me again?
###Chapter 22: Compromise

Howard's POV

I stood before the full-length mirror, methodically buttoning a fresh dress shirt. Mother's voice echoed in my head: "Just one dinner with Catherine Morgan, Howard. That's all I ask." I'd finallyagreed,if only to keep her from interfering further with Annie and Lucy. The idea of spending an evening with Catherine held all the appeal of a hostile takeover meeting.but sometimes tactical retreats were necessary.

My hand froze mid-button as I noticed something tucked between my folded shírts - a delicate piece of black lace. Annie's underwear, forgotten in the heat of that passionate night. The sight of it sent a rush of memories flooding back: her soft gasps against my neck, the intoxicating scent of lilacs that seemed to linger on my sheets for days, the way she'd trembled in my arms...

"Damn it." I sank onto the edge of my bed, the lace material crushed in my fist. What kind of CEO was I? I could negotiate billion-dollar deals without breaking a sweat, but I'd managed to botch the most important proposal of my life with all the finesse of an intern's first pitch meeting. "Will you marry me?" The words haunted me now - how I'd blurted them out like some impulsive proposal at a board meeting. No heartfelt speech about how she'd become as essential to me as breathing. No mention of how her presence had transformed my carefully ordered world into something vibrant and alive. Just those four stark words, hanging in the air between us like an ill-prepared business proposition. I'd seen the hurt flash in her eyes before she'd covered it with that professional mask she wore so well. Of course she'd refused. What woman wants to hear that marriage is just a practical solution for childcare?

The truth caught in my throat even now, in the empty silence of my bedroom: I was terrified1. Terrified that if I revealed the depth of my feelings, she'd run. Terrified that my mother would use the Morgan family's influence to destroy her career if she became more than Lucy's caretaker.Terrified of losing the one person who'd made me feel truly alive for the first time in years.

"I should have told her," I whispered to the empty room. "Should have said it was because I love_"

My phone's sharp ring shattered the moment. Wilson's name flashed on the screen, accompanied by a video call request. I straightened my shoulders. CEO mask sliding back into place as I accepted the call.
"Mr. Thompson." Wilson's tired face filled the screen, the dark circles under his eyes testament to long hours. "The team wanted you to see our progress."

The screen filled with character designs and user interface mockups.Months of work spread before me in neat digital rows, yet something felt fundamentally wrong.
"This is what we've developed over the past year," Wilsoncontinued,pride evident in his voice. I studied the data carefully, years of experience highlighting the crucial flaw. "The entire user experience needs to be reconstructed. You're missing the core appeal for our female demographic." "Sir?" Wilson's confidence wavered. "Look at the market research." I pulled up the relevant data."Female players prioritize emotional resonance over mere numerical progression.
Your team's focus has been misplaced."

"But restructuring would take considerable time-"

"Time isn't the issue. Direction is." I leaned forward, letting my authority fill the frame. "Form a specialized user experience team. Focus on emotional design elements. We're not just creating a game; we're creating emotional value."

"Yes, sir. I'll adjust the team immediately."

As the call ended, my eyes caught on one of the character designs.The artwork was technically proficient but lacked something essential- that spark of warmth that made Annie's illustrations so captivating.I remembered Lucy's words about her mother's drawings, how they made her feel safe and understood.

Before I could second-guess myself, I was already walking toward Annie's studio. The door was ajar, soft afternoon light spilling across her workspace. She sat at her desk, completely absorbed in her work, pencil moving with confident strokes across the paper.

"Annie?" My voice came out softer than intended. "Do you have a moment?"

She looked up, and the sight of her - cheeks slightly flushed from concentration, a smudge of graphite on her chin-made my chest tighten. "I'd like your opinion on something." I approached her desk, tablet in hand. "It's a gaming project we're developing, targeted at female users.The character designs aren't connecting as they should." Annie took the tablet, her fingers moving expertly across the screen. "The proportions are technically correct, but the emotional elements are missing."She began sketching, quick strokes transforming the rigid design. "See how softening these lines changes the entire feeling? And the eyes-they need to invite connection, not just observe."


I watched her work, mesmerized by her quiet confidence. This was Annie in her element - professional, insightful, absolutely brilliant. The same woman who had transformed Lucy's world, who had somehow worked her way past my own carefully constructed walls.


The familiar scent of lilacs teased my senses as I leaned closer, supposedly to study her modifications. "The key is understanding what users truly need?"


"Exactly." She turned slightly, and suddenly we were inches apart. "It's about creating an emotional bridge, making them feel-"


My hand moved of its own accord, brushing a strand of hair from her cheek. She froze, eyes widening at the contact.

"Would you consider joining the project team and you can publish your work through our company?" The words came out rough with everything I was trying not to say. I miss you. I need you. I love-

Her lips parted in surprise, and for a moment, I almost confessed everything- how my hasty proposal had been about so much more than Lucy's welfare, how she'd become as essential to me as breathing, how the thought of tonight's dinner with Catherine made me physically ill because she wasn't- My phone buzzed again. Wilson, probably with questions about the restructuring. The moment shattered like fine crystal. Annie pulled back first, professional mask sliding into place. "I should review these designs more thoroughly before making any decisions."

I nodded, my own CEO persona providing familiar shelter. But as I headed back to my room to preparefor tonight's unwanted dinner, my hand still tingled where it had touched her skin.

Mother would be pleased with my compliance regarding Catherine, but she'd never understand. How could she, when I barely understood it myself?In the boardroom. I could orchestrate million-dollar deals without breaking a sweat. Yet here I was, undone by a simple touch, unable to tell the woman I loved the three words that mattered most.

The delicate lace still lay hidden in my pocket, a reminder of everything I stood to lose if I couldn't find the right words soon.

###Chapter 23: Date with Catherine

Howard's POV

The private dining room's muted lighting did nothing to improve my mood. Catherine Morgan sat across from me, maintaining perfect posture as the maitre d'presented our menus. Myeyes fell on a familiar dish - one I'd ordered countless times during business dinners here.

Just as I was about to speak, Catherine smiled with quiet confidence."The seared foie gras for Mr. Thompson. It's his usual choice here."

"The sea bass," I stated quietly, my tone carrying just enough authority to discourage further discussion. "With the seasonal vegetables."

Catherine's smile faltered for just a moment before she recovered with practiced grace.

"You should have been at the Met Gala last month," she began,swirling her wine with elegant precision. Her diamond bracelet caught the light with each practiced motion. "The Vanderbilts hosted the most extraordinary after-party. Charlotte - you know Charles Vanderbilt's daughter?- she had this absolutely scandalous moment with the son of that tech mogul from Silicon Valley..." I made a noncommittal sound, finding more interest in the condensation gathering on my water glass than her carefully curated society gossip.My thoughts kept drifting to Annie's genuine laugh, so different from the artificial tinkling sound Catherine was making now. "And then there was that charity auction at the Plaza," Catherine continued,leaning forward slightly in what I assumed was meant to be an enticing manner. "Mother insisted I bid on this ghastly modern art piece-all splashes and circles, really - but apparently the artist is the next big thing.Cost a fortune, but that's what tax write-offs are for, right?"

"Indeed." I checked my phone under the table, hoping for a message that could provide an excuse to end this charade early. The screen remained stubbornly empty.

"Oh, and you'll never believe who I ran into at the Morgan Stanley dinner last week." Catherine's laugh echoed like expensive crystal against fine china. "Remember Jonathan Pierce? From Harvard Business School? He's still trying to make that ridiculous startup of his work. Something about sustainable energy- as if that hasn't been done to death. His mother keeps trying to set us up, can you imagine?"

She paused, clearly expecting some sign of jealousy. I merely signaled the waiter for more water, remembering how Annie could convey more genuine emotion in a single glance than Catherine managed in this entire performance.

"Though speaking of arrangements," her tone shifted subtly,becoming more purposeful, "you should see the list Mother's compiled. All these eligible bachelors from 'suitable' families." She rolled her eyes with calculated charm. "Half of them I've already met through these tedious matchmaking dinners. Like last month, there was this absolutely dreadful evening with the youngest Sullivan heir..." I let her words fade into background noise, my mind drifting to Annie-how she would have filled this stilted silence with genuine warmth instead of practiced small talk, how her eyes would have sparkled with real humor rather than social calculation. Even Lucy's selective mutism felt more authentic than this carefully choreographed performance. "Don't you agree?" Catherine's expectant voice pulled me back to the present.

"My apologies," I said, not bothering to fake interest. "You were saying?"

I maintained my polite mask, offering minimal responses. The evening stretched ahead like an overlong board meeting, each moment measured in careful sips of wine and perfectly crafted small talk.

When the food arrived, my attention caught on the herb garnish-arranged exactly as Annie often did for Lucy's breakfast. I realized with a start that despite all our time together, Annie and I had never gone on a proper date. No quiet dinners, no evening walks, no moments that were just ours.

"I attended the most fascinating exhibition last week," Catherine offered."The artist-James Morrison? I remember you wrote that paper about his early works in college."

"He's talented," I acknowledged simply. He was an artist I admired. Then,my mind had already drifted to Annie's illustrations - how she captured emotion with such simple, elegant lines. My hand slipped into my pocket,fingers brushing against the forgotten lace there.

Yes, I brought a woman's underwear to a fancy restaurant.

And the touch brought back the memories when I returned home today. We'd just returned home with Lucy when we found Thomas Anderson,Lucy's gymnastics coach, waiting in the front yard,looking slightly uncomfortable in the heat. "Should Alfred have shown him inside?" I asked our butler quietly. "I requested to wait outside," Thomas Anderson explained quickly. "To get a feel for the space."

"It's too hot out here," I observed calmly. "We usually return around this time. In the future,please wait inside."

"Thank you," Thomas Anderson nodded, understanding the statement wasn't mere politeness. "When would you like to begin?"

I looked to Lucy, who was clutching Annie's sleeve.

Annie knelt beside her. "What is it, sweetheart?"

Lucy whispered something in Annie's ear.

"She'd like to start now," Annie explained to Thomas Anderson. "But I should mention - Lucy is a bit special. She prefers not to speak to others."

Thomas Anderson nodded understandingly and knelt to Lucy's level. "I'm Thomas Anderson. And you are...?"

Lucy darted behind Annie before he could finish.

"I'm sorry," Thomas Anderson apologized. "I forgot..."

"It's alright," Annie smiled. "Lucy, would you like me to stay with you?"

A vigorous nod.

"Where should we train?" Annie asked, looking to me. "I've had a room prepared on the first floor," I replied evenly, leading the way. The training space was large, with floor-to-ceiling windows and a spacious baleony. Thomas Anderson began with basie movements, but Lucy's stamina quickly flagged. When he tried to ask about her comfort level,she remained silent.

"For the first month. I'd recommend focusing on building her endurance through running," he told me. "Then we can progress to actual techniques."

I nodded. "You're the expert here. Make whatever adjustments you feel necessary to the training plan. No need to consult me."

After concluding the business call, I made my way downstairs,only to pause at the doorway. Thomas Anderson was leading both Annie and Lucy through warm-up exercises, but my gaze was immediately drawn to Annie.

She moved with an endearing lack of polish that was so quintessentially her-none of the affectedI grace Mother's society friends would display.Her brow furrowed in concentration, tongue caught between her teeth as she struggled to mirror the instructor's stance. The sight stirred something in my chest - how she threw herself into everything with such genuine enthusiasm, completely unconcerned with looking perfectly poised. Even in her slight awkwardness, she possessed a natural grace that I found charming. My fingers traced the lace in my pocket asI returned to the present moment, thinking of how Annie would soon bemore involved in both my work and personal life. A smile crossed my face, realizing my hasty proposal had been premature. We had time. "The Giants really dominated last weekend's game," Catherine was saying.her eyes lighting up at my smile. "What did you think of their defensive strategy?"

Lost in pleasant thoughts of Annie, I replied absently, "Very good."

"We should do this again," Catherine said eagerly.

Her words snapped me back to reality. "No," I said firmly. "I'm sorry, but I haven't followed football since college. That was just a phase, Catherine.And for future reference? Don't rely on my mother's outdated briefing about my interests. I'm not the son she thinks she knows anymore."

Without waiting for her response, I paid the bill and stood. The lace in my pocket reminded me of where I'd rather be.
###Chapter 24: A Rude Awakening of Philip

Philip's POV

Late in the morning, I woke up in our king-sized bed in our new Upper East Side mansion. I stretched lazily, enjoying the rare luxury of a weekend morning. From here, I could see the meticulously manicured garden below-another of Sarah's essential upgrades to our living situation.

My gaze drifted to her vanity, crowded with elegant bottles and jars. The sight brought a fleeting thought of our previous home, which had been perfectly adequate. But Sarah had insisted Brian needed "the right environment to thrive," and I couldn't deny that she seemed to know what was best for our family's social standing.

A piercing scream shattered my contemplation.

"Philip!" Sarah's voice carried from the kitchen. "Oh God, it hurts!"

I rushed downstairs to find her cradling her hand, face contorted in pain.The kitchen counter was cluttered with cooking implements-an unusual sight, given that Sarah had always proclaimed her disdain for cooking since we moved here and hired a chef to manage our meals.

"I burned myself," she whimpered, extending her finger for inspection.The skin looked barely pink. "I just wanted to make you a special breakfast..."

"We have a chef for this now," I reminded her gently, even as she pressed herself against me.

"But I wanted to do something special for you." Her lower lip trembled."To show how much I appreciate everything you've done for Max and me.""Let me make it up to you," I heard myself say. "How about some shopping to cheer you up?"

A radiant smile suddenly transformed her face, erasing all traces of her earlier pain from the burn. Before I could process the abrupt change, she leaned in and pressed her lips against mine. Lost in the moment, I returned her kiss without a second thought.




The jewelry store's lighting seemed designed tomake everything sparkle,including Sarah's eyes as she made a beeline for the most elaborate pieces in the display. She selected an ornate piece with barely a glance at the price tag, which she did so proficiently and rapidly that it surprised me a bit.


"Max needs something special," she declared, her perfectly manicured fingers trailing along the glass display cases. "A piece to remember his childhood by." Her eyes lit up as they landed on a sterling silver compass pendant. "This is perfect. He's always been fascinated by exploration and adventure."


The pendant was beautifully crafted, with a polished finish and clean design that would appeal to a young boy, quite expensive for a child's accessory. But Sarah was already waving over the sales associate, her voice carrying that soft, vulnerable tone she used when she wanted something."It's just... he's missed out on so many special moments. I wwant him to know how precious he is to us."


The sales associate began wrapping the pendant in a plush velvet box while Sarah detailed how she wanted Max's name and the date engraved on the back. Watching her fuss over every detail, I was struck by her maternal devotion. It made me think of Annie, how she'd always... Speaking of Annie, it seemed that she had found her new love. So soon?And after what Robert had did to her? Maybe that man beside her was just an actor or a dumb fool. No way she could be in a new relationship so soon.I would find out.

"We should get another one for Brian," I found myself saying, and for a moment, something flickered across her face. But she recovered so quickly I was sure I'd imagined it.

"Oh, darling, we spent a lot today." she purred. "We could give this one to Brian. Max would be fine..."

Before I could respond, the sales associate returned with an apologetic expression.

"I'm sorry, Sir, but your card has been declined."

My stomach dropped. For a moment, I couldn't process the words. This platinum card had accompanied me through countless power lunches and billion-dollar deals. I was Philip Baker, for God's sake. My cards didn't get declined.

"There must be some mistake." The words came out strangled,foreign to my own ears. With trembling fingers, I pulled another card from my wallet,painfully aware of the growing line behind us, the barely concealed whispers. "Try this one." Sarah's perfect composure wavered for just a second. "It must be the renovations," she laughed lightly. "All those little upgrades add up..." I nodded, though something about her explanation nagged at me. Hadn't we discussed the renovation budget in detail? But she was already moving on, suggesting lunch at her favorite restaurant, and I let the thought slip away.




Back home, Sarah pulled out an ornate box from her shopping bag presenting it to Brian. "Look what your father and I bought for you,darling. Do you like it?"

Brian took the box without much enthusiasm, opening it quietly. His subdued reaction was unusual for a child receiving a gift.

Sarah nudged Max with her elbow.

Max lifted his head and looked at the box in Brian's hands."I wish I had a pendant like that..."

"My dad never bought me anything like this," he continued softly. "Not once in my whole life..."
He glanced at me, while Sarah watched expectantly.

"I did suggest buying two," I said, absently running my hand through Brian's hair.

"I was just trying to be mindful of your money," Sarah explained quickly."But now that Max wants one too..." She lowered her voice. "You wouldn't want to play favorites,would you?" Something felt off about the whole scene, but I couldn't quite grasp what.The way Max and Sarah looked at each other, how quickly the situation had turned... or was I just being paranoid? Sarah was trying to make everyone happy,wasn't she? "I'll go to the store and pick another oe tommorrow after I got off work. And I'll hear no more about it." I said to Sarah curtly.

That evening, alone in my study, I opened my laptop to review some contracts. A notification from my banking app caught my eye-a reminder about the credit card statement I'd been meaning to check. Might as well get it over with.


The screen filled with transaction after transaction. At first, the numbers blurred together as usual.

My eyes widened as I scrolled through the endless list of transactions.Designer boutiques, five-star restaurants, luxury spas, private car services...The amounts were astronomical. Sarah had spent more in a month than most people earned in a year.

I sat back in my chair, stunned. What exactly had I gotten myself into?
###Chapter 25: I was too naive.

Annie's POV

The city lights outside the floor-to-ceiling windows of Howard’s office were a shimmering backdrop to the silence that stretched between us. Howard was standing by the window, his silhouette sharp against the New York skyline. When he turned to look at me, the sheer intensity in his eyes made my breath hitch. It wasn't the look of a cold CEO anymore; it was the look of a man who had stared into the abyss and realized what truly mattered.

"I thought I lost you today," he whispered, his voice cracking with a raw vulnerability I’d never heard from him before.

In two long strides, he was in front of me. Before I could say a word, he pulled me into a fierce, protective embrace. His arms wrapped around me like a shield, as if he were trying to weld our souls together to keep the world away. I buried my face in his chest, breathing in the comforting scent of cedarwood and rain that always seemed to follow him.

The air in the office shifted, becoming thick with an unspoken longing that had been building for months. He leaned down, his forehead resting against mine. "Annie," he breathed, his hands cupping my face with a tenderness that brought hot tears to my eyes. His thumbs traced the line of my jaw, a gesture so intimate and gentle it made my heart ache.

When he finally kissed me, it wasn't just a release of tension—it was a claim, a silent promise of a future where I would never have to stand alone again. It was a kiss that spoke of everything we had endured and everything we hoped to build. We stood together in the quiet sanctuary of the office, the steady presence of each other supporting us as we let the chaos of the outside world fade away.

The mergers, the betrayals, and the shadows of the past—all seemed small compared to this. The world outside disappeared until there was nothing left but the steady rhythm of our hearts beating in sync. In that moment, I realized that the walls I’d built around my heart had finally crumbled. I wasn't just safe; I was home.
###Chapter 26: Lucy's Custody

Howard's POV

The autumn sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of my office at Howard Technologies, casting long shadows across the antique mahogany desk. I turned from the windows, where construction cranes dotted the horizon like mechanical sentinels, to face my mother, who sat perfectly poised in one of the leather visitor chairs, every inch the society matron in her impeccable Chanel suit.

"Catherine says she's willing to accept Lucy now!" Mother's voice carried a note of barely contained triumph as she straightened in her seat. The morning light caught on her designer jewelry, a calculated display of Upper East Side refinement. "She's a Morgan, Howard. Harvard Business School,family connections throughout Wall Street..."

"I'm busy." My voice carried the kind of frost that would have sent most board members scrambling for cover. "I don't have time for dating."
"This is unacceptable!" The rejection transformed Mother's carefully maintained composure into barely contained fury, her perfect makeup twisting with anger. "You must make time to see her again!"

I maintained my silence, focusing instead on the merger documents awaiting my signature. The familiar rhythm of corporate life felt like a shield against her manipulations. "Howard, you're nearly thirty-five!" She lowered her voice to that precise pitch that had once made me feel like a disappointing child."When do you plan to marry? To have children of your own?" "I don't plan to have children." The words came out measured, controlled. Mother's face turned ashen. "Is this why I just found that Annie woman wandering around your executive floor?" Mother's voice dripped with disdain. "A divorced caretaker from Boston, suddenly designing games for Howard Technologies-"

"Leave Annie out of this." The warning in my tone could have frozen the Hudson.

"I will not allow this!" Mother clutched at her pearls, perfectly groomed eyebrows contorting with rage. "She's completely unsuitable for someone of your position!"

"Planning to interfere again?" Though my voice remained steady, danger lurked beneath its surface. "Mother, remember what I said last time."

Her eyes glittered dangerously. "Oh? And what about Lucy's custody arrangement?" Her voice dropped to a silken whisper. "The court might find it...concerning that her guardian is mixing business with pleasure,especially with an employee responsible for her care. Such conflict of interest..."

The implied threat hit its mark. Lucy's wellbeing was the one area where I couldn't afford any risks.

"I'm only thinking of the family's best interests, dear," she said softly,victory evident in her measured steps as she left my office. Only after Mother's clicking heels faded down the hallway did I allow my shoulders to relax slightly. The antique clock in the corner marked time with soft ticks, a counterpoint to my racing thoughts. My mind drifted to Annie's face in the car this morning - how she'd skillfully deflected my attempt to explain the dinner with Catherine,her usual warmth carefully masked behind professional courtesy. Why was she dodging me? I thought it was a perfect chance to reveal my feelings for her.

The memory of her lilac scent lingering in the confined space made my fingers tighten on the armrest.

Everything had changed since Annie entered our lives. Before her,I'd shouldered the weight of the family business alone, thrust into leadership too young after my brother and sister-in-law's yacht accident. Mother's expectations had been a constant pressure, but I'd managed by focusing solely on work and Lucy. Until Annie arrived and showed me everything I'd been missing.

I stood at my office window, watching the morning sun reflect off the neighboring skyscrapers. The weight of the company, of Lucy's future,of Mother's expectations - it all used to feel manageable when I kept my world carefully compartmentalized. Work was work. Home was home.Everything had its proper place.

Then Annie walked into our lives with her gentle smile and quiet strength,and suddenly those carefully constructed walls began to crumble. She was a strong woman who had saved her own life and a man's.

A knock at my door pulled me from my thoughts.

"Come in," I called, turning to findSusan, my secretary, entering with a portfolio. "The character designs from Miss Annie Baker, sir." She placed them on my desk with practiced efficiency. "The design team just reviewed her initial sketches. They're quite impressed with her artistic vision." I opened the portfolio, and immediately understood what they meant. Annie's artwork carried that same warmth she brought to everything-the characters seemed to breathe with life and emotion. Just like how she'd breathed life back into our home, into Lucy... into me.

"The emotional elements in her designs are exactly what we've been looking for," Susan continued professionally. "The team believes her style would resonate strongly with our target demographic."

"They're right," I agreed softly, thinking of how naturally she'd connected with Lucy, breaking through barriers that countless specialists hadn't been able to touch. "She has a gift for understanding what people need."

Susan hesitated, then added carefully, "Several board members stopped by earlier. They were quite interested in her portfolio."
I stared at Annie's signature in the corner of one illustration,remembering how she looked when she worked - that slight furrow of concentration between her brows, the way she bit her lip when she was particularly focused. The memory stirred something in my chest.
"Sir?" Susan's voice brought me back to the present. "Should I begin preparing any paperwork regarding her position?" The rooftop garden offered a refuge from the corporate atmosphere below,autumn wind carrying the faint scent of late-blooming flowers. I found Annie at her spot near the rose trellis, completely absorbed in her sketchbook. The October sunlight caught in her hair, highlighting subtle auburn threads I'd never noticed before. I allowed myself a moment to simply watch her work, admiring the way she bit her lower lip in concentration, how her hand moved with suchcertainty across the paper. The familiar surge of desire mixed with something deeper, more dangerous.

"Your designs are excellent," I said finally, moving to lean against the railing beside her. "Would you consider working here permanently?" I held out the contract I'd had legal prepare this morning.

Annie accepted the document, but her eyes widened when she reached the salary figure. "A hundred thousand?"

"Too low?" I couldn't quite suppress my smile.

"It's too much!" She looked up at me, genuine shock written across her features. "The market rate for illustration work isn't nearly-"

"You're surprisingly un-mercenary." The observation carried more weight than I intended.

"I'm already fortunate." Annie set down her sketchbook, autumn wind tugging at loose strands of her hair. "Having work I love, being abe to care for Lucy..." She turned to face me, sincerity shining in her eyes. "It's more than I ever expected."

"Annie." Her name came out softer than I intended,weighted with everything I couldn't seem to say. "You don't need to be so careful with me."

"And what about Lucy's custody arrangement?" However, my mother's voice rang in my head just as I thought I could tell my feelings for Annie.
###Chapter 27: A Tie

Annie's POV

The late afternoon sun streamed through the large windows of my new office at Howard Technologies, painting my workspace in warm golden light. I sat at my desk, staring at the contract Howard had handed me on the rooftop garden. My fingers traced over the salary figure again -a hundred thousand dollars. The number still felt surreal.

But it wasn't the generous salary that kept pulling my thoughts back to that moment on the roof. It wasthe way Howard had looked at me, the weight of unspoken words hanging between us. I'd seen something in his eyes then, something that made my heart race even now. He'd opened his mouth as if to say more, but then closed it again, that familiar mask of control sliding back into place.

The memory of his cologne, mixing with the scent of autumn roses,made my fingers tighten on the contract. Howard Thompson was a mystery I couldn't quite solve -one moment the commanding CEO, the next showing glimpses of vulnerability that made me want to reach out and...

I shook my head,forcing my attention back to the present. The design team had already welcomed me warmly, showing me around the creative department and setting up my workstation. They'd been impressed by my portfolio,treating me with a professional respect I hadn't experienced in years. Yet I couldn't shake the feeling that I was living in a dream that could shatter at any moment. "Miss Baker?" Howard's secretary appeared at my door. "Mr.Thompson asked if you needed a ride home." "No, thank you." I smiled, gathering my things. "I have some errands to run first."

I needed time to think, to process everything that had happened. And maybe, just maybe, find a way to express what I couldn't seem to say in words.




The Manhattan shopping center buzzed with early evening activity as I made my way through the men's department. My fingers ghosted over various ties, considering and dismissing each one until I reached a deep blue jacquard piece. The subtle pattern caught the light beautifully,and I could imagine how it would bring out the blue in Howard's eyes when he was deep in thought at his desk.

A smile tugged at my lips as I remembered how he looked during meetings-commanding yet somehow vulnerable when hethought no one was watching. The tie felt rich and substantial between my fingers,worthy of a CEO but not flashy. Just like Howard himself.

"Change the color. I don't like it."

The familiar voce froze me in place. I turned slowly to find Philip standing behind me, his expression caught between amusement and something darker.

"That man with you at Upper East Side Private Preschool," he continued,his casual tone belied by the sharp look in his eyes. "What exactly is your relationship with him?" I met his gaze steadily. "Just like I don't concern myself with your affairs with Sarah, my personal life is none of your business. We're nothing more than strangers now." "We were married, Annie..." Philip stepped closer, using his height to loom over me in that way that used to make me feel small.

"That's in the past." I cut him off firmly, no longer the timid woman who had once sought his approval.

"You can't just marry some random man for revenge." His tone carried that patronizing note I'd grown to despise.

"Revenge?" I let out a short laugh. "What makes you think you're worth taking revenge on?"

Philip's expression shifted, smugness replacing concern. "Because you loved me so much, of course!"

"You're right." My quiet admission seemed to catch him off guard."I did love you. But that's all in the past. I've moved on from that relationship,built a new life. Every day now, I wake up happy." I met his gaze directly."Please don't interfere with my life anymore."

Philip moved to block my path. "After sharing a bed for years, how can I stand by and watch you make a mistake?"

"Philip Baker." I felt steel enter my voice, strength I'd discovered since leaving him. "I'm single, divorced, and perfectly entitled to build a new family. As for mistakes?" My lips curved in a bitter smile. "You should examine your own actions. Having an affair while we were married,turning Brian against me with Sarah - you never stopped yourself then.What right do you have to lecture me now?" Philip's perfect facade slipped for just a moment. I turned away without waiting for his response - I'd already spent too many years of my life caring about Philip Baker's feelings. At the register.I pulled out my own credit card - not the supplementary one Philip had given me, which I'd returned along with my wedding ring.The tie was expensive, but it would be the first gift I'd bought with the salary I earned from taking care of Lucy. The thought made me smile - for the first time in years, I was spending money I'd earned through my own efforts.





The warmth of the Thompson mansion welcomed me home, chasing away the chill of my encounter with Philip. I found Howard in his study,the desk lamp casting a gentle glow over his concentrated expression as he reviewed documents. The familiar scent of tobacco and cologne wrapped around me like a comfort blanket.


He looked up at the sound of my entrance, his features softening almost imperceptibly. "You're back late."


"I bought some things for Lucy." I paused, then pulled out the carefully wrapped box. "And... this is for you."

Howard accepted the gift, his dark eyes lingering on my flushed cheeks for a moment that seemed to stretch into eternity.


"It's just... thank you for everything." My voice grew softer, more uncertain.

Howard opened the box with careful precision, studying the deep blue tie with an unreadable expression. After what felt like hours, he looked up."Would you help me put it on?"

I blinked in surprise. "You don't know how to tie a tie?"

"I usually buy pre-tied ones." A hint of embarrassment colored his admission. "Just slip them on when needed." The confession startled a small laugh from me.Howard Thompson,the powerful CEO who could command a boardroom with a single look, didn't know how to tie a tie. It was endearing in a way I hadn't expected - this tiny imperfection making him suddenly more human, more real. The thought warmed something in my chest.

I stepped closer, taking the silk length in my hands. Howard's proximity made my pulse quicken - I could feel the warmth radiating from him.smell the lingering traces of his cologne mixed with coffee and tobacco.In the quiet study, our breathing seemed unnaturally loud.

"Annie." Howard's voice dropped to nearly a whisper. "Would you..." He trailed off, just as he had on the rooftop garden.

"Yes?" My fingers stilled on the tie, heart thundering in my chest.

"Would you... be willing to help me with my ties from now on?"

The question hung between us, weighted with everything neither of us seemed able to say. I nodded, not trusting my voice. My hands trembled slightly as I finished the knot, smoothing the silk against his chest.

"Perfect," Howard murmured, though his eyes weren't on the tie.

I stepped back, suddenly aware of how close we were standing. The lamplight caught the blue threads in the tie, making them shimmer like the depths of Howard's eyes. I'd been right - it suited him perfectly.

"I should check on Lucy," I managed, though leaving was the last thing I wanted to do.


Howard nodded, that masklike control settling back over his features. But as I reached the door,his voice stopped me.
"Annie?"

I turned,heart leaping at the intensity in his gaze.

"Thank you." The words carried a weight far beyond the simple gift. "For everything."
###Chapter 28: Do You Still Love Her?

Annie's POV

The steam from the shower had filled the bathroom with a warm, eucalyptus-scented mist. I leaned against the counter, waiting for Howard to finish. When the water finally stopped, the silence that followed felt heavy with a comfortable intimacy.

Howard stepped out, a towel draped low around his waist. In the soft light, the exhaustion of the day seemed to have melted away, replaced by a quiet strength. I watched him run a hand through his damp hair, a simple, everyday gesture that somehow made my breath catch. It wasn't about the perfection of his form; it was about the fact that he was here, with me, in the quiet sanctuary we had built together.

"You're staring," he said, a playful glint appearing in his dark eyes as he caught my reflection in the mirror.

"I'm observing," I corrected, a small smile playing on my lips.

He walked over, the warmth from his body radiating toward me. He didn't say anything, but the way he looked at me—with a mixture of reverence and undeniable affection—said more than any grand declaration could. He reached out, his hand gently cupping my cheek. His skin was still warm from the shower, and his touch sent a soothing spark through me.

"Everything we've fought for," he whispered, his voice low and steady, "it's all worth it for moments like this."

I leaned into his touch, closing my eyes. The physical attraction was there, a constant hum in the background, but it was the profound sense of safety I felt in his presence that truly mattered. In that small, steam-filled room, we weren't a CEO and a survivor; we were simply two people who had found their way home to each other.###Chapter 29: Gossip

Annie's POV

"Knock-knock!" The cheerful voice interrupted my attempt to organize the mountain of art supplies on my new desk. Susan Moore, Howard's executive secretary, stepped into the office with the kind of graceful efficiency that made even the simplest movement look choreographed. "Time for your official welcome package."

I set down the bundle of pencils I'd been sorting, still trying to wrap my head around the fact that this spacious corner office was now mine. The drawing tablet, dual monitors, and rows of storage cabinets seemed almost too perfect- like a dream I might wake up from at any moment.

"Getting settled in?" Her smile was warm but evaluating as she placed a security badge and stack of papers on my desk. "These need your signature."

I accepted the ID badge and building access card, studying my surprisingly professional-looking photo. "Thank you for helping me get settled in."


Susan lingered, adjusting papers that didn't need adjusting. After a moment, she glanced at the doorway before leaning in slightly. "what do you think of our CEO?" Her tone carried that specific blend of professional discretion and carefully measured friendliness. "He's a fair and generous employer," I replied, proud of how steady my voice remained despite the way my pulse quickened at just the thought of him.I smoothed my skirt, grateful for the excuse to avoid eye contact. "Just an employer?" Her arched eyebrow spoke volumes.I met her gaze steadily. "What else would he be?"

Susan's laugh tinkled like expensive crystal. "Oh, you're good. No wonder he..." She caught herself, switching topics smoothly. "Let me get you set up on our internal communication channels."

Within minutes, my laptop pinged with Slack notifications. The channels appeared one by one:


\-#general-announcements

\-#office-social

\-#design-team

And finally, a private invitation to #tea-room.

"That last one's our unofficial water cooler," Susan explained with a conspiratorial wink. "Keep certain conversations away from Mr. Thompson's attention, if you know what I mean."

I nodded, maintaining my professional mask even as my stomach twisted.The #tea-room channel was already buzzing with activity:

"Today's suit count: Navy pinstripe. That makes three navy suits this week.Not that anyone's keeping track..."

"Mr. Thompson just walked through the finance department carrying some cartoon mugs. Anyone else's heart melt?" "He's been hitting the gym more lately - not that I'm keeping track." "My cousin works at Le Bernardin and swears she saw him having dinner with Catherine Morgan last week. But like, was it a DATE date or a business thing? Need details!" "Pretty sure his coffee order is just plain black coffee. How does someone so successful drink something so basic?"

"New theory: he has a secret family somewhere. No way someone that perfect is really single."

"Um, did anyone else notice he actually SMILED today during the morning meeting?"

I nearly dropped my laptop. The messages blurred together, a mix of workplace gossip and wistful speculation about Howard's carefully guarded private life. My fingers tightened on my mouse as I scrolled past their desperate attempts to piece together fragments of the man I was starting to know- the way his voice softened when he spoke to Lucy,how he actually preferred tea to coffee but drank coffee to stay alert, the tiny crease between his brows when he was truly concentrating rather than just being polite.


"But seriously," a new message popped up, "has anyone ever seen him actually date anyone? Like,ever?"

"Margaret Thompson's been trying to set him up with every eligible socialite in Manhattan. But he never seems interested."

"Maybe he's just really dedicated to his work and Lucy? That's kind of hot tbh."


"Oh,before I forget," Susan's voice pulled me back to the present, "Caroline Gluck from publishing wants to meet you. She's quite influential in the children's book world."

As if summoned by her name, a private message popped up on my screen:

*Caroline Gluck: You're the new creative director?* I typed carefully: *Yes. I'm the new creative director.

*Caroline: I'm swamped with deadlines, but I'd love to review your portfolio when things calm down.*

*Annie: No rush, I'm still settling in.*

The exchange felt loaded somehow, as if Caroline was testing waters I couldn't quite see. Before I could analyze it further, a familiar cologne announced Howard's presence. He stood in my doorway,two coffee cups from the executive lounge in hand.

"Excuse us, Susan." His tone was polite but firm. Susan extracted herself with practiced grace, though I noticed how her eyes darted between us before she left.

The rich aroma of dark roast coffee filled my senses as Howard set the ceramic mug on my desk. Even this simple gesture showed his attention to detail-he'd noticed I preferred real mugs to disposable cups. Just like he noticed everything, with those dark eyes that seemed to see straight through my professional facade.

"How are you finding the new position?" His voice carried that subtle warmth that seemed reserved for private moments like this.

"Busy, but in the best way." I wrapped my hands around the warm mug.trying not to notice how his rolled-up sleeves revealed strong forearms,or how his cologne-that intoxicating blend of tobacco and something darker - made my pulse quicken, "It's challenging and fulfilling." "It's gratifying to see you thrive here." The intensity in his gaze made my breath catch. How did he manage to make such a professional comment sound so intimate? The moment stretched between us, charged with everything we couldn't say. My eyes flickered to the still-open #tea-room channel on my screen.where messages continued scrolling:

"Has anyone noticed the CEO seems different lately? More relaxed..."

"That dinner at Le Bernardin with Catherine Morgan must have gone well.11


"Mr. Thompson never brings women to the office. But that Catherine Morgan - apparently she's exactly what his mother's been hopingfor."

I forced myself to look away from the chat, even as my mind wandered treacherously. Living under his roof had given me glimpses of a different Howard- one who wore reading glasses while reviewing documents late at night, who took his coffee black and sometimes hummed unconsciously while lost in thought. The Howard these employees desperately tried to understand through company gossip.

His phone buzzed, shattering the moment. Howard straightened, CEO mask sliding seamlessly into place. The transformation was fascinating-watching him switch from the man who made my heart race to the executive who commanded respect with a single glance.

The afternoon passed in a blur of project briefings and software setups.I was deep in a character sketch when my phone buzzed with an unknown number.


"Annie Baker speaking." "I'm Philip's friend."

###Chapter 30:My Good Friend

Sarah's POV

From behind the tinted windows of our Mercedes SUV, I watched the aftermath of Brian's conversation with Annie. The boy had clearly not expected her response to be so distant. Now Philip leaned against the car door, his gaze fixed on our crying son near the school entrance. Despite Brian's obvious attempt to maintain composure in front of his classmates,tears streamed down his face. Each sob made Philip's expression tighten in a way that fascinated me.

"Are you feeling sorry for Brian?" I studied Philip's reaction carefully.noting the slight clench of his jaw. When he remained silent. I pressed further. my voice deliberately casual. "Or perhaps... you're thinking about getting back together with Annie?"

Instead of answering, Philip yanked open the back door and slid inside.My heart skipped a beat. Why wasn't he responding? Had I accidentally stumbled onto something?

I took a deep breath, fighting to maintain my composure while my mind raced through possible ways to redirect his thoughts. Finally, he spoke:"No."


I lounged against the door, adopting a playful tone that masked my inner tension. "I didn't think so. After all, Annie's hardly wife material, is she?” "She didn't even wait until your divorce was final before sleeping with Robert," I continued, watching his reflection in the rearview mirror. "He even had video evidenace. And now she's already cozying up to Howard Thompson."

 I knew Philip's feelings for Annie better than anyone. That's why I had to systematically poison his perception of her, make him believe his lingering attachment was meaningless. More importantly. I needed him to believe I was the one he truly loved.

"You're being crude." Philip's voice carried an edge of displeasure as he fastened his seatbelt. "Sarah, we both know exactly why she ended up with Robert that night."

He paused, then added that he wasn't sure about Annie and Howard's relationship, but insisted there couldn't be anything romantic between them. He claimed he'd seen enough couples to know that Annie and Howard's interactions were too formal,too distant.

My fingers instinctively tightened on the hem of my designer blouse. Was he actually defending her?

"I'd prefer if you acted like none of this ever happened," Philip said firmly.

I turned away, struggling to keep my expression neutral. The mention of Robert's video had actually calmed my nerves somewhat. As long as that evidence existed, Philip and Annie could never reconcile. The thought was oddly comforting.

"Did you hear me?" Philip's tone sharpened at my silence.

"Mm-hmm," I murmured noncommittally, already plotting my next move. Eager to shift away from Annie-related topics, I brightened my voice. "Oh,don't forget about tonight's party." The mention of his friend's gathering finally brought a smile to Philip's face."Are you coming?" I shook my head, letting my hand drift to my stomach in a practiced gesture. "Not tonight. In my condition, I shouldn't party too hard. It might harm the baby. You go ahead, darling."

"Take care of yourself while I'm gone." His voice softened with concern.

I laughed lightly. "You're worrying about me after just a short outing?"Even though my relationship with Philip was purely transactional -his money for my carefully crafted perfect wife act-his genuine concern still sent a pleasant warmth through my chest. "Don't worry, I'Il be fine."




The unexpected call from Caroline interrupted my peaceful evening at home. I was curled up on my imported Italian leather sofa when her name flashed across my phone screen.

"What made you think of calling me?" I asked,curiosity piqued.

"Guess whose work I'm editíng at Howard Technologies?" Her voice dripped with smug satisfaction.

I sat up straight. "Annie?"

"Exactly!" Caroline confirmed. "I've reviewed her work - it's all warm and fuzzy family stuff. Not likely to be a hit. But the company's throwing so many resources at it..." "And me?" I continued, warming to my plan. "I'll be the loving mother who saved Brian, the devoted wife Philip deserves." "Perfect!" Caroline exclaimed. "Once your work is ready, I'll tell management that Annie's stories aren't connecting with readers. For the company's future, we'll need to pivot to promoting your series instead."turned serious,"I could ensure most of those resources go to your project instead."

When I didn't immediately respond, she pressed on. "Think about it-if your manga takes off. you could make more than whatever you're getting from Philip. It could be your safety net, just in case things go south with him."


"What exactly is Annie drawing?"I asked, my mind already spinning with possibilities.


"Aside from the project, she would draw some stories about her life with a child."

My eyes narrowed as an idea took shape. "That does sound boring.Caroline, what if I drew something based on my experiences? We could portray Annie as a gold-digger who abandoned her child to climb the social ladder. Once readers figure out who inspired the character,they'll despise her."

Philip might want to keep Annie's scandal with Robert private, but I intended to make it public knowledge. Even if Philip still harbored feelings for Annie, he'd never choose her once her reputation was destroyed. Then I could rightfully maintain my position as his wife.

"They absolutely would!" Caroline's enthusiasm was palpable. We shared a laugh, reveling in our scheme. They thought they were setting up a new project for Annie? In the end, it would serve our purposes instead.

As I ended the call, satisfaction settled over me like an expensive cashmere throw.Everything was falling into place. Annie might have her little fantasy with Howard Thompson for now, but soon enough, she'd learn what happens to people who try to take what's mine.
###Chapter 31: Regrets

Philip's POV

From our private booth in the upscale bar, the city stretched out below like a carpet of lights. The half-empty bottle of scotch commanded more of my attention, its amber depths promising temporary relief from thoughts I couldn't seem to shake.


"You might want to slow down there, Phil." Allen's voice carried that irritating note of concern from across the table.

"Did you know," I said, ignoring his suggestion, "that Annie bought Howard a tie?" The words burned worse than the scotch. "Navy jacquard.With some kind of pattern on it."

"A tie?" Allen exchanged glances with James and Marcus. "That's what's got you drinking like this?"

"Six years of marriage..." My glass hit the table harder than intended."She used to spend hours picking out my ties, matching them with my suits.She knew exactly what I liked." I took another sip, the memory of Annie's thoughtful smile twisting something in my chest. "And now she's doing the same thing for Howard. Like those six years meant nothing."

"And Sarah doesn't pick out your ties?" Marcus's question hit a nerve. "Sarah?" I laughed bitterly. "Sarah doesn't even help Brian pick out his clothes for school. This morning he wore the same shirt as yesterday because she was too busy shopping for herself. Annie would've..." I caught myself,draining the glass instead of finishing that thought. Marcus leaned forward in his seat. "Phil, buddy, is this really about a tie?" "You don't understand." The alcohol was making my tongue loose, my carefully constructed walls beginning to crumble. "She used to spend all her time taking care of our home, making everything perfect for me and Brian. And now..." Another sip. "Now she's working for Howard. Howard Thompson."


I stared into my glass, the bitter taste in my mouth having nothing to do with the scotch. The thought of Annie in Howard's world, in his company,made something twist painfully in my chest.

"Isn't that what you wanted?" James cut in. "For her to move on?"

"Not like this," I muttered. "Not with him."

"I thought you wanted the divorce," James pointed out carefully. "Wasn't that the whole point? To marry Sarah?"

The mention of Sarah's name sent an uncomfortable ripple through my stomach. Or maybe it was the scotch. "Sarah," I muttered, "keeps maxing out my card at high-end stores. Twelve thousand dollars last week. For shoes."


"At least Annie was practical," I continued, the words spilling out unchecked. "Always budgeting, making grocery lists... God, I used to find that so embarrassing. The CEO's wife, using coupons..." Allen's eyebrows drew together. "Speaking of Annie... there's something I've been meaning to ask. That video with Robert-the one that triggered the divorce.Was that really..." "There's video evidence!" I snapped, but even to my own ears,the protest sounded hollow. "She slept with him!""Did she?" Marcus's voice was quiet but pointed. "Because last time you were this drunk, you said something about Sarah setting the whole thing up."

The room seemed to tilt slightly. "That's not... I mean..." I reached for the bottle again, but Allen moved it out of reach.

"What I don't get," James mused, "is how she went from being your supposedly unfaithful ex-wife to Howard Technologies' new creative director. That's quite a career jump."

"Howard," I spat the name like a curse, "keeps giving her everything. The job, the office... Did you know Brian's private school tuition is probably more than Annie's old annual salary? And she just..." I waved my hand vaguely, "She just gets it all handed to her!"

"Handed to her?" Allen's laugh held no humor. "Phil, she's been working on children's books for years. Those sketches she used to do for Brian?The ones you called a waste of time? Turns out they were pretty valuable after all."


My head was swimming, memories blurring together. Annie at her deskin our old apartment, working late into the night on her illustrations. Annie trying to show me her portfolio, while I checked emails. Annie's face when I told her to focus on being a proper CEO's wife instead of chasing pipe dreams...


"She's supposed to be struggling," I mumbled, slumping against the seat."She's supposed to regret leaving me..." "Leaving you?" Marcus's voice seemed to come from very far away. "That's not how I remnember it." The room was spinning now. I closed my eyes, but that only made itworse. Through the alcoholic haze, I heard my friends' voices growing distant:

"You know what's really ironic about all this?"

"What's that?"

"Philip thought divorcing Annie would punish her. Instead,he basically gift-wrapped her a better life. Have you seen how Howard looks at her?"

"Better than how Sarah looks at Philip's bank statements, that's for sure."

"Speaking of Sarah, did you hear about her ex-husband's latest scandal?"

"Robert? Yeah,apparently..."

The voices faded into a dull roar as consciousness slipped away. My last coherent thought was of Annie - not the polished professional who now moved so confidently through Howard's world,but*my* Annie,sitting cross-legged on our old couch, sketching while Brian napped beside her.The memory carried a sharp ache Icouldn't quite blame on the scotch.

\---

"Should we call him a car?"

"Already done. His driver's waiting downstairs." I surfaced briefly to find Allen and Marcus supporting me toward the elevator.Everything blurred into indistinet shapes through my half-closed eyes. "You know," Allen's voice floated somewhere above my head, "for someone who claims to be happily remarried, he sure spends a lot of time thinking about his ex-wife." "The best part?" Marcus's reply felt like a final twist of the knife. "Annie's probably not thinking about him at all."


The truth in those words hurt more than any hangover could.
###Chapter 32: Confrontation

Annie's POV

The house was finally silent, a rare and precious moment of peace after the relentless chaos of the recent merger talks. Howard sat on the edge of the bed, his figure framed by the soft, silvery glow of the moonlight filtering through the curtains. He looked exhausted, the invisible weight of his family’s legacy and the pressures of his empire visible in the slight slump of his shoulders.

I walked over quietly and placed my hands on his shoulders. I could feel the tension ripple beneath his skin, the knots of stress that he carried so stoically for everyone else's sake. He reached up, covering my hands with his own. His palms were warm, sending a familiar, grounding spark of connection through me.

"You don't have to carry the world on your own, Howard," I said softly, my voice barely a whisper in the quiet room.

He turned toward me, pulling me down to sit beside him. The gaze he leveled at me was raw, completely stripped of his professional mask. In the dim light, I didn't see the tech giant or the billionaire; I saw the man who had fought for me, the man who loved Lucy with a fierce devotion, and the man who was learning to trust again.

He leaned in, his kiss slow, deliberate, and filled with a profound sense of gratitude. It was a moment of deep intimacy that transcended the physical—a recognition of the scars we both carried and the healing we had found in one another’s presence. There was a powerful attraction between us, yes, but it was anchored in something much deeper than mere desire.

As he held me, I felt a sense of belonging that no contract or title could ever provide. The connection we shared was a constant current, but it was the strength of his character and the quiet beauty of his soul that truly held me captive. Wrapped in each other's arms, we watched the moonlight shift across the floor, knowing that whatever challenges tomorrow brought, we would face them as a single, unbreakable unit.
###Chapter 33: A Peaceful Night

Annie's POV

Lucy was still holding my hand as we walked into the house, practically skipping with leftover excitement from our outing. Her notebookclutched tightly against her chest, she kept stealing glances up at me with bright eyes,clearly bursting to show off her latest drawings. That infectious joy vanished the instant she spotted Thomas waiting in the living room.

She ducked behind me with the practiced stealth of a child who thought she couldn't be seen if she couldn't see others, though her fluffy pigtails still poked out on either side of my legs. When Thomas stood up with his usual cheerful greeting, Lucy responded by trying to make herself even smaller, her little fingers twisting anxiously in my skirt.

"Time for today's training!" Thomas announced, and Lucy immediately thrust her notebook forward like a shield, pointing earnestly at her unfinished drawings. When that didn't work, she tilted her head back to give me her best puppy-dog eyes -a new technique she'd been perfecting lately, though the effect was somewhat spoiled by her trying too hard not to smile.


Howard stepped forward, clearly fighting back a smile at her theatrical display. "Perhaps we could all join in today," he suggested,already loosening his tie. Lucy's eyes lit up at this unexpected development. She straightened up,though she kept a firm grip on both my hand and her precious notebook as we made our way to the backyard. Her excitement at having us participate was obvious in the way she bounced on her toes, even if she tried to maintain what she probably thought was a serious expression. She nodded sleepily, making no protest when Howard scooped her up.Her head nestled naturally against his shoulder, one small hand still clutching her notebook while the other reached out to grab a fistful of my sleeve, as if to make sure I was coming too. By the time we reached her awing to running. She took off with all the coordination of an excited puppy, her little legs moving in their own unique rhythm as her arms windmilled enthusiastically. Her ponytails bobbed wildly out of sync with each other, and she kept glancing down at her feet as if to make sure they were still doing what she told them to. Howard and I jogged beside her,trying not to chuckle at her endearingly wobbly run. As she passed the hundred-meter mark, her face scrunched up in concentration, tongue peeking out slightly at the corner of her mouth - a habit that appeared whenever she was trying extra hard at something.

The final stretch proved to be the biggest challenge. Her pace slowed, but that determined little frown stayed firmly in place. Just when it seemed her energy might give out, she caught sight of a butterfly near the finish line. Suddenly energized, she made a wobbly dash toward it,arms outstretched, completely forgetting this was supposed to be a serious training session. She crossed the finish line in pursuit of her winged friend,then promptly flopped onto the grass, her chest heaving with exertion but a triumphant smile on her face.

"Did you see?" she whispered breathlessly to me, pointing at the butterfly that was now well out of reach. "It was purple!"

Howard knelt beside her, gently brushing grass from her disheveled pigtails. "Well done, little one." The warmth in his voice made Lucy beam with pride, even as she tried to stifle a huge yawn. "Should we get you cleaned up for bed?" room,she was already drifting off, murmuring something about purple butterflies and running shoes.




The night air had grown cooler as Howard and I stood on the balcony.The city lights spread out below us, but my attention was focused on the conversation at hand.

"I spoke with her teacher today," Howard broke the silence, his voice carrying an edge of frustration. "They claimedto be unaware of any specific issues."

I turned to study his expression, noting the tension in his jaw. "Then perhaps we should focus on her classmates. If they're the ones isolating her, they must know why."

The implications hung heavy in the air between us. Lucy's selective mutism made her an easy target for exclusion, but lately, I'd begun to suspect there was more to the story.

"I've been thinking," I ventured carefully. "Initially, I believed we shouldn't rush Lucy's progress - that she should heal at her own pace. But after what we've seen recently..." I paused, organizing my thoughts. "I think we need to be more proactive about helping he communicate with others.What's your take on this?" Howard's hands tightened imperceptibly on the railing. "I share your concerns." "She seems to open up more easily with people she's comfortable with,"I continued, thinking aloud. "People she trusts." "Her grandparents," Howard nodded. "She's always been closest to them." "Why don't we invite them over tomorrow?" The suggestion felt right the moment it left my lips. "Having more people she trusts around might help her feel secure enough to take those first steps."

"I'll make the arrangements." Howard's approval was immediate.A comfortable silence settled between us as we both contemplated the evening s small victories.


"Stay a while?" Howard's invitation was casual, but something in his tone made my pulse quicken. "The night's still young."

I should have declined. Should have made an excuse about work tomorrow or needing rest. Instead, I found myself nodding,drawn into the quiet intimacy of the moment.

"I've been meaning to thank you," the words tumbled out before I could stop them. "For everything - the opportunity to care for Lucy,the position at the company..."

"Annie." Howard's interruption was gentle but firm. "You earned those positions on your own merit. No one else could have connected with Lucy the way you have, or helped her make such progress. And your artwork?"His smile carried a warmth that made my chest tight. "That talent is entirely your own." The sincerity in his voice threatened to undo me completely. Panic fluttered in my chest as I realized how dangerously close we were to crossing lines that shouldn't be crossed. "I heard you and Catherine Morgan have been spending time together lately?" The words escaped before I could stop them,immediately followed by a wave of mortification. Howard's expression shifted, but before he could respond, I rushed to cover my obvious jealousy. "Not that it's any of my business, of course. Lucy needs to be our priority right now, and I'm still finding my footing at work..." I was babbling now, desperate to escapethe vulnerability I'd accidentally exposed. "I should probably get some rest. Early meeting tomorrow."

I fled before he could respond, my cheeks burning with embarrassment.The rational part of my brain listed all the reasons this was for the best:

1\. Lucy needed stability, not complications

2\. I had to prove myself at work

3\. Margaret Thompson would never approve

But none of those perfectly logical reasons could quite silence the part of me that wondered what Howard had been about to say. The part that remembered the warmth in his eyes when he praised my work,or the way his presence made me feel simultaneously safe and thrillingly alive.

As I got ready for bed, I told myself firmly that tomorrow I would focus on work and Lucy. Everything else was just a distraction I couldn't afford.

But as sleep finally claimed me, I couldn't quite forget the way Howard had looked at me, or the words left unspoken between us.
###Chapter 34: A Gentle Breakthrough

Annie's POV

Sitting at my desk in Howard Technologies, I found myself reviewing Lucy's therapy plan while working on some sketches. The upcoming meeting with her maternal grandparents was an important step, but something about it kept nagging at me. Lucy had made such progress in our small family circle - the way she'd chat happily with me during our drawing sessions, how she'd share stories with Howard about her day. But around strangers or even casual acquaintances, she'd retreat into complete silence,her bright personality hidden behind an invisible wall.

What if we could build on her comfort with us to help her connect with others? As I absently doodled in my notebook, a new idea began taking shape. Lucy loved the stuffed animals in her room, often acting out conversations with them that she couldn't have with people she didn't fully trust yet. She'd even started teaching them about her drawings...

The solution crystallized with sudden clarity. I quickly gathered my tablet and notes, my steps purposeful as I headed toward Howvard's office.This wasn't about changing the plan to meet her grandparents - it was about creating a gentle bridge to make that meeting more successful. Susan looked up from her desk with a knowing smile as I approached.

"He's between meetings," she said before I could ask. "Go right in." Howard was standing by his desk, reviewing something on his tablet. He looked up as I entered, his expression softening almost imperceptibly."Annie. Is everything alright?" "I've been thinking about Lucy's therapy approach," I began, settling into one of the chairs across from his desk. "With the upcoming meeting withyour parents, I think we could add something to make the transition easier for her."

Howard set down his tablet, giving me his full attention. The intensity of his focus might have been intimidating if I wasn't so caught up in explaining my idea.

"Lucy needs a bridge," I continued, pulling up some quick sketches I'd made. "Something that feels safe and familiar before she meets them in person. What if we created custom dolls? Detailed ones, designed to look like her maternal grandparents?"

I watched understanding dawn in his eyes as I explained further. "We could place them in her environment, let her get used to their presence.She could practice talking to them, play out scenarios she finds challenging.Her grandparents could even be present sometimes, responding through the dolls until Lucy feelscomfortable enough for direct interaction."

Howard leaned forward, his interest evident. "A transitional object."

"Exactly. It gives her control over the situation, lets her set the pace." My hands moved animatedly as I spoke. "We could start with simple dolls,then gradually introduce more detailed ones with voice recordings or interactive elements. The key is making the transition to meeting her mother's parents gentle and natural."

"You've really thought this through," Howard said softy. The warmth in his voice made my cheeks heat slightly. "Lucy's shown us she can connect with things that feel safe to her-her drawings, her notebook. This builds on that foundation." I pulled up more reference sketches on my tablet. "We could have the dolls made to exact specifications. Quality materials, careful attention to detail. Everything designed to make Lucy feel secure and in control."

Howard stood, walking around his desk to look at the sketches over my shoulder. His presence behind me was distracting, but I forced myself to focus on the tablet screen. "These are remarkable, Annie. The level of detail you've considered..."

"It's just preliminary," I said quickly. "We'd need to consult with child psychologists,get the design exactly right-"

"I'll have the team start working on it immediately." Howard's hand came to rest briefly on my shoulder, the touch sending warmth spreading through my chest. "Thank you, Annie. For always seeing what Lucy needs."


I turned to face him, suddenly aware of how close we were standing. His expression held something I couldn't quite read - gratitude, certainly, but also something deeper, more complex. Before I could analyze it further, he stepped back, clearing his throat.

"Would you join me for lunch? We can discuss the details further."

The invitation shouldn't have made my pulse jump the way it did. "Of course.For Lucy's project."

"For Lucy," he echoed, though something in his tone made me wonder if we were both trying to convince ourselves of the same thing. We settled at a quiet corner table in the restaurant near the office. Howard's usual commanding presence softened as we reviewed the menu together,the conversation flowing easily between us. It felt dangerous,how natural this all seemed -sharing lunch, discussing preferences, these small moments that blurred the lines between professional and personal.

"Annie?"

I realized I'd been staring at my water glass, lost in thought. "Sorry,I was just thinking about the doll project. We should probably start with-"

I was explaining the details of the doll therapy project when Howard's shoulders tensed slightly. It was such a subtle change that I might have missed it if I hadn't been sitting across from him.

A moment later, Catherine Morgan appeared at our table. Her presence seemed to fill the space with practiced elegance, though I couldn't help noticing how her arrival felt somehow...prepared.

"Howard," she greeted with carefully measured warmth. "What a pleasant surprise." The way she said it made it sound anything but surprising.

The slight tightening at the corners of Howard's mouth suggested this wasn't the coincidence Catherine was presenting it as. But before I could analyze his reaction further, Catherine turned to me with a smile that didn t reach her eyes.

She turned to me and her eyes bored into mine.

"And You are?" 
###Chapter 35: Change of Plan
The tension in his tone made me glance up sharply. This wasn't the polite deflection I'd expected from someone supposedly courting Catherine Morgan. In fact, he seemed almost... annoyed? I pushed the thought away.Reading too much into Howard's reactions was a dangerous game I couldn' Annie's POV

"And You are?" She turned to me and her eyes bored into mine.

"I'm Annie Baker. You must be Ms. Morgan." I forced a professional smile,though my stomach twisted at howperfectly she embodied everything I wasn't- old money grace, Harvard polish, the kind of woman MIargaret Thompson would approve of. Just my luck - every time Howard and I seemed to find our footing, the universe decided to remind me exactly why that was a terrible idea.

"Howard," Catherine turned back to him, effectively dismissing me with the practiced ease of someone who'd spent a lifetime perfecting the art of social warfare. "I must say, I'm surprised. When you kept declining our dinner invitations, I assumed you were simply too busy for social engagements.Yet here you are, enjoying a cozy lunch."

WNait - he'd been declining her invitations? The little flutter of hope in my chest was ridiculous and completely inappropriate, but there it was anyway.I focused on maintaining my professional expression, though I couldn't help noticing how Howard's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly at her words.


"This is a business lunch, Catherine." Howard's voice carried a warning edge I'd never heard before. "Annie and I were discussing Lucy's therapy program." t afford to play.

"Ah yes, Lucy." Catherine's smile turned sympathetic in a way that made my teeth clench. "Such a difficult situation. The Morgan family has extensive connections with child development specialists. We'd be more than happy to help arrange-"

"That won't be necessary." Howard's interruption was firm,almost harsh."I am Lucy's guardian and I say Annie has my complete confidence in handling her care."

Catherine's perfectly shaped eyebrows rose. "My, my. Things are more...complicated than I realized." She gave me another appraising look."Though I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. You do seem to have a talent for making yourself indispensable."

"Catherine." Howard's voice had turned to ice. "Whatever point you're trying to make, I suggest you reconsider."

"No point at all, darling." She placed a manicured hand on Howard's shoulder, though he subtly shifted away from her touch. "I just hate to see the Morgan family's sincere interest beingoverlooked in favor of more...convenient arrangements."

I kept my expression neutral, though my hands had clenched under the table. "Ms. Morgan, I appreciate your concern for Lucy's welfare.However,her therapy program is progressing well under the current arrangement." "How diplomatic." Catherine's laugh was like breaking glass. "Howard,really. When your mother hears about this..." "My mother is well aware of Annie's role in Lucy's life." Howard stood, his height and presence suddenly commanding. "Now, if you'll excuse us, we have business to discuss."

Catherine's smile faltered for just a moment before she recovered. "Of course. Business." She adjusted her designer bag on her shoulder."Though Howard, dear, do remember that the Morgan family's patience isn't infinite. We expect certain... considerations in return for our support."

"The only consideration I owe anyone is to Lucy's wellbeing." Howard's tone was final. "Good day, Catherine."


We watched Catherine leave, her heels clicking against the hardwood floor with military precision. Only when she was gone did Howard sit back down, running a hand through his hair in a rare display of frustration.

"I apologize for that," he said quietly. "You shouldn't have been subjected to such... tactics." He paused, studying my expression carefully. "I should probably mention - Catherine has been... monitoring my movements lately.Nothing to be concerned about, but I wanted you to be aware."

"It's alright." I took a sip of water, trying to process what had just happened. "Though I have to admit, I'm a bit confused. I thought..." I hesitated, then pushed forward. "I'd heard you and Catherine were seeing each other."

Howard's surprise was evident. "Who told you that?"

"Oh, just... office gossip, I suppose." I tried to keep my tone light,though my heart was racing. "About the Morgan family's interest in a merger through marriage..." "Annie." Howard leaned forward, his eyes intent on mine. "Catherine Morgan's 'interest' is purely financial. The Morgan family has been trying to arrange a merger through marriage for months, despite my clear lack of interest." His mouth quirked in a slight smile. "Though I'm curious why you've been paying attention to such gossip."

A warm flutter of relief spread through my chest at his words, though I tried to keep my expression neutral. The knowledge that he wasn't pursuing Catherine made me far hapopier than it should have,considering our professional relationship.

"I wasn't- I mean, I just happened to overhear..."

"Annie." His voice had softened, and something in his tone mnade me look up. The intensity in his eyes caught my breath."I-"

The waiter chose that moment to arrive with our meals, breaking whatever had been building between us. We turned our attention to our food.though the air remained charged with unspoken words.

As we walked back to the office, Howard stopped suddenly. "Actually,there's been a slight change of plans for today." His expression grew more serious. "I called Lucy's grandfather earlier and informed him of you. But Lucy's grandmother had some minor health issues lately."

My heart clenched with concern. "Is she alright?"

"Nothing serious, just routine tests. But..." He hesitated for a moment. "I thought perhaps we could take Lucy to visit them there this afternoon? It might be easier for her, actually - hospitals tend to put everyone on equal footing." Before I could gently probe this change, the teacher's voice cut through the afternoon bustle. "Children," she called, gathering the remaining students.Her next words hit me like a physical blow: "Has someone been saying
###Chapter 36: A Mother's Defense

Annie's POV

Howard and I arrived at the preschool right on time. We had important matters to resolve today, and Howard's expression made it clear he wouldn't leave until we did.

Lucy's teacher came out to meet us, clearly anticipating our arrival.Howard stepped forward, and the teacher quickly spoke before he could begin.

"The situation has been handled as we discussed," she assured us. "There's no need to worry too much."

Howard's stern expression softened slightly. After most parents had left,Lucy finally came out. Her face brightened when she saw us, and she rushed over excitedly.

"Mom, can we go home? Dad promised mac and cheese tonight!" Her enthusiasm was infectious,but I knew our plans had changed.

"Actually, sweetheart," I said gently, "we're going to visit your grandparents after this."

Lucy's smile vanished as quickly as morning frost under sunlight.Her small fingers tightened around her notebook until the edges crumpled,eyes darting to Howard before fixing firmly on the ground. The sudden shift in her demeanor made my heart clench. Lucy steals other children's mothers?"

A little girl with braided pigtails nodded, seemingly oblivious to the weight of her words."Yes."

"Who said this?" The teacher's voice remained steady,professíonál,though I noticed her eyes flickering briefly to Lucy.

"Max did," the girl answered without hesitation, adjusting her backpack straps.

The pieces clicked into place with sickening clarity. Max. Sarah's son. Of course. The realization sent a wave of cold anger through my chest-this wasn't just playground cruelty, this was calculated. Sarah's fingerprints were all over it, using her own child as a weapon. How long had this been going on? How many other subtle ways had she found to hurt Lucy, to try to drive wedges between us? Life had given me a second chance with Lucy and Howard - this time, I wouldn't let anyone take it away.

"They should be," Brian answered for him, earning a glare from Max.

Brian looked confused as he watched Max, then headed toward his waiting driver. It was clear he didn't understand why Sarah would pick up Max but never him, despite them being classmates.

"Could you wait until his parent arrives?" the teacher asked Howard. "We should address this together." Howard nodded curtly. Though his expression remained neutral, I could tell from the slight tension in his jaw that he was troubled by the situation. When Sarah finally appeared, her confident stride faltered as she spotted us. Her steps grew increasingly hesitant as she approached, finally stopping beside the teacher. "Come on, Max. Time to go home." "Mama..." Max ducked behind her, seeking protection.


Sarah's defensive posture was immediate as she tried to guide Max away,but Howard stepped forward, effectively blocking their path. His voice was eerily calm, yet carried an undercurrent of steel that made even Sarah flinch.


"Your son has been spreading malicious rumors that have resulted in my daughnter being ostracized by her classmates." His gaze was unwavering."How do you intend to address this?"


Sarah's hand tightened protectively on Max's shoulder as she felt him trembling. Her laugh was sharp and dismissive. "And how exactly are you sure it was my son?"


I stared at her in disbelief. Was she really going to deny it?

"The other children have confirmed it," the teacher saidquietly."They all say Max told them."


Sarah glanced down at Max, who nodded miserably. The confirmation seemed to steel her resolve rather than humble her. "Fine. What exactly did he say?"

"That my daughter stole Brian's mother." Howard's words were precise,measured.

Sarah's smile turned cruel. "Well, didn't she?" I felt Howard tense beside me, but this was my battle to fight. "Sarah,"I kept my voice steady, "you know better than anyone that Brian rejected me as his mother first. I didn't leave the Baker family-I was pushed out.Lucy simply welcomed someone who had nowhere else to go." I met her gaze evenly. "You know the truth, yet you're lying to protect your son from taking responsibility. Should I remind everyone exactly what you did back then?"

Though my tone remained gentle, Sarah's face drained of color. Her eyes darted between Howard and me,clearly weighing her options.

"My son made a mistake," she finally said, lifting her chin defiantly. "He's just a child - he couldn't have known the consequences of his words. Are you really going to hold a grudge against a child? Surely as adults, you can be more understanding."


I opened my mouth to respond, but Howard's hand on my shoulder stopped me.

"So you have no intention of helping us resolve this situation?" His tone was dangerously quiet.

Sarah shrugged, her confidence returning. "It's not like it caused any real harm to your daughter."

"I see." Howard nodded once, then took my hand in his while reaching for Lucy with the other. Without another word, he led us toward the car.

"But she hasn't even apologized to Lucy!" I protested as he opened the car door. "How is this fair to her?"


Howard's smile was sharp as he helped me into the car. "Do you really think a halfhearted apology would be enough? After everything they've done?"I studied his expression with growing curiosity. "What are you planning?" The corner of Howard's mouth lifted slightly, his eyesglinting with something that made my breath catch. But he didn't answer.
###Chapter 37: It Was Not Your Fault

Annie's POV

Lucy's small hand clutched mine tightly as we walked through the hospital corridors. I could feel the slight tremor in her fingers and see the anxiety in her expression as her eyes darted around nervously.

Howard walked slightly ahead of us, unusually quiet since we left the preschool. The confrontation with Sarah clearly weighed on his mind,though he maintained his protective presence.

When Lucy's grip tightened to the point of discomfort, I knew we needed a moment. Catching Howard's eye, I gestured toward a quiet alcove near the window. He nodded, understanding immediately.

I knelt down to Lucy's level, noting how her other hand clutched her ever-present notebook like a shield. "Hey, sweetheart," I kept my voice gentle,private. "Would you like to take a little break?"

"Are you nervous about seeing them?" I asked gently, smoothing her hair.

"I want to tell you something later," Lucy whispered, her voice soft but clear. "When we're back home."

"Of course, sweetheart," I said, giving her hand a reassuring squeeze."Take all the time you need. Your grandparents  will understand."Howard stepped closer, his presence providing an additional layer of security. "The doctors say your grandmother is doing well," he added softly. "This is just a routine check-up." Lucy nodded,though her grip on my hand didn't loosen. After a few deep breaths, she straightened her shoulders in a gesture so reminiscent of Howard that it almost made me smile. With a determined little nod, she indicated she was ready to continue.




Howard opened the door quietly. Lucy immediately hid behind his legs,peeking around him at the room.

Mrs. Parker lay sleeping in the hospital bed while Edward Parker sat beside her, holding her hand. The simple gesture spoke of years of deep love and devotion.


Edward looked up at our entrance, his kind eyes crinkling with immediate warmth. "Lucy," he breathed, voice barely above a whisper. He made no sudden moves, no dramatic gestures, just opened his posture slightly in welcome. "I've been hoping to see you,little one."

Lucy remained half-hidden, but I felt the slight shift in her stance -curiosity warring with apprehension. Edward seemed to understand perfectly, content to simply watch her with gentle patience.

"She's been sleeping peacefully," he explained softly, his gaze returning to his wife with such tenderness it made my throat tight. "The doctors say everything looks good - just being cautious with some new medication."

Howard moved closer to the bed, Lucy shuffling along with him like his shadow. "We came as soon as we could," he said quietly. "Is there anything you need?" Edward shook his head, then gestured towardI the hallway. "Perhaps we could step outside for a moment? Let her rest?" We filed out silently, Howard's hand automatically finding the small of my back as he guided us through the door. The gesture was so natural,so protective, that I almost missed Lucy's thoughtful observation of it. Almost.

In the relative privacy of the hallway, Edward's composure wavered slightly. His eyes filled as he looked at Lucy properly for the first tíme,years of unspoken love and grief evident in his expression. "You've grown so much," he managed, voice rough with emotion.

Lucy pressed closer to my side, her free hand seeking mine while maintaining her grip on Howard. The position might have looked awkward to outsiders, but to us, it felt like the most natural thing in the world-this little triangle of trust we'd built.

"I want you to know," Howard's voicecarried quiet authority, "that Lucy is cherished and protected. She wants for nothing, least of all love."

Edward nodded, wiping discreetly at his eyes. "I can see that." His gaze shifted to include me. "Annie, I understand Lucy has begun speaking again, at least sometimes. Even if it's limited... that's more progress than we'd dared hope for."

"Lucy is incredibly brave," I replied, feeling her small fingers tighten around mine. "She works hard every day to overcome her challenges. Any progress is entirely due to her own courage."

Lucy's grip relaxed slightly at my words, though she remained pressed close to my side. I could feel the slight tremor running through her small frame-emotion or exhaustion, I couldn't quite tell. "Perhaps we should let you both rest," Howard suggested, ever attentive to Lucy's needs. "We can come back tomorrow when everyone's had some sleep." Edward agreed readily, though his eyes lingered on Lucy with such longing that my heart ached for him. This man had lost his daughter and then, in many ways, his granddaughter too. Yet here he stood, offering nothing but patience and love.




Once we were in the car, Lucy climbed into my lap and cuddled close,finally ready to talk. These quiet moments had become our special time for her to share things she couldn't say elsewhere.

"I wanted..." her voice was barely audible, even in the quiet car. "Iwanted to tell Grandpa that I'm okay now."

"That's very thoughtful of you, sweetheart." I stroked her hair gently,feeling the tension in her small shoulders. "What stopped you?"

Lucy's fingers twisted in the fabric of my blouse, a sure sign that we were approaching something difficult."The day of the... the accident," she began haltingly,"Grandma and Grandpa both collapsed. They had to go to the emergency room too."

My heart clenched as I began to understand. Howard had gone very still in the seat beside us, listening intently.

"Margaret Grandmother said..." Lucy's voice caught. "She said if I hadn't insisted on going on the boat that day... if I hadn't wanted to see the dolphins..." A small sob escaped her. "She said it was all my fault." The surge of protective fury that rose in my chest was matched only by the icy stillness thatseemed to emanate from Howard. I forced myself to focus on Lucy, to keep my voice steady and warm. "Oh, sweetheart," I gathered her closer, feeling her tears dampen my shoulder, "The accident wasn't something anyone could have controlled- not you, not your parents,not anyone. Sometimes terrible things happen that we can't prevent or predict."


"But Mama..." Lucy's voice broke completely. "Mama died saving me. If I hadn't fallen in..."


"Listen to me," I pulled back just enough to meet her tear-filled eyes."Your mother loved you more than anything in this world. Saving you wasn't a choice for her - it was as natural as breathing. Ifshe were here right now, she would tell you that she would make the same choice every single time, without hesitation."

Lucy's sobs grew harder, years of pent-up grief and guilt finally finding release. "Grandma and Grandpa were so sick afterward... Margaret Grandmother said they might die too, and it would be my fault..."

I felt Howard's sharp intake of breath, saw his hands clench into fists in my peripheral vision. But his voice, when he spoke, was surprisingly gentle.

"Lucy," he waited until she looked at him, her face still pressed against my shoulder. "Your grandparents were sick because they lost their daughter -your mother. They were overwhelmed with grief, just like everyone who loved your parents. But none of that was your fault. And I promise you,they never blamed you. They were grateful you survived." "That's right," I added softly, wiping tears from her flushed cheeks. "When we lose someone we love, sometimes our bodies show our sadness in physical ways. Your grandparents collapsed because losing your mother was the hardest thing they'd ever experienced. But having you - knowing that a piece of their daughter lived on in you - that gave them hope." Lucy hiccupped slightly, her crying beginning to ease. "But I still can't...I don't know how to talk to them yet."

"That's okay," I assured her. "You take all the time you need. There's no rush, no pressure. They love you, and they'll wait until you're ready."

She nodded against my shoulder, exhaustion finally overtaking her. As her breathing evened out into sleep, I looked up to find Howard watching us with an expression I couldn't quite read.

"I had no idea," he said quietly, his voice tight with controlled anger."All this time, she's been carrying this burden... and Margaret..." He broke off,jaw clenching.

"We know now," I reminded him softly, still stroking Lucy's hair. "And we can help her heal."

I caught Howard's gaze in the dim light of the car.

"Yes," he said quietly, his voice carrying a gentle warmth that made my heart flutter."We will."
###Chapter 38: Annie...Could You Hold Me?

Howard's POV

I reviewed the documents on my tablet, waiting for my mother's arrival.Annie was upstairs with Lucy, their gentle voices occasionally drifting down through the quiet house. The familiar warmth of their presence did little to ease the tension coiling in my chest. After today's revelations about Lucy's burden of guilt, certain conversations could no longer be postponed.

Mother's arrival was announced by the precise click of her heels against the floor. She entered with her usual regal bearing, every movement calculated to project authority. The slight arch of her eyebrow told me she already had an agenda of her own.

"Howard." She settled onto the sofa, smoothing her skirt with practiced elegance. "You wanted to discuss Lucy?"

I set my tablet aside, studying her carefully. Something in her tone made me wary. "Yes, there are some matters we need to address."

"Interesting timing," she mused, a familiar glint in her eye that usually preceded her more calculated moves. "I was just speaking with Catherine earlier today."

I waited, knowing where this was heading but choosing not to make it easier for her. "She happened to see you at lunch." Mother's pause was deliberate,her smile taking on a sharp edge. "With Annie Baker, of all people." "According to her, it looked rather... intimate for an employer-employee relationship." The tension in my jaw tightened imperceptibly. "Is that why you're here,Mother? To discuss office gossip?"


"Darling, you know I only want what's best for you and Lucy." Her voice dripped with manufactured concern. "The Morgan family has been very patient,but-"


"Did you tell Lucy it was her fault?" The words cut through her carefully constructed facade.

Mother's composure wavered for just a moment. "I beg your pardon?"

"The yacht accident." My voice remained deadly calm. "Did you tell a five-year-old child that her parents' death was her fault because she wanted to see dolphins?"

"Howard-"

"Answer the question."

Mother's chin lifted slightly. "Sometimes children need to understand the consequences of their actions."

The surge of cold fury that swept through me was almost overwhelming."Consequences?" I stood. "A freak storm that no one could have predicted was somehow a *consequence* of a child's innocent request?"

"You're being dramatic," Mother waved a dismissive hand. "I merely pointed out-" "That her grandparents' collapse was her fault too?" The ice in my tone made her flinch. "That they might die because of her?" "They were in critical condition," she defended. "The shock of losing their daughter-"

"Was not Lucy's fault." Each word fell like a hammer. "And you knew exactly what you were doing when you put that burden on an already traumatized child."

Mother's facade finally cracked. "Everything I've done has been to protect this family's interests! The Morgan merger-"

"Is irrelevant." I cut her off. "Would you like to see Lucy's psychological evaluations? I wonder what a family court judge would make of a guardian who deliberately traumatizes a child in her care."

"Are you threatening me?" Mother's voice held a note of disbelief.

"No." I met her gaze steadily. "I'm informing you that things are going to change. Your interference in Lucy's life, and in my personal choices, ends now."

"Howard-"

"This isn't a negotiation, Mother. It's a notification." I moved to open the door. "I appreciate your past support of the company. But regarding Lucy,and my personal life - your input is neither required nor welcome."

Mother rose, her composure brittle. "You're making a mistake."

"The only mistake was letting you influence Lucy's care for this long." I held the door. "Goodnight, Mother."Only when she left did I allow my shoulders to slump, moving to stand before the windows. The city lights blurred as I pressed my forehead against the cool glass, trying to process the magnitude of what Lucy had been carrying all these years. I heard Annie's soft footsteps but didn't turn around.

"What happened?" Her gentle voice carried across the room.

The vulnerability in my next words surprised even me. "Annie... could you hold me?"

She crossed the room without hesitation, wrapping her arms around me from behind. "It's okay," she murmured, one hand rubbing soothing circles on my back.

I turned in her embrace, burying my face in her shoulder. Her familiar scent helped anchor me as the evening's emotions threatened to overwhelm. After a long moment, I pulled her closer, holding her with perhaps too much force, but she didn't protest.

We stood like that in comfortable silence until my breathing evened out.When I finally lifted my head, Annie's eyes held nothing but warmth and understanding.

As Annie's arms loosened around me, I found myself reluctant to let the moment end. Her presence had a way of settling the chaos in my mind,bringing clarity where there had been only fury and confusion.

"Annie." Her name escaped before I could second-guess myself. She pulled back slightly, but stayed close enough that I could still feel the warmth of her presence."Hmm?" "I'd like you to consider..." I paused, choosing my words carefully. "Being more than just colleagues. More than friends." Surprise flickered across her features, followed by something softer, more complex. She took a shaky breath. "Howard... what about your mother?Margaret has made it very clear what she thinks of me."

The mention of my mother stirred something fierce in my chest. After today - afterlearning what Margaret had done to Lucy, the guilt she'd placed on an innocent child's shoulders - my voice came out with quiet intensity.

"My mother will no longer dictate the happiness of this family." The steel in my tone surprised even me. "I've allowed her influence to hurt Lucy once. I won't make that mistake again."

Annie's eyes widened slightly at my declaration. She twisted her hands together, a gesture I'd come to recognize as a sign of internal conflict. "It's not just your mother, Howard. I just started at Howard Technologies,and with everything that's happening with Lucy's therapy..." She glanced away,her voice growing softer, less certain. "The timing isn't... I mean,I should focus on..."


Her words trailed off into silence, and something in her expression made me suspect there were deeper reasons she wasn't voicing. The slight tension in her shoulders, the way she seemed to be struggling to find the right words-it felt like she was holding something back.

"Annie, if there's something else-" But before I could finish, she was already backing away. "I should check on Lucy," she said quickly, already turning toward the stairs."Goodnight,Howard." I watched her hurried retreat, the words I'd wanted to say dying in my throat. The speed of her departure only confirmed my suspicion that there was more to her hesitation than just work and timing. But whatever those reasons were, she clearly wasn't ready to share them.

For a long while, I stood in the darkening room, letting the silence settle around me. The house felt emptier somehow, despite knowing both Annie and Lucy were just upstairs. Finally, I moved to my study, needing the familiar comfort of work to distract me from the hollow feeling in my chest.

My jaw clenched as I pulled out my phone. If I couldn't address the hollow feeling in my chest or the questions left unasked, I could at least handle other matters. The call connected after one ring.

"Tomorrow, before school starts." My voice carried an edge of suppressed emotion. "I want everyone at that school to know exactly what Sarah Johnson has done."
###Chapter 39: Rage

Sarah's POV

The vase shattered against the wall with a satisfying crash, fragments scattering across the floor. That sanctimonious bastard. My hands trembled as I grabbed the crystal paperweight next, feeling its weight in my palm before sending it flying. The destruction did nothing to ease my fury,my nails digging into my palms as rage coursed through me.

"Mommy?" Max's uncertain voice cutthrough my rage. I spun around to find him hovering in the doorway, eyes wide as he took in the destruction.

I forced my features into a reassuring smile. "Everything's fine,sweetheart.Mommy just had a little accident. Why don't you go play in your room while I clean this up?"

Once Max's footsteps had faded down the hall, I collapsed onto the sofa.pulling out my phone with shaking fingers. Caroline answered on the second ring.

"I just sent you the first set of illustrations," I said without preamble, my voice tight with barely controlled fury. "What do you think?"

"The quality is excellent," Caroline replied, professional interest evident in her tone. "Though we'll need a faster update schedule if we want this to gain traction quickly." "Oh, don't worry about that." I pulled up the next panel on my tablet,where I'd sketched a woman who bore a striking resemblance to Annie,abandoning her crying child to climb into a car with a wealthy-looking man. "I have plenty of material to work with. By the time I'm done,everyone will see Annie Baker for exactly what she is - a gold-digging 
homewrecker who abandoned her own child to climb the social ladder."

"And Howard?" Caroline's tone held a note of caution.

My laugh held no humor. "Oh, I have special plans for Mr. Thompson.Everyone's going to learn how the mighty CEO of Howard Technologies uses his position to seduce vulnerable employees. After all, what kind of man lets his ward's therapist move into his house?"

"Sarah..." Caroline hesitated. "Are you sure about this? Howard's reach in Upper East Side circles is significant. After this morning..."

"After this morning, what choice do I have?" I snapped, the memory of those sidelong glances and whispered conversations at school still burning.
"You should have seen how they all treated me at pickup. Howard actually told everyone about what happened with Philip and Brian-how I supposedly plotted to replace Annie from the start." My fingers clenched around the phone. "He made it sound so calculated, so cold. Asif everything I did for Brian, all the love I showed him, was just part of some scheme."

"Sarah..." Caroline's tone was careful. "You did encourage Brian to reject Annie, and you did pursue Philip quite... deliberately."

"You don't understand," I cut her off, my voice passionate. "I was Philip's first love-his true love." I gripped the phone tighter. "I'm the one who truly understands Philip, who knows what he needs. Brian deserves to grow up in a home with his father's real soulmate. Everything that happened was meant to be - I was just helping fate along." The half-truths came easily after so much practice. But now Howard had twisted everything, making me sound like some kind of calculating predator. "The way those women pulled their children away when I walked past..." My fingers clenched around the phone. "Now none of the mothers will let their children have playdates with Max. Even the ones who used to praise my parenting skills suddenly have 'other commitments'when I call."


"The timing is unfortunate," Caroline agreed diplomatically.

"Don't even get me started on that." I pulled up another sketch, this one showing a businessman who resembled Howard in a compromising position with his secretary. "If Howard Thompson thinks he can just destroy my reputation and get away with it, he's about to learn exactly how wrong he is."

"The illustrations are compelling," Caroline admitted. "But we'll need to be careful about the release strategy. Maybe start with something less...explosive?"

I considered this as I added shading to the panel where Not-Annie was literally stepping over her crying child to reach for a dliamond necklace."Fine. We'll begin with subtle character establishment. But I want readers invested before we really twist the knife."

"And what about Philip?" Caroline's question made me pause. "Won't this risk exposing your...arrangement?"

My hand stilled over the tablet. She had a point-Philip's reaction was the one variable I couldn't entirely predict. Which meant I needed to see him.Now. Philip looked up froma stack of documents as I entered his office, his expression shifting from annoyance to resignation as he recognized me. "Sarah." He set down his pen with deliberate care. "This isn't a good time."

"It never is." I sank into one of his visitor chairs, letting my shoulders slump slightly. Years of experience had taught me exactly how to play this - not too desperate, but just vulnerable enough to appeal to his protective instincts. "But I didn't know where else to go."

Philip's jaw tightened, but he gestured for his assistant to close the door."What's wrong?"

"Everything." I let my voice crack slightly. "Howard Thompson has been spreading rumors about me at Lucy's school. Horrible things. Now none of the other mothers will let their children near Max. Do you know what that s doing to him? To be suddenly isolated, treated like he's toxic?"

"What kind of rumors?" Philip's tone sharpened with interest.

I dabbed carefully at my eyes, smudging my makeup just enough to look authentic. "He revealed everything about how I came into Philip's life-making it sound like I deliberately used Brian's vulnerability, like I calculatedly positioned myself in your life. You know how cruel the Upper East Side circle can be - they're treating me like I'm some kind of manipulator."

"And aren't you?" Philip's question was mild, but his eyes were sharp.I straightened,letting real hurt flash across my face. "How can you say that? After everything we've been through?" My voice dropped to a whisper."I know I made mistakes, but I never meant to hurt anyone." It was the closest to honesty I'd come with him in months. "This is pure character assassination, and you know why Howard's doing it."
 
 "Because of Annie!" I couldn't quite keep the bitterness from my voice.′′H3s trying to clear the field for her, make sure there's no competition for his affections. And he's using my son as collateral damage!"

Philip's expression grew more reserved. "Sarah..."

"Don't you dare defend him," I cut in. "You of all people should understand what's at stake. If Howard Thompson thinks he can just destroy people's reputations without consequences-"

"Sarah, listen to me." Philip's voice took on that maddeningly reasonable tone I hated. "Howard Technologies is a critical business partner. We have several important collaborations in progress."

I felt my carefully constructed expression falter for just a moment. "So you're saying business matters more than what he's doing to your son?"

"What I'm saying," Philip leaned back, studying me with an oddly detached look that made my skin prickle, "is that this is a personal matter between you and Howard. I can't risk our professional relationships over private grievances."

"Private grievances?" I let my voice crack slightly. "He's systematically destroying my reputation!"

"Perhaps," Philip's tone grew cooler, "you should consider why he felt the need to do so."Something in his voice made me pause. This wasn't the usual Philip who would rush to smooth things over, to keep everyone happy. This was...different. More distant. Like he was finally seeing through some of my carefully constructed facade. I swallowed hard, recalculating. "I understand," I said softly,letting my shoulders slump in defeat. "You're right, of course. The business relationship needs to come first. I'll... handle this myself."

Philip nodded once, already turning back to his laptop. But I caught the slight tension in his jaw, the way his fingers hesitated over the keys. He might be choosing business over me now, but I could work with that.After all, I'd built my entire life on making people see what they wanted to see.


"Thank you for listening, at least," I added quietly as I stood to leave.painting on a brave smile. Let him think I was gracefully accepting defeat.It would only make my next move more effective.
###Chapter 40: Mother Would Be Horrified

Annie's POV

The gala had been a triumph, but the true victory was the way Howard hadn't left my side all evening. As we finally returned to the penthouse, the silence of the home felt like a reward.

Howard loosened his tie, the sharp, formal lines of his tuxedo softening as he relaxed. He turned to me, his expression unreadable in the shadows of the foyer.

"Tonight was perfect," I said, stepping closer to him.

"It was," he agreed, his voice dropping an octave. He reached out, pulling me into the circle of his arms. "But the best part is knowing that tomorrow, and every day after, I get to wake up and see you."

He leaned down, his kiss tasting of the champagne we'd shared and the bright future ahead of us. It was a long, slow kiss that spoke of deep-seated desire, yet it was tempered by a profound respect. There was no rush, no urgency born of insecurity—only the calm, steady heat of a love that had been tested and proven.

As he led me toward our bedroom, his hand firmly but gently holding mine, I felt a surge of pure, unadulterated happiness. The ghosts of Philip and the pain of the past were finally gone. In their place was a man who saw me, who valued me, and who loved me with a strength that matched my own. Whatever challenges lay ahead, I knew we would face them with the same unity we felt tonight. Our story wasn't just about surviving; it was about thriving, together.
###Chapter 41:Why Not

Howard's POV

In the morning, Annie and I walked Lucy to preschool, following our usual path along the maple-lined street. At the entrance, Lucy turned to wave goodbye to us - she's really doing better. I couldn't help but smile at this small yet meaningful change, silently thanking Annie for all she had done to help Lucy come this far.

Just as we were about to turn and leave, a little girl with pigtails approached Lucy, and I held my breath, remembering all the times Lucy had dissolved into panic at such moments. Lucy tensed - I could see it in the slight stiffening of her shoulders - but instead of running away like she used to, she managed a hesitant nod followed by a gentle shake of her head. My heart raced as I watched the interaction unfold, fighting the urge to step in and protect her. Though the exchange was awkward,it was worlds away from the completely withdrawn child of a few months ago who would have been hiding behind my legs by now.

"Do you think she's finally starting to open up?" Annie asked softly beside me.

"We'll see how it goes," I replied, watching Lucy disappear into the building.

"She's been practicing, you know," Annie shared with a gentle smile. "Both last night and this morning. I heard her whispering 'good morning'and thank you' over and over in front of the mirror." "One small step at a time," I nodded, thinking about how far Lucy had come from those early days of silent tears and blank stares. Every tiny gesture forward felt like a victory. The car was already waiting when we walked back. As Annie slid into the backseat beside me, her perfume filled the enclosed space, bringing back memories of that night on the terrace. The night after my heated argument with mother, when Annie had found me there. The warmth of her embrace as she quietly stood with me, understanding without words needed.


The drive to the office was unusually quiet. Usually, we'd discuss Lucy's progress or upcoming projects, but today the silence felt charged with unspoken words. I caught Annie's reflection in the window-she was gazing out at the passing city, a slight blush coloring her cheeks when our eyes briefly met in the glass.

These precious moments alone with Annie had become increasingly rare since hiring a full-time driver. It had seemed like the right decision at the time - making things more convenient for Annie and Lucy. But now,every second we spenat together in this confined space felt electric, charged with unspoken words and stolen glances.

Since that night after my fight with mother, I'd caught Annie looking at me when she thought I wasn't watching, her eyes dark with an intensity that made my breath catch. The way she'd quickly look away, a slight flush coloring her cheeks, only made the attraction more maddening.These moments of connection, however brief, sent my heart racing every time. As we approached the office building, I found myself drowning in possibilities and what-ifs. Perhaps I could suggest lunch today,somewhere private where we could finally address this magnetic pull between us. The tension was becoming unbearable - surely she felt it too? After a morning of back-to-back meetings and endless document reviews,I allowed myself a brief respite. Standing by the floor-to-ceiling windows of my office, I stretched my stiff shoulders, attempting the exercises Thomas had demonstrated. The morning sun warmed my face as I rotated my neck,trying to release the tension that seemed permanently lodged there these days.


A knock at the door interrupted my impromptu exercise session.

"Come in," I called out automatically, still focused on working out a particularly stubborn knot in my shoulder.

"Documents requiring your signature, Mr. Thomnpson," Susan's voice made me pause mid-stretch. My longtime secretary stood in the doorway,barely concealing her amusement at catching her usually composed boss doing what must have looked like awkward yoga moves.

"Thank you, Susan," I straightened my tie, suddenly struck by a thought."May I ask you something?"

She paused by my desk, documents still in hand. "Yes, Mr. Thompson?"

I hesitated for a moment, then decided to press on. "What's your impression of me? Personally.Be honest."

Susan hesitated, clutching the documents to her chest. Though she'd been my secretary for years, I rarely asked her personal questions.

"It's alright," I assured her, gesturing for her to take a seat. "I value your candid opinion." She placed the documents on my desk and sat down, still looking uncertain. "Well.,. at first glance, you're quite... attractive, sir. The type who could sweep any woman off her feet, if you wanted to." She blushed slightly."Some even assumed you'd be the type to have a different date every night."

I kept my expression neutral, though inwardly I was somewhat surprised by this perception. "I see. Please continue."

"But you're rather... mysterious," she chose her words carefully."We've never seen you with anyone at the office. There are even rumors..." She trailed off, clearly uncomfortable.

My fingers stilled on the pen I'd been holding."Go on."

"Some wonder if you might not be interested in women at all, though," she glanced at me quickly, "they say you look a bit too... rough for that."

I met her gaze steadily, my face betraying nothing of my thoughts."An interesting theory."

"And in the office, you've always been quite serious, almost aloof. Though lately," she added with a slight smile, "you've become more approachable.Like laughing at Jenkins' terrible joke during last week's board meeting -that really surprised everyone."

I set down my pen and leaned back slightly, considering her words. The office gossip was more detailed than I'd anticipated. "Thank you for your honesty,Susan." The rumors weren't entirely unfounded - I had withdrawn significantly from social life. My mind drifted to the past, when I used to date frequently, maintaining a steady stream of social engagements that kept the gossip columns interested. But everything changed after Lucy's parents'accident. The last time I'd been intimate with anyone was that night with Annie... Since meeting her. I'd changed in ways I hadn't even realized. If Susan thought I was charismatic, why had Annie pushed me away? The question nagged at me, refusing to be dismissed.

As the lunch hour approached, I found myself heading toward Annie's studio,rehearsing what I might say to finally break this tension between us. But through the glass walls, I saw Catherine Morgan already there,perched casually on the edge of Annie's desk. The mere sight of her made my jaw clench.


Susan had mentioned Catherine's increasingly frequent visits to Annie's studio lately. Though Annie had dismissed my concerns, insisting there was nothing to worry about, something about Catherine's presence here set my teeth on edge. Perhaps it was the way she carried herself with that calculated grace, or how her eyes always seemed to hold a hint of mockery.

Annie looked up as I entered, her smile warm but slightly nervous.She started to say something, but Catherine smoothly cut in.

"Join me for lunch?" she asked Annie, standing up with that perfect poise that only irritated me further.

"No." The word left my mouth before I could stop it, sharp and decisive.

Annie turned to me, surprise evident in her widened eyes. "Why not?"
###Chapter 42: Lunch Battle

Howard's POV

The word hung in the air like static before a storm. I watched Catherine's perfectly shaped eyebrow arch upward, her lips curving into that knowing smile I'd grown to detest. Catching myself, I softened my tone. "What I mean is - Annie hasn't tried Morton's new lunch menu yet. I was just about to suggest it."

Catherine's fingers drummed once against Annie's desk. "What a coincidence. That's exactly where I was planning to take her."

"Perfect timing then," she continued before I could object, turning to Annie with practiced warmth. "We can all go together. The more the merrier,right?"

Annie's fingers went to her pendant - that telltale sign of uncertainty I'd grown familiar with. Her eyes darted between us before settling somewhere in the middle distance. "I suppose that would be nice?"

"Let's take my car," Catherine announced, already gathering her things.

I opened my mouth to suggest separate vehicles, but Catherine had smoothly maneuvered Annie toward the door, their arms linked as if they were old friends. I followed them to the parking lot, watching Catherine guide Annie into the front passenger seat while I was relegated to the back like an afterthought. "The limestone facade is original to the building," she was saying,her arm still linked with Annie's as they walked toward the entrance. I followed behind, my hands flexing unconsciously at my sides as I watched them disappear through the revolving door. The leather seat felt unusually stiff as I settled in. Through the rearview mirror, I caught glimpses of Annie's profile as Catherine launched into what seemed like an endless stream of conversation. I followed them in, my hands flexing at my sides as I watched Catherine's arm still linked with Annie's. "Speaking of design work," Catherine's laugh carried through the car."Annie, you must tell me more about that portfolio you showed me yesterday. The color choices were absolutely inspired."

"Oh, thank you," Annie's response came with a small chuckle that made something in my chest tighten. "I was actually a bit nervous about that particular combination."

"You shouldn't be. I've seen a lot of portfolios in my time, but yours has such a fresh perspective," Catherine's voice was warm with calculated charm. "We really must discuss how we could apply that aesthetic to some of my upcoming projects."


I checked my phone again, the screen a blur of unread messages.The conversation flowed around me, Catherine's voice rising and falling in practiced cadence as she drew Annie into one topic after another. Each traffic light seemed to stretch longer than the last, and I found myself increasingly aware of my position in the backseat, watching this carefully orchestrated performance play out before me.

By the time we reached Morton's, I had counted seventeen stoplights and checked my email folder three times. I quickly moved to open Annie's door,but Catherine was already there, helping her out while pointing out the restaurant's architectural details with exaggerated interest. "Mr. Thompson," the maitre d' greeted me. "Your usual table?"

"Actually," I stepped forward, "we'd like one of the corner booths."The intimate four-person booths would give me a chance to sit beside Annie.

But Catherine was already moving,guiding Annie toward a round table by the window. "The lighting's much better here, don't you think? Perfect for discussing those new designs you were showing me."

I watched Annie slide into her seat, Catherine claiming the chair beside her before I could move. The waiter appeared with menus, and I took the seat across from Annie, trying to catch her eye.

"The duck here is exceptional," I said, leaning forward slightly. "It's prepared with a honey glaze that-"

"Annie, you have to try their seafood," Catherine cut in. "They do this amazing Chilean sea bass. It would pair perfectly with that project we were discussing."

At lunch, I tried bringing up the upcoming company retreat. "I was thinking about the team building activities..."

"Oh Annie," Catherine chimed in with an exaggerated gasp,"speaking of activities, you absolutely have to hear about my weekend in the Hamptons.Picture this - champagne, yacht parties..." Annie laughed, drawn into Catherine's animated storytelling while my own conversation starter died mid-sentence. I pushed the salmon around my plate, waiting for another opening. "Annie, how's the new project coming along?" I tried again, reaching for the salt shaker near her hand. "Oh! Allow me," Catherine swooped in, plucking it up with theatrical flair.She held it just out of my reach while pretending to season her own food first. "Perfect timing - Annie, you simply must tell me more about your vision for the Henderson account..."


My fork clinked against the plate as I set it down perhaps a bit toofirmly.Catherine caught my eye over her wine glass, her lips curving into a playful smirk. She was clearly enjoying this little game of keep-away

As we finished lunch, I watched Annie stirring her iced tea, my mind racing with both desire and frustration. Catherine's presence was suffocating - a constant, immovable obstacle between Annie and me. But more than that, her smug atttude was driving me crazy. Two birds with one stone,perhaps?

"I should head back to the office," I said casually, though my heart was pounding with anticipation of what I planned to do next.

"Oh, I'm off today," Catherine's sickeningly sweet voice cut in. "I can keep Annie company." Her eyes met mine in silent challenge, and something in me snapped.Perfect.

Annie shifted uncomfortably, her fingers nervously playing with her necklace."Well..."

My hand moved toward my glass, adrenaline coursing through my veins.One "accidental" spill would serve Catherine right for her interference, and give me a moment alone with Annie. The perfect crime. But Catherine wasn't as oblivious as I'd hoped. Justas my hand "slipped,"she smoothly sidestepped, a knowing glint in her eye. To my horror, the lemonade splashed across Annie's pristine white blouse instead. "Oh my!" Annie jumped up, her face flushing. "I need to clean this up.Excuse me." She hurried away from the table.

I watched Annie's retreating figure, mortified at how my plan had completely backfired.

"Well played," I growled, glaring at Catherine's satisfied expression.

Catherine took a delicate sip of her drink, her smile holding a hint of amusement that made my stomach turn. "You really thought you could outmaneuver me, didn't you?"

"Come now, Howard," shetook a delicate sip of her drink. "We both know what you were trying to do - get me out of the way to be alone with Annie.
Perhaps with a dash of revenge thrown in?"

I remained silent, my jaw tightening.

"Would you like to know why your little schemes always fail?" Catherine leaned forward,her voice taking on an almost intimate tone.

"Do tell," I replied dryly, trying to mask my discomfort.

"Love," she stated simply, her eyes locked on mine. "Your feelings for Annie are painfully obvious. Every look, every gesture... they give you away. And that,Howard,has become your weakness."

"Speaking of which," she continued, "how are things progressing between you two?" "That's none of your concern," I snapped. "Oh?" Catherine raised an eyebrow. "What if I told you I could help?" My pride screamed at me to tell her to get lost, but Annie's face flashed through my mind - that pained look when she'd rejected me, the way she d avoided my eyes. The memory still stung. And here was Catherine,dangling answers in front of me like bait...

After a moment's hesitation, I sighed. "I... I suggested taking our relationship beyond friendship. She turned me down. I still don't understand why."

"Fascinating," Catherine's eyes gleamed. "I could help you understand why.I'm quite good at reading people, especially women."

"Help?" I scoffed, though part of me was intrigued. "What's the catch?"

Her smile turned triumphant. "Simple enough. I want in on your game development department. I've heard some interesting things about your latest project."
###Chapter 43: New Friends

Lucy's POV

I remember the first time I met Penny. It was last week, when she came to our class as a new student. Her mommy had pretty red hair just like Ariel,and Penny was wearing a sparkly blue hairband that made her look like a princess.

Ms. Mitchell told her to sit at the empty desk next to mine. Most new kids look at me funny when they find out I don't talk, but Penny was different.She just smiled and whispered, "I like your butterfly necklace! It looks like it's about to fly away!"

That made me feel allwarm inside, like when Annie gives me goodnight hugs.During snack time that day, Penny shared her animal crackers with everyone, making funny voices for each cookie before eating them. Her lion cookies went "RAWR!" and her elephant cookies made trumpet sounds.She even left a giraffe cookie on my desk with a note that had a smiley face drawn on it.

Now, a whole week later, Ms. Mitchell was writing words on the big whiteboard. I like watching the letters appear - they look like tiny dancing friends holding hands to make words. Some kids were whispering and giggling, but I stayed super quiet, like always.

"Who can spell 'butterfly'?" Ms. Mitchell asked in her happy voice.

"Who can spell 'butterfly'?" Ms. Mitchell asked in her happy voice. Lots of hands shot up like rockets, with lots of "Me! Me!" but Penny's hand was the highest. Her pigtails were bouncing up and down like they were doing a happy dance too. They remind me of the ribbons Annie uses to tie my braids. Penny's been really good at spelling since her first day-she told everyone it's because she reads lots of storybooks with her mommy every night.

"B-U-T-T-E-R-F-L-Y!" Penny got it right! She's really good at spelling.When she gets something right, she doesn't act all show-offy like some kids do. She just smiles like sunshine.


After class, Penny came to my desk. Usually when kids come close, I get that icky scared feeling in my tummy. But Penny was different. She had a special kind of smile, like Annie's.


"Hi Lucy!" she whispered, like she knew loud noises sometimes make me jump. Then she did something super sneaky - she pulled a candy from her pocket! It was wrapped in pretty red paper that sparkled in the sun.

"It's strawberry flavored!" she said. "It makes your whole mouth happy!"

Dr. Marshall says it's okay to accept nice things from nice people. But candy still feels a bit scary, so I shook my head just a teeny bit. Instead of getting mad like other kids do, Penny just kept smiling!

"That's okay!" She put the candy back in her pocket like it was no big deal.Then her eyes got all sparkly. "Oh! Do you like Disney?"

Before I could even think about nodding, she started twirling around like a princess! "I know ALL the songs from 'The Little Mermaid'!" She tried to stand like Ariel on her rock, but she looked more like a baby duck learning to walk. It was so silly I couldn't help smiling!"Wanna play princess at recess?" She was bouncing like a happy bunny now. "The jungle gym can be our castle! I'm usually Ariel, but sometimes I'm Mulan 'cause she knows kung fu!" Then she started doing these funny kicks that made her almost fall over.It was the silliest thing ever! My smile got even bigger.
"We can pretend we're under a magic spell, just like Ariel when she couldn't talk!" Penny said.


That made my heart feel warm and fuzzy. Penny didn't think I was weird for not talking - she made it into a fun game instead!




When exercise time came, the sun was playing peek-a-boo with the clouds.
We all lined up on the playground like ducks in a row. Our gym teacher
was at te front, showing us how to stretch like tall trees.

Then the principal came rushing over like she was in a big hurry. She whispered something in our teacher's ear, and his face got all serious.She bent down to whisper something in our teacher's ear that made his happy face turn all serious and worried - the same way Uncle Howard's does when he gets important phone calls.

"Keep following the music, children! I'll be right back!" our teacher said in that fake-cheerful grown-up voice they use when something's wrong. Then he hurried away with the principal, their shadows dancing on the wall as they disappeared down the hallway.
The peppy exercise music kept playing through the big speakers,but everything felt different now. Tommy, with his wild orange curls that always reminded me of the carrots in Uncle Howard's garden,started doing robot moves instead of stretches, his arms moving all jerky like a broken toy. Emma and Jenny, the twins who always wore matching butterfly clips in their dark pigtails, huddled together in their special corner, giggling behind their hands and pointing at how silly everyone looked. David, whose glasses were too big for his face and kept sliding down his nose like a tiny sled on a snowy hill, spun in wobbly circles until he got so dizzy he almost crashed into the wall. His untied shoelaces flew around like jump ropes as he twirled.

Penny was right next to me, turning our normal exercises into a beautiful ballet dance. Her ponytail swished back and forth as she twirled,reminding me of the way Annie's hair moves when she's painting. Every few seconds, Penny would spin around to make silly faces at me - puffing out her cheeks like a chipmunk storing acorns, or scrunching up her nose like she'd smelled something stinky. A tiny bubble of laughter wanted to escape from my throat, but it got stuck like always.

"Lucy, watch out!" Penny shouted suddenly.

I turned around just as Max came running toward us, his face all scrunched up mean. But before he could reach me, Penny jumped between us, her arms spread wide like a shield.

"Leave Lucy alone!" Penny's voice was loud and brave, even though she was smaller than Max.


Brian, who was exercising nearby,saw what was happening and ran over too."Stop being mean, Max!" he said, standing next to Penny.

Max looked at Penny and Brian, then at all the other kids watching.His face got all red like a tomato, and he stomped away making angry elephant noises.

"Are you okay?" Penny asked me, her eyes big with worry.I nodded,touching my butterfly necklace from Annie. "Max is just a grumpy gus," Penny declared,going back to her silly exercises. "Let's pretend we're dancing butterflies instead!" She started twirling around, making her arms flutter like wings. Some other kids joined in, including Brian, though he said he wanted to be a dragon butterfly because that was cooler.

When we did our exercises again, I had Penny on one side doing her butterfly dance, making everyone giggle with her silly moves. She kept making up new animals to be - a jumping kangaroo, a wobbly penguin, a stretching giraffe. Each one was funnier than the last!

Later,when we lined up to go back to class, I touched my butterfly necklace from Annie. Penny was still making silly penguin waddles next to me, and I could feel giggles wanting to bubble up in my throat. Not just giggles - words too! Big words and little words, happy wwords that wanted to jump out and play with Penny's penguin sounds.

My throat felt tickly, like when you want to sneeze but can't. I opened my mouth a tiny bit, just to see what would happen. Nothing came out yet,but that was okay! Maybe tomorrow I could try making penguin sounds with Penny. Or maybe the next day I could tell her that her monkey faces are the funniest ever!
###Chapter 44: The Doll Therapy Plan

Annie's POV

I was reviewing children's psychological counseling materials on my tablet,trying to focus despite the lingering awkwardness from Catherine's visit.She'd been dropping by almost daily since our coffee chat last week, fuIl of questions about gaming industry insights. Today she'd spent nearly two hours discussing potential game concepts, brushing aside my suggestion that she try an entry-level position first to learn the basics. Her sudden interest in my work was flattering, but something about it felt..off.

Howard appeared at my studio door, carrying two wrapped boxes.My heart did that annoying little skip it had started doinglately,despite my firm resolution to keep things professional between us. His confession from the other night still echoed in my mind, making our every interaction feel charged with unspoken words.

"Still here?" he asked, his voice carefully neutral as he set the boxes on my desk. The forced casualness in his tone told me he was just as aware of our new awkwardness as I was.


"Catherine just left," I said, looking up from my research. "Another discussion about gaming projects. She's... very enthusiastic."

Howard's jaw tightened at the mention of Catherine, a muscle working in his cheek. "I've noticed she's been spendinga lot of time here latelY There was something in his tone that made me want to explain. "She seems genuinely interested in gaming, though I've suggested she start with actual industry experience first. It's not exactly a field you can just jump into..." "Especially with no background," Howard agreed, his expression unreadable. He gestured to the boxes, clearly wanting to change the subject."The dolls arrived. Want to see them?"

My heart quickened as I carefully opened the first package. Inside was an exquisitely crafted doll bearing Edward Parker's likeness - the gentle eyes,the warm smile, every detail captured perfectly. The second doll was equally remarkable, Mrs. Parker's elegant features rendered with the same care.


"What made you think of using dolls?" Howard asked,studying my reaction.


"Children often express themselves better through play," I explained,arranging the dolls carefully. "Especially after trauma. I thought if we started small..."


"With the dolls as a safe first step?"

I nodded. "And later,maybe we could add small two-way radios inside.Make them interactive, but in a way that feels naturaI to Lucy."

"For her to practice speaking?" Howard leaned against my desk,intrigued.

"Exactly. Building confidence gradually until she feels secure enough to talk to people she trusts." I bit my lip. "What do you  think?" "I think it's brilliant." His voice carried quiet conviction. "Whatever equipment you need, just let me know." He glanced at his watch."We should head to the school - it's almost pickup time." I carefully wrapped the dolls back up, already imagining Lucy's reaction to them. The drive to the preschool was quiet, filled with that same charged awareness that seemed to crackle between us lately. As we pulled up to the school, the playground was bathed in afternoon sunlight. Lucy was in the small garden with the same golden-haired little girl we'd noticed this morning. The girl was putting on quite a show, her pigtails bouncing as she twirled around the playground.

"Look, I'm Ariel without her voice!" she mouthed dramatically, before attempting an elaborate swimming motion that nearly sent her sprawling.She caught herself just in time, turning her stumble into an exaggerated bow that had Lucy's shoulders shaking with silent laughter.

Lucy tugged gently at my sleeve as we approached. "That's Penny," she whispered, so softly I had to lean down to hear. "She knows al the Disney songs..."

We watched as Penny transformed the playground into her personal stage,moving seamlessly from one Disney princess to another. Lucy remained her captivated audience, eyes bright with delight at each new performance.The other parents gradually collected their children, but there was no sign of anyone coming for Penny.

After nearly forty-five minutes, the playground had almost emptied. Penny kept performing, though I noticed her occasional glances toward the school gate. The teacher on duty was checking her watch with increasing frequency.

Finally, a harried-looking man in a rumpled suit rushed through the gate."Penny! I'm so sorry, sweetheart. The meeting ran late..."Watching him, I felt a familiar ache in my chest. How many times had Philip made similar excuses? The memory of Brian waiting alone at school flashed through my mind, but I pushed it away. This wasn't about my past-this was about Lucy finding her first real friend. Penny was mid-twirl as Belle when she spotted him. "Daddy!" She ran to him, still maintaining her princess persona even as she hugged him.

"Same time tomorrow, Lucy!" Penny called out with a theatrical wave. "TIl bring my tiara!"


Lucy gave a tiny wave back, her eyes following Penny until she disappeared into her father's car. I watched Lucy's face carefully,recognizing the mix of joy and anxiety there - the happiness of finding a friend warring with the fear of letting someone new into her carefully guarded world. It reminded me of those first tentative days when she'd started to trust me.


Even after Penny had gone, Lucy lingered by the garden gate. The afternoon sun caught her hair, and for a moment, she looked so much like the photos I'd seen of her mother that my breath caught. How far we'd come from those first silent days, and yet how far we still had to go.

Howard's presence beside me was a steady warmth, and I found myself grateful for his quiet support. Despite the awkwardness between us lately,we were united in this - in wanting to help Lucy heal.

"Ready to go home, sweetheart?" I asked gently.

Lucy nodded, but her expression remained wistful as we walked to our car.I could almost see the thoughts turning in her mind, weighing the desire to spend more time with her new friend against her lingering fears. Once settled in the backseat, she spoke up in her soft voice: "Can we stay a little longer tomorrow?" "To watch more of Penny's shows?" Howard asked, catching her eye in the rearview mirror. Lucy nodded, fingers playing with her butterfly necklace.

"What if we invited Penny to visit sometime?" Howard suggested.

Lucy's eyes lit up before uncertainty crept in. I reached back to squeeze her hand. "We can take it slow, sweetie. Whatever makes you comfortable."




After Lucy's evening therapy session, Howard brought out the dolls.Her reaction was immediate - recognition and longing flashing across her face before she shyly looked away.

Taking my hand, she led me upstairs to her room. I sat in the corner while she settled on her bed with the dolls, arranging them carefuly in front of her.

For a long moment, she just looked at them. Then, in a tiny voice: "I'm scared." Her fingers brushed Mrs. Parker's cheek. "Like at the hospital today..."

I remembered how she'd hidden behind Howard when we'd visited her grandparents at the hospital that morning, unable to face them despite clearly wanting to.

"Why are you scared, sweetheart?" I asked softly.

"That they won't like me anymore," she whispered to the dolls. "Because I hide." "Your grandparents love you very much," I reminded her gently. Lucy hugged the dolls close. "I love them too," she murmured. "Miss them. She curled up with the dolls until her breathing evened out in sleep.I covered her with a blanket, careful not to disturb the dolls still held protectively in her arms.


Howard was waiting in the hallway. The tenderness in his expression as he looked at Lucy made my heart flutter. One step at a time. I reminded myself.For now, this peaceful moment was enough - the first small victory in helping Lucy find her voice again.
###Chapter 45: You're So Nice to Me

Annie's POV

My heart raced as I approached EdwardI Parker's townhouse, the package of dolls heavy in my arms. Each step felt weighted with responsibility-these weren't just toys, but potential keys to unlocking Lucy's voice.Howard's hand brushed my elbow briefly as I hesitated at the door,the slight contact steadying my nerves.

Edward's face lit up with genuine warmth when he opened the door."Annie, Howard! What a wonderful surprise." His eyes crinkled with authentic pleasure as he ushered us in. "I've been hoping to hear more about Lucy's progress -Howard mentioned in his last email that she's been responding well to therapy."

As we settled in the sitting room, I noticed how he seemed more energetic than duringour previous visits, eagerly leaning forward in his chair. My hands moved as I explained the plan, demonstrating how we'd incorporate the two-way radios, showing how Lucy could use the dolls as a safe bridge between her silent world and the voices she longed to share.With each detail, I watched hope slowly kindle in Edward's eyes. Edward's eyes widened with delight as he reached for the miniature version of himself, examining every detail with growing amazement."
These are incredible!" he exclaimed, a broad smile spreading across his face."The craftsmanship is extraordinary. Lucy must love these."

His enthusiasm was contagious, and I found myself smiling as I explained,"We believe these dolls could help Lucy feel even more connected to you and Mrs. Parker. Children often express themselves more freely through play, and given how well she's been responding to creative therapy..." "You think this might help her feel more comfortable around us?" Edward's eyes sparkled with hope and enthusiasm. "I know she can't speak to us yet, but just seeing her respond to you both, watching her slowly open up..it gives me such hope."

"It's all about building on her progress," I explained, encouraged by his positive response. "The dolls can create a comfortable space for her to express herself. We've noticed that she's starting to communicate more with her new friend Penny, and we believe these dolls might help extend that progress to family interactions."


"That makes perfect sense," Edward nodded eagerly. "And the way you've captured our likenesses... it's like we could be right there with her,waiting patiently until she's ready." He chuckled warmly, though his eyes grew thoughtful. "I just want her to know we're here for her, however long it takes."

"She knows," Howard added gently. "We're helping her understand that she's loved and supported, that the accident and everything that followed wasn't her fault."

"Of course it wasn't," Edward said firmly, his voice full of grandfatherly love. "She was just our precious girl, excited about dolphins..." He smiled at the memory, though his eyes glistened slightly. "What matters is that she's healing now, thanks to you both. Even if she can't tell us directly, we can see the difference in her eyes."

"Which is why these sessions are so important," I pressed on, giving him a moment to collect himself. "The dolls can help her work through those feelings in a safe environment, surrounded by people who love her."

"Whatever you need," Edward straightened, that familiar Parker strength reasserting itself. "Just tell me how I can help." Catherine breezed into my studio in her usual afternoon visit, settling herself on the edge of my desk with practiced grace. Today, though, there was something different in her expression - a hint of calculated curiosity.

"Annie," she began, her tone deliberately casual, "I couldn't help but notice...things seem a bit tense between you and Howard lately. Is everything alright?"

I studied her for a moment, considering how to respond. The memory of Howard's confession still lingered, making every interaction with him feel charged with unspoken words. But Catherine's sudden interest in my personal life made me wary.

"Actually," I countered, meeting her gaze steadily, "I've been wondering something myself. How exactly did you convince Howard to let you join the gaming division? He's usually quite particular about experience requirements."

Catherine's fingers drummed once against my desk - a nervous tell I'd begun to notice. She reached for my water glass, buying time with a long sip. "Oh, you know how these things work..." she said vaguely,her usual confidence wavering slightly.

"No, I don't know," I pressed gently. "Why don't you tell me?" Her hand moved to her earring - another tell I'd spotted during our coffee shop chat. After a moment of uncomfortable silence, she suddenly brightened. "Oh! Speaking of office politics, you won't believe what happened in the dev team last week!" "Remember Jake from UI/UX?" she continued hurriedly, clearly relieved to change the subject. "Well, he and his girlfriend just broke up, and he actually demanded she repay him for everything he ever spent on her."

Despite my awareness of her deflection, I found myself drawn in by her animated storytelling."Everything?"

"Everything," she confirmed, leaning forward conspiratorially. "Down to a two-dollar bottle of water and a one-dollar piece of paper. Five years together, and his total expenses came to barely over a thousand dollars,while she'd spent over twenty thousand on him."

"That's..." I searched for a diplomatic response while processing this glimpse into office politics.

"Pathetic, right?" Catherine laughed, but there was an edge to it. "But wait,it gets better. He tried to win her back with flowers, and when she refused,he tried giving them to me instead!"

"And?"

"I turned him down flat. Knowing him, he'd probably try to bill me for them later." She rolled her eyes, but I caught the slight hurt beneath her bravado. "Then this new guy Joey took them and had the nerve to say I was just jealous. Me! Jealous of dollar-store flowers!"

Something in her tone made me reach for my tablet. "Sounds like you need better flowers," I suggested, pulling up a local florist's website. Catherine's carefully maintained sophistication cracked as I selected their most expensive rose arrangement. "Annie,you don't have to..." "Consider it a welcome gift to the gaming division," I smiled, completing the order and watching emotions play across her face. Without warning, Catherine's head dropped to my shoulder, her voice suddenly small.

"You're so nice to me," she whispered.

The moment stretched, raw and uncertain, until her phone buzzed. She jumped up, mask sliding back into place as she checked the time. "Oh! I'm late for a meeting. Thanks for the flowers, Annie.Really."

I watched her hurry away, thinking about how beneath her polished exterior was someone still trying to figure out who she wanted to be. The afternoon light was starting to fade - time to pick up Lucy.




The playground was bathed in golden late-afternoon light when we arrived. Penny was in full performance mode,spinning and swooping through an elaborate rendition of "Under the Sea." Her pigtails flew as she twirled, narrowly avoiding disaster with each enthusiastic movement.

"Look, I'm Sebastian!" she announced, scuttling sideways like a crab before launching into the song's chorus. Lucy watched from nearby, her usual tension melting away as she followed Penny's joyful chaos. I noticed how she'd begun to mirror some of Penny's movements.

Howard checked his phone with a sight frown. "Still no sign of her father?
I shook my head, watching the playground slowly empty as other parents collected their children. "School office says another late meeting."His protective instincts kicked in immediately. "Ill have my assistant coordinate with him. We can take them both home for now." The girs settled into the backseat, Penny's theatrical storytelling filling the car with warmth. Each tale earned a tiny smile or nod from Lucy - more response than I'd seen her give anyone her age.

"And then the princess had to be really brave," Penny was saying,gesturing grandly, "because sometimes being brave is scary but you do it anyway!"


I watched their interaction through the rearview mirror,noting how naturally they'd fallen into this friendship. But something about Penny's constant performance, her need to always be "on," made me wonder.

"Penny,sweetheart," I kept my voice gentle, "who usually picks you1 up from school? Besides your dad?"

The question seemed innocent enough, but Penny's endless stream of chatter suddenly stopped. Her hands, which had been painting stories in the air, dropped to her lap and began fidgeting with the hem of her dress.

Beside her, Lucy studied her friend's face with the kind of quiet understanding that came from knowing what it meant to carry hurt inside.Then, with unexpected courage, she reached over and took Penny's hand.
###Chapter 46:Sue Peterson

Annie's POV

I watched Lucy's shoulders tense as Thomas demonstrated the next exercise. But before her usual anxiety could take hold, Penny swooped in with her boundless energy.

"And now, we're all brave explorers climbing Mount Everest!" Thomas quickly adapted, transforming the mountain climber exercise into an adventure. His eyes darted between the girls,gauging their reactions.

Penny dropped to her hands and knees, crawling across the mat with exaggerated stealth. "Lucy, quick! I think I see a snow leopard!" She pointed at a yoga block, her voice dropping to a theatrical whisper that made Lucy's lips twitch upward.

The change in Lucy was subtle but unmistakable. Her movements,usually stiff with self-consciousness, began to mirror Penny's playful approach.Each time Penny added a silly flourish to the basic exercises, Lucy's shoulders relaxed a fraction more.


"Now we're swimming through the clouds," Thomas continued, leading them into arm circles. "Like the flying fish ín 'The Little Mermaid'!" Penny's face lit up. She launched ínto "Under the Sea," managing to stay surprisingly on beat despite her dramatic gestures. Her pigtails whipped through the air as she pretended to conduct an imaginary orchestra while maintaining the e xercise rhythm. Lucy's silent smile shook her small frame. I caught Thomas's eye,sharing his amazement at how naturally Penny had breached Lucy's carefully constructed walls. Even more remarkable was how Penny would pause between movements, waiting for Lucy to catch up, adjusting her pace without drawing attention to it.

Howard appeared in the doorway, the usual tension in his shoulders softening as he took in the scene. I forced myself to look away from how his rolled-up sleeves revealed strong forearms, focusing instead on Penny's voice.

"Did you see that. Mr. Thompson?" She called out between breaths."I'm teaching Lucy how to be a mermaid-tree-explorer!"

"I see that," Howard's voice carried unusual warmth. "You're quite the instructor."


Penny beamed with pride. "That's 'cause my mom says you gotta make everything fun," she explained, wobbling through a balance pose. "Even the hard stuff!"




Later, while Lucy changed clothes, I sat with Penny as her endless energy finally began to quiet. Her feet swung rhythmically against the bench,a steady drumbeat of contained motion.

"You really love performing, don't you?" I offered gently. "Mom and Dad took me to see 'The Little Mermaid' when I was four,"Penny's usual animation softened into something more wistful. "It was magical- all the lights and music and dancing. That was the last time we all went out together before..." Her feet stilled. "Now Dad's always busy with Clara and the new baby. He says theater tickets are too expensive anyway." She twisted the hem of her shirt. "Clara says I'm too loud when I practice my singing at their house."

My chest tightened atthe familiar pain in her voice. "That must be hard."

"Mom works really hard at her computer job so I can take dance classes,"Penny straightened slightly. "But when I stay at Dad's, I always miss the Saturday morning ones because Clara says they have other plans." Her shoulders hunched. "Dad just nods when she says that."

The echo of Brian's hurt during the early days of Philip's new relationship made my hands clench. I deliberately relaxed them before speaking. "Sometimes grown-ups don't handle changes very well."

"Mom says it's not my fault," Penny's voice grew very small. "But sometimes I think if I was quieter like Clara wants, maybe Dad would..."She shook her head, plastering on a bright smile that didn't reach her eyes."But it's okay! Lucy likes my performances. She never tells me to be quiet."

"You know what I think?" I matched her serious tone, watching her spine straighten. "I think you and Lucy understand each other perfectly.Sometimes the best friends are the ones who let us be exactly wvho we are."

Her answering smile was genuine this time. "That's what Mom says too!She says we shouldn't change who we are just because other people don't understand us." Howard offered to drive Penny home, his thoughtfulness catching me off guard once again. As we pulled up to their apartment building, I noticed a tall woman waiting outside. Her auburn hair was pulled back in a neat ponytail, and despite the late hour, her crisp blazer and pencil skirt spoke of the kind of polished professionalism I recognized from my da navigating corporate life. Though exhaustion showed in the slight tension around her eyes, she carried herself with quiet confidence.

Before any of us could speak. Penny tumbled out of the car, her energy somehow still boundless. "Mom! We did yoga but it was really exploring and Lucy smiled at my Ariel impression!"


"Tm Annie Baker," I stepped forward, extending my hand."And this is Howard Thompson. Penny and Lucy have become quite close."

"Sue Peterson," she shook my hand firmly, then Howard's. "I can't thank you enough for looking after Penny today. When the school called about my meeting running late..."

"It's no imposition," I kept my voice casual, remembering my own challenges as a single mother. "Lucy's really blossomed with Penny around.I could pick them both up after Penny's morning dance class tomorrow?They could spend the afternoon together."

"Tomorrow's Saturday!" Penny tugged at her mother's sleeve. "Please can I go play with Lucy again? Please?"

Sue's professional mask wavered, practicality warring with pride. "We really shouldn't impose..."

"Mom!" Penny persisted. "Lucy needs me. She's teaching me to be quiet sometimes, and I'm teaching her to be loud sometimes. It's a fair trade."

Sue's startled laugh caught in her throat. "Is that so?". "Plus," Penny added with pure child-logic, "Annie makes the best hot chocolate. With tiny marshmallows and whipped cream." "The secret ingredient is cinnamon," I stage-whispered, watching Sue's shoulders relax incrementally.

"Well." Sue's smile softened with genuine warmth, "who am I to argue with tiny marshmallows?" She checked her phone quickly. "The dance class ends at eleven tomorrow..."


"Perfect," I said. "TIl pick her up then."

As we drove away, Howard's fingers drummed thoughtfully against the steering wheel. "Sue Peterson," he broke our comfortable silence. "Top of her class at MIT, brilliant system architect. Making twice what her ex-husband does, but her current company's losing her because they won't offer flexible hours for school pickup."

I studied his profile, recognizing the particular set of his jaw that meant he was solving a puzzle. "Howard..."

"We've been looking to strengthen our development team," his fingers stilled on the wheel. "Someone with her expertise in secure systems...especially with the new government contracts coming up..."

"And the flexible hours?" I already knew his answer, but wanted to hear him say it.


"We have that parent-friendly initiative rolling out next quarter anyway."his casual shrug couldn't hide the satisfaction in his voice. "Might as well start with someone who'd make it worth the investment." Warmth spread through my chest at this glimpse of the man behind the CEO facade. "You're a good man." His quick glance carried more weight than his light tone. "I have my moments."
###Chapter 47: I Would Start Practicing My Witing
 Brian's POV

My hands gripped the cold iron bars of the Thompson estate gates,knuckles turning white as I watched Annie and Lucy in the garden. Lucy's arms moved in graceful arcs, perfectly mimicking Annie's butterfly pose from their exercise routine. A familiar ache spread through my chest -Annie used to read me stories just like she was doing with Lucy now.

"That's perfect, sweetheart!" Annie's voice carried through the evening air as she guided Lucy through what looked like a therapy session. The lttle girl responded by throwing her arms around Annie's neck, nearly toppling them both. My throat tightened as Annie caught Lucy, their shared laughter echoing across the lawn. I used to hug Annie like that too,before Sarah taught me it was wrong to love my "boring" mom.

A tall man emerged from the house-Howard Thompson. I'd seen him in Dad's business magazines. His usual stern CEO expression melted as he watched them.Something in the way he looked at Annie made my stomach twist - it wasn't the calculating way Dad looked at her when he wanted to manipulate her feelings.Lucy grabbed Howard's hand while reaching back for Annie, forming a perfect chain as they disappeared inside. A real family. A complete family.

My mind flashed back to the night everything changed. I'd asked Annie if she and Dad could get divorced, complaining about her making me eat special food while Sarah let me have McDonald's. I didn't understand then why she looked so hurt when she found my iPad with the "My Perfect Family" group chat. I was too excited about having Sarah as my "fun mom" who didn't care about my food allergies or health issues. I remember the morning after,how I'd thrown my special breakfast across the kitchen, screaming that Annie had ruined everything by disbanding my family group chat. How I'd hidden behind Sarah at school, pretending not to know my own mother when the teachers almost called the police.The memory of Annie's devastated face as I declared Sarah was my real mom now made me feel sick.


How many times after that had I rejected Annie's carefully packed lunches,demanding pizza like Max got to eat? How many times had I seen her trying to explain my allergies to Sarah, only to be dismissed as overprotective? How many times had I complained about Annie's "stupid rules" while she fought alone to keep me healthy?

My fingers unclenched from the bars, leaving half-moon imprintsin my palms. Now Annie had a new daughter who adored her, who didn't pull away from her hugs or throw tantrums when she tried to help with homework. She had a man who looked at her like she was precious,not an obligation. She didn't need the son who'd thrown her love back in her face.


"Mama," the word escaped in a broken whisper before I could stop it.

Behind me, the family driver shifted uncomfortably. "Shall we head back?"

I squared my shoulders,swallowing against the burning in my throat."Take me to Grandma Betty's instead."

Betty was father's mother. She wwas very fond of me. Grandma's fingers fumbled with her keys when she saw me on her doorstep. "Brian? What are you doing here,sweetheart?" I forced my lips into what I hoped was a normal smile. "I missed you,Grandma."

Her eyes narrowed, catching the tremor in my voice. "Have you eaten dinner yet?"

I shook my head, and she practically flew into action. "I'Il make your favorite noodles. Extra dumplings, just how you like them."

Following her into the kitchen, I watched her gather ingredients with practiced efficiency. Her movements were so like Annie's - the way she hummed while chopping vegetables, how she checked the water temperature with her wrist. The familiar gestures made something crack inside my chest.

"I miss Mama," The words burst out between sobs I couldn't contain anymore. "I miss her so much!"

Grandma's knife clattered against the cutting board as she rushed to wrap her arms around me. "Oh, sweetheart. We can call her right now, ask her to come see you-"

"She doesn't want me anymore!" My hands clutched at Grandma's sweater."She has Lucy now, and Howard, and they're happy without me!"

"That ungrateful woman!" Grandma's voice turned sharp. "After everything our family did for her, how dare she abandon her own son-"

"No!" I jerked away, surprising us both. "It's not her fault, Grandma. It's not..." My voice broke as I remembered Annie's face the day I'd told her I was going to live with Dad and Sarah. She'd knelt down to my level,hands trembling as she helped pack my favorite toys. *"Whatever makes you happy, sweetheart,"* she'd whispered, but now I understood the pain behind her brave smile.


"Grandma?" I tugged at her sleeve, desperate to change the subject before the memories overwhelmed me. "Could you maybe... get me a tutor?"

"A tutor?" She blinked at the sudden shift. "Whatever for?"

My fingers tracedl invisible words on the counter. "I want to study harder.Especially writing. I need to practice my writing."

Like the birthday cards Annie sent every year, carefully addressed in her beautiful handwriting. The ones I'd crumpled up without reading, too angry to see the love in every perfectly formed letter.




Dad's voice crackled through my phone later that night, distracted as always. "Are you coming home?"

"No." The word came out harder than I'd intended.

"Well, I have good news," he continued, not noticing my tone. "I bought Sarah and Max a new place. They've already mnoved out, so you don't have to worry about-"

My hand tightened arounad the phone. "You bought them a house? As a gift?"

"That's right." Pride colored his voice. "A nice penthouse on Pak Avenue." Something cold settled in my stomach as I remembered Annie's tin studio,crammed into the corner of our old living room. She'd complained, just made the most of the small space, hanging my draw alongside her work.

"Dad?" I kept my voice carefully steady. "Can I have a house too?"

"Of course, son!" His laugh was warm and generous - the laugh he used when he was in a giving mood. "Which one would you like? That new development in Tribeca is quite nice-"

"I want our old house." The words fell like stones between us. "The one where Annie and I used to live."


The silence stretched until I could hear Dad's breathing change. "Brian..."

"You never bought Annie anything," My voice cracked on the truth I'd been too young to see. "Not a car, not jewelry, not even that art studio she wanted. But you bought Sarah a penthouse."

"That's different-"

"Why?" The question burned in my throat. "Because you love Sarah more than you ever loved Annie?"

I hung up before he could answer, my hands shaking as I stared at Annie's number in my contacts. There were so many things I needed to tell her.That I was sorry. That I understood now. That I missed her sugar cookies and bedtime stories and the way she always knew exactly when I was pretending not to be scared of thunderstorms. But the words wouldn't come. Instead, I curled up in Grandma's guest bed,pressing my face ínto a pillow that still held traces of Annie's jasmine perfume from her last visit. Tomorrow, I decided as tears slid silently into the fabric, I would start practicing my writing. Maybe when I could make the letters as beautiful as Annie's drawings, I'd be brave enough to write down all the words stuck in my throat. Maybe then she'd understand that her first butterfly was finally learning to spread his wings.
###Chapter 48: It's a Big Day for All of Us

Howard's POV

I woke up early on Saturday morning. Since weekends were Lucy's break from physical therapy, I let hersleep in while I handled company emails.

At eight, I went to wake her. She'd curled up with her Parker dolls, and after washing up, emerged in her carefully chosen pink outfit.

"You have to stay home today," she told her dolls, adjusting their positions.
"We're going out, but I won't forget about you."

Once Annie joined us, I explained that I'd given the staff the day off. "It'll just be me driving today."

Lucy threw her arms around me. "So Howard, it'sgoing to be just us as a family taking Penny out?"

"That's right."

"Yay!" Lucy exclaimed. "It's been forever since it was just our family!"

Her words struck me - not just Howard and Annie as separate caretakers,but a family unit. Annie's eyes met mine, reflecting the same warm surprise I felt.

We drove to Brooklyn to pick up Penny. Sue Peterson looked startled when she answered the door, dressed professionally but clearly stressed. 
Howard's POV

I woke up early on Saturday morning. Since weekends were Lucy's break from physical therapy, I let hersleep in while I handled company emails.

At eight, I went to wake her. She'd curled up with her Parker dolls, and after washing up, emerged in her carefully chosen pink outfit.

"You have to stay home today," she told her dolls, adjusting their positions.
"We're going out, but I won't forget about you."

Once Annie joined us, I explained that I'd given the staff the day off. "It'll just be me driving today."

Lucy threw her arms around me. "So Howard, it'sgoing to be just us as a family taking Penny out?"

"That's right."

"Yay!" Lucy exclaimed. "It's been forever since it was just our family!"

Her words struck me - not just Howard and Annie as separate caretakers,but a family unit. Annie's eyes met mine, reflecting the same warm surprise I felt.

We drove to Brooklyn to pick up Penny. Sue Peterson looked startled when she answered the door, dressed professionally but clearly stressed. "I'm so sorry," she said, checking her watch. "There's an emergency at work-a system crash. I need to go in." "We'd be happy to take Penny for the whole day," I reassured her, exchanging a meaningful look with Annie.

Once Penny joined us, we headed to an indoor playground in Midtown at the girls' request. While they played, I noticed something immediately different about Lucy's behavior. Rather than staying close to Annie as usual, she followed Penny to the climbing structures. Several times,Lucy opened her mouth as if to speak, only to close it again, communicating through gestures instead.

Annie noticed too. "She wants to talk to Penny so badly," she murmured."You can see it in her face."

I nodded. "She's capable of speech - we know that - but something's still holding her back with peers."


After observing them, Annie turned to me. "I have an idea. What if we made a doll for Penny too? If Lucy can practice talking through a 'Penny doll' first, it might make the transition to speaking with the real Penny easier."


The idea immediately resonated. "That could work," I agreed. "Could you design something?"

Annie quickly sketched a design on her tablet - a doll with Penny's distinctive pigtails and bright eyes, captured in a mid-twirl pose that embodied her energy.

"Something like this," she explained. "We'd want to capture that spark Lucy responds to."

"I'll arrange for the doll to be made," I promised, "and take care of the communication system at the same time."

While Annie supervised the girls' lunch, I stepped away to call Susan Moore.

"Mr. Thompson?" she answered promptly.

"Susan, I need to order another doll," I said directly. "This one needs to resemble Lucy's friend Penny - Annie will send over the design. It should have the same two-way communication functionality as the Parker dolls."

"I'll make it a priority," Susan replied. "When would you need it delivered?"


"As soon as possible," I stated. "We're making significant progress with Lucy's therapy, and this could be an important next step."

"Understood. By the way, we've been in contact with Sue Peterson, as requested."

"Oh?"

"She was fired this morning after the system crash. Her company decided to 'restructure."


I wasn't surprised. "That company's leadership can't recognize talent when it's right in front of them."

"Several companies have approached her. After comparing offers, she's leaning toward accepting our position."

"Double her previous salary," I decided. "Make sure the flexible hours arrangement is explicitly stated in the contract."

After the call, I purchased three high-quality two-way radio sets,then drove to Edward Parker's townhouse. I explained about upgrading from voice recordings to two-way communication, demonstrating the radio system I'd brought.

"This will allow you and Mrs. Parker to speak directly with Lucy through the dolls," I explained.


Edward's hands trembled slightly as he held the device. "This means so much. To be able to hear her voice, to respond in real time..."

"It's just the next step," I said. "Eventually, once Lucy is comfortable with this communication, we'd like to arrange for you to visit her in person."

"Whatever she needs, at whatever pace works for her," Edward agreed eagerly.




When we returned to the estate, Lucy immediately headed for the stairs,eager to reconnect with her Parker dolls.

"Wait, sweetheart," I called1. "There's something special about your dolls I want to tell you about."

Lucy turned, curious. "What is it, Howard?"

I knelt to her level. "We've made some changes to your dolls. They have a speciaI device inside now that will let them talk back to you - really talk,not just play recordings."

"So if I say something to them... they'll actually answer what I ask?"

I nodded. "That's right. But remember, they're still dolls. The voices you'll hear are your grandparents speaking through them."

Her eyes widened. "My real grandparents? Not just recordings?" "Your real grandparents," I confirmed. "And we're making a special doll that looks like Penny, too. That way, you can practice talking to her even when she's not here."

Lucy's face lit up. "I want to try it right now!"

As Lucy bounded upstairs, Annie moved beside me. "You've been busy today,"she observed.

"Just keeping all the pieces moving forward," I replied. "Sue will be joining Howard Technologies with double her previous salary,Edward was receptive to the communication system, and the new Penny doll has been ordered."

Annie squeezed my hand. "You always handle everything so efficiently."

"I'm motivated by important outcomes," I said simply.

Together,we paused outside Lucy's bedroom door. Through the opening,we saw Lucy sitting cross-legged with the Parkerdolls before her.

"Grandpa?" she asked tentatively.

After a brief pause, Edward's voice emerged. "Yes, sweetheart, it's me."

Lucy gasped. "Grandma?" she tried next.

"I'm here too, darling," came the gentle response.

"This is amazing!" Lucy exclaimed. "Can you really hear everything I say?"

"We can hear you perfectly," Edward assured her. "And we've missed hearing your voice so much."


What followed was a flood of words from Lucy. She told her grandparents about her exercise routines, reading lessons, and friendship with Penny.With each sentence, her voice grew stronger.

"Annie helps me practice my letters every day," she was saying. "She never gets mad when I make mistakes, and she draws beautiful pictures for our stories." After a pause, she added, "She's really special to me. Sometimes...sometimes I pretend she's my real mom. Is that okay?"

Annie stiffened beside me, tears streaming down her face. I gently guided her away from the door.

In the hallway, I wiped her tears. "This is all because of you, Annie," I said softly. "Your therapy approach, your patience with her-you made this breakthrough possible."

Annie shook her head modestly. "We all did this together. The way you immediately supported the doll idea and made it happen so quickly...I couldn't have done it alone."

I watched her brush away the last of her tears. Something about this moment - seeing the results of our combined efforts -felt profoundly satisfying.While part of me had hoped for more after my confession,I realized that what we had built together was already extraordinary:a partnershíp centered around Lucy's healing that had created its own kind of intimacy.

"We make a good team," I said simply, and was rewarded with Annie's genuine smile. "Yes, we do," she agreed. Later, Annie glanced toward Lucy's room. "She wore herself out with all that conversation. I've never heard her speak so much at once." I nodded, feeling content with what we'd accomplished. "It's a big day for all of us."

Annie looked thoughtful for a moment. "Howard, you seem... different tonight. More at peace."


I considered her observation. "I think I am. Seeing Lucy find her voice,watching how far we've all come together - it puts things in perspective."

"How so?" Annie asked, her voice gentle.

"I'm grateful for where we are right now - all of us. There's no rush to change anything. This... what we have, it's working."

Annie's expression softened with what looked like relief. "I feel the same way.Goodnight.Howard."
###Chapter 49: Dave's Confrontation

Annie's POV

Monday mornings at Howard Technologies always carried a certain energy.
I'd just settled into my studio space when Catherine Morgan swept in without knocking, her designer heels clicking purposefully across the floor.

"Annie!" she exclaimed, dropping into the chair across from me. "You won't believe what happened over the weekend!"

I set down my tablet with a bemused smile. These impromptu visits had become routine. "Good morning to you too,Catherine."

She leaned forward conspiratorially. "Remember Joey that I told you about last time?"


I recalled our previous conversation. "The one who accepted those roses from the cheap guy?"

"Yes!" Catherine's eyes lit up. "Well, you won't believe what happened next.That cheap jerk asked Joey to help him pay back his ex-girlfriend!"

I blinked in surprise. "Wait, what?"

"I know!" Catherine threw her hands up. "Can you believe the audacity?Joey makes good money-she's saved over $200,000 through hard work.Did he really think she'd just hand it over because he asked?"

"That's.,. quite presumptuous," I agreed, finding myself drawn into her drama.

Catherine made a face of theatrical disgust. "And when she refused, he immediately threatened to break up with her." "Seriously?" I couldn't help my incredulity. "That's ridiculous."

"Right?" Catherine nodded vigorously. "But it gets worse! Joey actually paid him, and then-get this-he came to *me* asking for money!"

The story grew increasingly bizarre as Catherine detailed how the man had come to her after Joey paid, only to be soundly rejected. When she finished,she dramatically flung herself sideways, resting her head on my lap. The unexpected intimacy caught me off guard.

"Catherine?" I asked gently, noticing how her usual animation had suddenly dimmed.

"Mmm?" She looked up at me, her expressíon suddenly serious.

"Did something happen? You seem... different today."

Catherine sighed. "A friend confessed his feelings to me this weekend," she admitted quietly. "I turned him down."

I waited,sensing there was more.

"And now I'm wondering if I made a mistake," she continued, her voice smaller than I'd ever heard it. "Annie, what would you do if you were me?
11

The question caught me off guard. I considered my answer carefully "If it were me," I began slowly, thinking of my own complicated feelings toward Howard, "I'd probably turn him down too. After all, I just got divorced, my life is in pieces, and I'm trying to rebuild. I probably wouldn't deserve him right now." Catherine studied my face for a long moment before a mischievous smile tugged at her lips. "That's what I thought you'd say," she murmured,seemingly satisfied with my response.

She sat up abruptly, smoothing her suit and instantly transforming back into the polished socialite. "Well, I should let you work. Thanks for the chat,Annie!"




After work,Howard and I spotted Sue Peterson pacing anxiously near the entrance.


"Annie, Howard," she called, walking quickly toward us. "Could you take Penny to your place for a while? Something's come up that I need to handle."

Howard's gaze sharpened. "Is it about your ex-husband?"

Sue's surprised expression confirmed his suspicion before she nodded. "Yes,how did you-"


"Just an educated guess," Howard replied evenly. "What's happening?"

Sue ran a hand through her hair. "Dave's demanding to see Penny tonight.He claims I'm keeping her from him, which is ridiculous considering he rarely bothers to pick her up when he's supposed to."

Lucy emerged from the school building just then, spotting us and running toward me with a smile. She slipped her small hand into mine with the easy trust we'd built over these past months.

"I could join you," Howard offered, his tone matter-of-fact. "If anything happens, I can provide support." Sue hesitated, her gaze moving from Howard to me, clearly wondering if I'd be uncomfortable.

"Would that be a problem?" I asked gently, understanding her hesitation.

Sue bit her lip. "I wouldn't want to impose-"

"You wouldn't be," I assured her. "We'd be happy to help."

Relief washed over her face. "I would appreciate the backup," she admitted."Dave can be... difficult."

"Then it's settled," Howard stated with finality. "We'll accompany you."




An hour later, we were settled at a corner table in the restaurant.Howard had arranged for us to sit several tables away from where Sue would meet her ex-husband. Lucy and Penny sat beside me, studying the children's menu with serious expressions.

"I think this looks good," Penny pointed at a colorful pasta dish, her pigtails bouncing with enthusiasm.

Lucy nodded, her eyes brightening at the illustration.

While Howard helped the girls with their selections, I kept a discreet eye on Sue and Dave. Her ex-husband was conventionally handsome, but his aggressive posture and cold eyes reminded me uncomfortably of Philip during our worst arguments.


"What right do you have to keep Penny from me?" Dave's voice carried despite his attempt to keep it low.

"Maybe because you never show up for her," Sue replied firmly. "I've been busy with work," he snapped defensively.

"Aren't you unemployed now?"

Dave's face reddened. "That's temporary. I have prospects."

"The same prospects you've had for six months? Meanwhile, I'm working full-time while raising our daughter."


"I'm her father," Dave hissed. "I have rights."

"Rights you've barely exercised," Sue countered. "When was the last time you attended a parent-teacher conference? Or remembered what foods she's allergic to?"

"If you're going to be difficult, I'll take you to court."

Sue remained surprisingly calm. "Go ahead. The court will ask Penny who she wants to live with. They'll investigate which home environment better supports her development."

Dave's aggression faltered. He softened his voice, changing tactics. "Sue, be reasonable. I just want time with my daughter."

"Now you do," Sue replied coolly. "After months of broken promises.Do you know how many times Penny's waited for you? How many times I've had to explain that Daddy's not coming-again?"

Sue stood, clearly finished with the conversation. "I won't let you disrupt her life because you suddenly feel like playing father."

As she turned to leave, Dave grabbed her wrist. "We're not finished-"

Howard was on his feet immediately, his movement smooth and purposeful. I quickly engaged the girls in conversation to distract them.
 "Mr. Peterson," Howard's voice carried quiet authority. "I believe Ms.Peterson was leaving. You might want to release her wrist."

Dave looked up, startled. "This is a private conversation."

"It was," Howard agreed pleasantly, though his eyes remained cold. "Until you physically restrained someone. That crosses from 'private conversation'into 'potential assault."

Dave's grip loosened, and Sue pulled her arm away.

"Who are you?" Dave demanded, embarrassment mixing with anger.


"Howard Thompson." The name registered immediately with Dave,whose expression shifted from anger to calculation.

"This isn't your business, Thompson."

"I disagree," Howard replied evenly. "Ms. Peterson works for me now, and her well-being is certainly my business. As is ensuring Penny has a stable environment."


Howard turned to Sue. "Ready to leave?"

Sue nodded with evident relief. As they walked back to our table, Dave watched with barely contained fury.

Outside,Howard pulled Sue aside for a brief conversation while I helped the girls into the car. Through the window, I could see Sue nodding in response to Howard's words. When they joined us, Howard's expression was serious. "Dave will likely continue his harassment. He's clearly using Penny as leverage, particularly since Sue provides financial support to his new family." "What can she do?" I asked, concerned for both mother and daughter.

Howard outlined the security measures already in place at Sue's residence and at Howard Technologies. "The office has strict access controls,and your apartment has decent security. But remain cautious elsewhere."

"I could assign company security personnel," he added. "Given your role on our secure projects, it would be justified."

"Thank you," Sue said softly. "I don't know how to repay you both."

Howard shook his head. "There's no need. You're a valuable employee,and Penny's friendship has been significant for Lucy's progress."

As we drove away, I glanced at Howard's profile, struck by the quiet strength he'd displayed. Behind his matter-of-fact tone,I recognized what he tried to disguise - genuine care and protection for those he considered part of his circle.

*I'd probably turn him down too. I just got divorced, my life is in pieces...*My own words to Catherine floated back.

Howard had stepped in tonight without hesitation. And despite all my careful boundaries, I couldn't ignore the flutter in my stomach when Howard's gaze met mine. Maybe that was the most frightening part - not that I was drawn to him, but that I'd begun to imagine what it might be like to let someone in again.
###Chapter 50: Family.

Howard's POV

I tapped my pen against the quarterly reports, pleased that the gaming division-where Annie worked-had grown faster than I'd anticipated.The numbers confirmed what I already knew: bringing Annie on board had been the right decision, professionally and personally.


A knock interrupted my thoughts.

"Come in," I answered, automatically shifting into the controlled tone I used for business matters.


Susan Moore entered, closing the door with a soft click. "Mr. Thompson, I wanted to inform you that the therapeutic dolls you ordered for Lucy have arrived." Her expression shifted slightly. "The manufacturer mentioned something I thought you should know."

"Go on."

"They're inquiring if you'll need additional dolls in the future. Apparently,the workshop is facing some financial difficulties." Susan's voice remained professional, but I detected genuine concern. Her attachment to Lucy's progress had grown alongside everyone else's. "I'm not certaín at this point," I responded thoughtfully. "I should discuss that with Annie first. She's better positioned to assess Lucy's therapeutic needs." Susan nodded, then elaborated, "According to their representative,the small workshop might close down within months. They specifically wanted to check with you because once they shut down, these custom dolls won't be available anymore."

I leaned back in my chair, the beginnings of an idea taking shape. "Let's acquire their workshop."


"Sir?"

"Buy the workshop. Retain their craftspeople as well." The decision crystallized as I spoke. It was the most efficient solution.

Susan looked surprised. "Just for a few therapy dolls?"

I studied her for a moment. Susan was competent, but sometimes missed the broader strategic implications. "You need to think more strategically,Susan."


"In what way?" Her brow furrowed slightly.

"The natural progression is to develop merchandise-specifically dolls and educational toys based on Annie's characters." I laid out my reasoning methodically. "Rather than outsourcing manufacturing later, it's more efficient to own production capabilities now. Additionally, our publishing division will undoubtedly produce other successful children's books in the future."


The acquisition made perfect sense from both a business and personal perspective. The workshop could continue Lucy's therapeutic dolls while positioning us for future merchandise development.

 Susan nodded, her expression shifting from confusion to appreciation."T'll begin the acquisition process immediately." After Susan departed, I returned to the quarterly reports, but my thoughts had alreadyshifted to Annie's studio. It was time to discuss next steps. I found myself pausing at Annie's studio doorway, watching her work intently over her tablet. The sight stirred a complex mix of emotions -pride in how she'd grown from someone rebuilding their life into a confident professional, yet unease at what that growth might mean.

"Howard!" Annie looked up with a smile. "Perfect timing. I just finished the educational designs."

"The team is impressed," I said, keeping my tone measured. "The children respond well to your work."

"That's wonderful to hear."

"Actually, I'm here about something else - we'd like to develop merchandise based on your book characters." I watched her reaction carefully.

Her eyes lit up. "Really? That would be amazing. I've always imagined them as more than just illustrations."

After outlining the basics, Annie turned to her computer. "Look at this,"she said, pulling up her professional accounts. Her following had grown substantially, with parents sharing her work and industry figures reaching out about collaborations.

"Your audience is growing impressively," I observed.

"It still feels surrea1," Annie admitted, "For years, Philip dismissed my illustrations as a hobby. Now I'm getting messages from established publishers."


As she described her expanding opportunities, I studied her profile, struck by an uncomfortable realization. With her growing success and independence, what would keep her connected to Lucy and me? The thought created an unexpected hollow sensation in my chest.

"Thank you for believing in my work," Annie said softly. "I finally feel like I'm rebuilding something meaningful."

I nodded, concealing my internal conflict. "Your talent was always there-it just needed the right opportunity."

What I didn't say: And now that you're finding your wings, I wonder if you'll fly away.




I instructed my driver to take Annie to pick up Lucy from school while I headed to Edward Parker's Upper East Side townhouse. The evening traffic crawled through Manhattan as I mentally rehearsed what I'd say.Annie and I had agreed this morning: Lucy's progress warranted reintroducing her grandparentsinto her daily routine-a calculated risk that could accelerate her recovery or potentially disrupt it.

The door swung open. Edward's eyebrows shot up when he saw me, his hand tightening slightly on the doorframe.

"Howard,"Edward greeted me. "Is everything alright with Lucy?"

"Everything's fine. I have something to discuss regarding Lucy's therapy. Inside, I explained our plan directly. "Based on your daily communications through the doIls, we believe it's time to reintegrate you into Lucy's daily life. We'd like you to stay at the estate."

 Edward's hand moved to steady himself. "You mean... live there? With Lucy?"

"She can communicate through dolls when needed or interact directly when comfortable."


I'd barely finished speaking before Edward called up the stairs."Eleanor!Eleanor,come down,please!"


Mrs. Parker appeared at the top of the staircase, elegant even in her casual home attire. "What is it,dear?"


"Howard has suggested we stay at his estate, to be near Lucy,"Edward explained, his voice catching slightly. "As part of her therapy."


Understanding dawned immediately on Mrs. Parker's face. Without hesitation, she turned toward their bedroom. "I'll start packing immediately. Just essentials, of course."

"Should we pack right now?" Edward asked, looking back at me.

"If you're available, yes. Lucy will be finishing her evening routine soon.and Annie thought it might be easier if you were there when she wakes tomorrow."


The elderly couple moved with surprising efficiency,returning shortly with modest luggage containing just their personal necessities. I helped carry their bags to my car, stowing them carefully in the trunk.

Navigating through evening traffic, I caught glimpses of the Parkers in my rearview mirror. Their clasped hands and synchronized movements spoke of a connection forged through decades-exactly what I found myself wanting with Annie My grip tightened on the steering wheel as I made a decision. "A personal question," I said during the drive. "What's the most effective approach when pursuing someoe you've developed feelings for?"

"You mean Annie, don't you?" Mrs. Parker responded.

I smiled slightly. "Yes."

"Demonstrate reliability and consistency," she advised. "Show her that life with you provides security."

"Show vulnerability occasionally," Edward added. "Annie has remarkable empathy-she'll naturally want to comfort you."

"When selecting gifts, include something for Lucy," Mrs. Parker suggested."If questioned, simply say you thought of her."

"The most important thing." Mrs. Parker concluded as we approached the estate gates, "is patience. Annie's been through significant trauma with her divorce. She'll need time to trust again."

Approaching the estate, my breath caught when I glimpsed Annie and Lucy through the windows. They bent together over Lucy's art supplies,Annie's hand guiding Lucy's smaller one. Something primitive and protective surged through me-a visceral need to safeguard what we'd created here.


"Your advice is appreciated," I said, parking with more force than necessary. "And your participation in Lucy's therapy."

Edward touched my shoulder briefly. "Family supports each other,Howard. And it seems to me we're all becoming family,aren't we?"

*Family.* The word echoed in my mind as I carried their luggage inside.After years of coldly efficient business relationships, Lucy and Annie had reintroduced me to a concept I'd dismissed as irrelevant to my life.
###Chapter 51: A Bridge Built with Dolls

Annie's POV

Through the living room's windows. I watched Lucy and Penny on the lawn while explaining our latest therapy approach to Sue. Lucy moved through her exercise routine with careful precision, while Penny demonstrated her newest dance steps nearby.

"We're developing à specialized approach," I said, spreading the sketches across the coffee table. "The idea is to create a doll that resembles Penny.with the same two-way communication system we've been using with the Parker dolls."

Sue leaned forward, her eyes bright with interest. "That's brilliant.Penny would be thrilled to be part of Lucy's therapy." She glanced out at the girls.
"She's already become quite the interpreter at school. The teachers tell me she instinctively knows when Lucy needs help expressing herself."

I nodded,watching as Penny attempted to teach Lucy a twirl. "Their friendship has been instrumental in Lucy's progress. The way Penny naturally adapts to Lucy's communication style is remarkable."


"It goes both ways," Sue smiled. "Penny's never had such a close friend before.She-" She paused as the sound of tires on gravel caught our attention. Howard's car pulled up to the circular driveway, and I felt my chest tighten as I recognized Edward and Eleanor Parker in the back seat. The moment we'd been preparing for had arrived. "Lucy, Penny," Howard called as he helped the elderly couple from the car.His voice carried that particular gentleness he reserved for important moments. "Come meet Mr. and Mrs. Parker." I watched Lucy's transformation with the careful eye of both therapist and caregiver. Her breathing shifted from the steady rhythm of exercise to something shorter and more controlled. Each step toward her grandparents was measured, her hands clasped tightly in front of her.
Edward's entire body seemed to gravitate toward Lucy, though he maintained the careful distance we'd discussed. I recognized that barely-contained longing; it was the same ache I felt whenever I caught sight of a little boy who reminded me of Brian.
Penny, bless her heart, broke the tension with her natural exuberance."
Want to see my new dance routine?" She was already spinning,her pigtails flying. "I've been practicing!"

Eleanor's careful composure melted into genuine delight. "We'd love to see it.dear."
As Penny launched into an impromptu performance, I noticed Lucy's fingers twitching slightly, unconsciously mimicking the dance moves. But when Edward took a step closer, she suddenly bolted toward the house.Her footsteps echoed on the stairs as she retreated to her room.

Eleanor's face feIl as Lucy disappeared upstairs. "Did we push too hard?Perhaps we should give her more time-"

"Wait," I touched her arm gently, recognizing the pattern from our therapy sessions. "Lucy's not running away. She's probably heading to her room to use the intercom system - it's become her safe space for difficult conversations." Sure enough, the intercom light blinked on moments later. Lucy's voice came through with that particular strain I'd learned to associate with her pushing past her comfort zone. "I'm sorry. I just...I couldn't..." "There's nothing to be sorry for," Edward assured her,though his hands gripped his knees hard enough to wrinkle his perfectly pressed slacks."But I want to talk to you!" Lucy's words burst forth with unexpected intensity. "I try so hard, but sometimes the words get stuck, and I feel like I'm disappointing everyone."

"Lucy," Eleanor's voice wavered slightly, "you could never disappoint us.Not being able to speak sometimes doesn't make you any less precious to us."


"But what if I never get better?" The fear in Lucy's voice was raw,familiar.
"What if I'm always broken?"

"You're not broken, sweetheart," Edward's words carried the weight of absolute conviction. "You're just finding your own way to communicate.And that's perfectly okay."

The sound of small feet on stairs drew our attention. Lucy descended step by careful step, her Parker dolls clutched protectively against her chest. Her face held the same expression I'd seen in the mirror countless times-the look of someone gathering every ounce of courage they possessed.

With deliberate care, she placed one doll beside Edward and the other next to Eleanor. Then, in a voice that barely disturbed the air but shook our world nonetheless, she said, "Grandfather?"

Edward's hand flew to his mouth, his shoulders shaking with suppressed emotion. Eleanor's fingers found his other hand, their shared grip white-knuckled with the effort of holding themselves together.

"I wanted to find you earlier," Lucy continued, each word precise and carefully formed. "But I was scared... scared that not being able to talk would make you sad. Make you not want me."

Eleanor opened her arms, and Lucy hesitated for just a heartbeat before stepping forward.

"We love you exactly as you are, sweetheart," Eleanor said, her voice gentle. "Whether you speak a thousand words or none at all, you're our precious granddaughter."

Edward joined them, his voice rough with emotion. "We're so proud of you,Lucy.So very proud."

Lucy's small fingers clutched at her grandmother's sweater, and I caught a glimpse of her profile-the subtle relaxation in her shoulders that I'd learned to recognize as trust. This was another breakthrough, another step forward in her healing journey.

My phone vibrated in my pocket, breaking the moment. Philip's name on the screen sent an immediate surge of tension through my body.I remembered our last conversation at the café-how I'd finally spoken my truth, how I'd walked away feeling lighter than I had in years.

My first instinct was to decline the call. I'd made my position clear during our last meeting. But something about witnessing Lucy's courage today-watching her face her fears and overcome them-resonated within me.

After everything we'd accomplished today, I felt more centered,more certain of who I'd become. The woman who had once bent herself into impossible shapes to please Philip was gone. In her place stood someone stronger, someone who could face this final ghost from her past without being haunted by it.

I stepped into the hallway, away from the tender family scene unfolding in the living room, and answered the call, "Philip."

"Annie, I need to see you again." His voice carried that familiar note of urgency that used to send me rushing to solve whatever crisis he'd created.

I took a breath and considered what the therapist in me recognized-that clean breaks were better than ragged edges, especially when a child was involved. "Fine," I said, keeping my voice steady. "Text me where we're gonna meet."
I ended the call before he could respond.
###Chapter 52: Cold Coffee

Philip's POV

My finger hovered over the "approve" button for another acquisition deal when Sarah's ringtone interrupted-that pretentious classical piece she'd insisted on setting herself. I caught myself hoping it would go to voicemail.a new reaction that made me pause. When had I started dreading her calls?


"Philip?" Her voice trembled with carefully crafted vulnerability."Something terrible happened this morning."
I pinched the bridge of my nose, exhaustion seeping into my bones."What is it now,Sarah?"
"Your mother-Betty-she came to my apartment this morning." Sarah's voice cracked perfectly on cue. "She just started attacking me, saying the most horrible things about how I'm poisoning Brian against his family."
My fingers drummed against the mahogany desk, a habit I'd developed during particularly trying board meetings. "What exactly did she say?"
"She threatened me, Philip! Said I needed to stay away from Brian,that I was a bad influence." Sarah's sob caught in her throat. "I'm in such a fragile state right now... what if this affects my relationship with the children?"

The word 'fragile' grated against my nerves. Before, Annie had managed our entire household while supporting my startup dreams, never once claiming fragility despite the genuine struggleswe faced.

"I'll talk to my mother," I replied mechanically, already drafting a mental script for that conversation.

"You don't understand how hard this is for me," Sarah pressed, her voice taking on that particular wheedling tone that had once seemed charming."With Robert's continued harassment, and now your mother..."

"I said I'll handle it." The words came out sharper than intended.

After ending the call, I sank into the leather couch by the window,letting my head fall back against the cool material. When had Sarah's voice become so... grating? The realization struck me: it wasn't her voice that had changed, but my perception of it.

Every conversation now followed the same pattern-Sarah encountering some crisis, requiring my intervention, leading to family tension that I needed to smooth over. The cycle was exhausting, yet somehow familiar.Then it hit me: this was exactly what Annie had accused me of during our divorce-creating constant drama that required her emotional labor to resolve.




I found myself absently straightening the family photo on my desk-the one from six years ago, with Annie and Brian at his kindergarten graduation. A habit I thought I'd broken. The sight of Annie's genuine smile in that photo twisted something in my chest. She'd never needed an audience for her devotion to our family, never turned every minor incident into a three-act drama requiring my intervention.

Even during our worst arguments, she'd maintained her dignity. She'd never weaponized tears or manipulation, never played the victim. The contrast with Sarah's behavior this morning was stark and uncomfortable.

The intercom buzzed, my secret's voice cutting through my reverie."Mr.Baker, your mother is on line one."

I reached for the phone, bracing myself. "Mother."

"Philip." Betty's voice carried that particular tone of disappointment she'd perfected over the years. "I assume Sarah's already given you her version of events?"

"She said you confronted her at her apartment-"

"Confronted?" Betty's laugh was sharp. "I simply expressed concern about Brian's recent behavior. That woman has him parroting the most awful things about Annie."

I shifted in my chair. "Sarah's going through a difficult time-"

"Oh, spare me." Betty's patience clearly had its limits. "Sarah's 'difficult time' seems to consist mainly of shopping sprees and manipulating my grandson. Meanwhile, Brian is the one truly suffering."

"Mother-"

"No, you listen to me, Philip. Brian is your *son*. Your actual, flesh-and-blood child." Betty's voice softened slightly. "You know, I never truly appreciated Annie until she was gone. She never complained, never tried to come between you and Brian. Do you remember how she used to make those special healthy snacks he loved, even when you were barely breaking even with the company?"

The memory hit hard-Annie in our tiny kitchen, carefully preparing Brian's allergy-safe treats while I worked late into the night. She'd never once mentioned how tight our budget was, never complained about the sacrifices she made.

"I'll talk to Sarah," I promised weakly.

"That's not enough anymore, Philip." Betty's sigh carried years of maternal concern. "You need to really think about what's best for Brian. And for yourself." The credit card statements landed on my desk with the weight of an accusation. Each page I turned revealed another of Sarah's extravagant purchases-designer bags,jewelry, furniture. The total made my throat tight:nearly two million dollars in three months. The same amount Annie had once suggested we invest in Brian's education fund.
My hands shook as I reviewed the charges. Designer boutiques,jewelry stores,high-end furniture-a steady stream of extravagant purchases that dwarfed our household expenses during my entire marriage to Annie.
Annie, who had furnished our first apartment with carefully chosen second-hand pieces. Who had insisted on saving for Brian's education before buying herself new clothes. Who hadsupported every one of my business ventures without ever demanding compensation for her sacrifices.
The contrast was nauseating. While Annie had helped build our life from nothing, Sarah was systematically draining resources without contributing anything of value. The realization hit me with the force of a physical blow:I had traded substance for shadow, reality for illusion.
My fingers were already dialing Annie's number before I fully processed the decision.
Twenty minutes later, I sat at an upscale café downtown. I'd chosen it for its exclusivity, the kind of place I thought would impress Annie. But watching her walk in-steps measured, head high, that familiar hint of jasmine in her wake-I realized how little I truly understood her. She'd never cared for pretense, had she?

I pushed a menu toward her. "They have excellent coffee-"

"I don't drink coffee anymore." Annie's voice was neutral. "The caffeine interferes with my creative work."

The simple statement hit like a sledgehammer. After six years of marriage, I couldn't even remember such a basic preference. Had I ever really known her at all?

"I made a mistake," I bluarted out. "Divorcing you. I see that now."

Annie's laugh held no humor. "Really? You're only realizing this after Sarah's shown her true colors?"

"It's not about Sarah-"

"No, it's about you." Annie's eyes met mine directly. "You're an abuser,Philip. A sophisticated one, but an abuser nonetheless. You didn't hit me or scream at me. You just slowly, systematically destroyed every part of me that didn't fit your ideal image."

"That's not-"

"You undermined my confidence, dismissed my art as a hobby, isolated me from friends who might have helped me see the truth." Annie's voice remained steady. "And now that your new relationship isn't providing the comfort and validation you crave, you think you can just come back?"

I stared at her, truly seeing her for perhaps the first time."Annie-"

"I have a good life now," she continued. "I have work that fulfills me,people who value me, and most importantly, I finally understand my own worth. I wouldn't trade that for anything, least of all your belated regrets."

"I have a good life now," she said firmly. "I agreed to meet today because I want to be clear: stop reaching out to me. I'm not interested in your regrets or explanations."

She stood, gathering her bag. "You know what's ironic? You're not actually missing me - you're missing having someone who would sacrifice everything to make your life easier. But I'm not that person anymore."I have a good life now," she said firmly. "I agreed to meet today because I want to be clear: stop reaching out to me. I'm not interested in your regrets or explanations."
She stood,reaching for her wallet. "You know what's ironic? You're not actually missing me - you're missing having someone who would sacrifice everything to make your life easier. But I'm not that person anymore."She placed several bills on the table, more than enough to cover both drinks."Consider this the last transaction between us."
I watched her walk away, somehing ugly and desperate clawing at my chest. The truth of her words burned like acid: I hadn't been thinking about Annie's happiness or growth, only about reclaiming what I'd carelessly thrown away.
The bills she'd left seemed to mock me - a final, stinging reminder that she no longer needed anything from me, not even the hollow gesture of paying for her coffee.
###Chapter 53: Slow Progress

Howard's POV

The private dining room's soft lighting couldn't mask Lucy and Penny's excitement as they entered. I straightened my already perfect cuffs,a habit from business meetings when I needed to maintain control. Seven place settings, one elegant cake, and a carefully curated menu-all arranged with the precision I applied to acquisition deals.

"Wow!" Both girls exclaimed simultaneously as they spotted the cake.

"You two should make a wish," I said, my voice softening in that particular way it did only around Lucy-and increasingly, around Annie.

The girls exchanged conspiratorial looks beforeleaning toward the candles.Lucy's expression shifted to one of intense concentration.

After extinguishing the candles, Penny threw her arms around Lucy. Their spontaneous celebration sent a strange pang through my chest-a recognition of childhood joy I'd never experienced myself.

"Time to eat, girls," Annie called, her tone warm yet authoritative. The dimple that appeared on her left cheek signaled genuine happiness.

Lucy settled beside Annie, her eyes repeatedly drifting toward the caramelized apple pie à la mode. I watched her internal debate play across her face before she turned toward me instead.

"I'd like some of the apple pie. Could you get some for me?" Her voice carried no trace of the hesitation that had marked her speech just weeks ago.

"Of course," I replied, feeling an unexpected surge of satisfaction as I served her. Only when she winked at Annie, silently mouthing "Mom,please eat!" did I understand-she'd deliberately avoided interrupting Annie's meal. Her thoughtfulness matched Annie's own-another quality they shared despite no biological connection.
I limited my contributions to the conversation, analyzing the group dynamics instead.
"Lucy," Edward addressed his granddaughter, "I understand you've been practicing a new exercise routine. How are you finding it?"
As Lucy enthusiastically described her progress, I noticed Eleanor's assessing glances between Annie and me, while Annie unconsciously mirrored Lucy's animated gestures. My fingers tapped a silent rhythm against my knee as I observed the group,feeling unexpectedly part of something that resembled a family.



Later, as we walked to our vehicles, I felt Edward's hand rest briefly on my shoulder-a gesture that would have triggered immediate discomfort from most people. Yet from him, I found myself accepting it without the usual tension.

"We'll see you back at the house," he said, his eyes conveying both trust and subtle assessment.

In the car, I caught Annie watching Sue's vehicle ahead of us,her expression contemplative.
"Does it bother you that I'm driving Sue home?" The question escaped before I could properly evaluate its strategic value.
Annie turned toward me, her brows drawing together in genuine confusion.
"Why would it bother me?"

Her response confirmed what I'd suspected but hoped wasn't true-no hint of possessiveness or interest beyond friendship. My fingers tightened imperceptibly on the steering wheel as I concealed my disappointment.

"You're right," I conceded simply, adjusting my expectations. Unlike business matters where progress could be accelerated through strategic pressure, emotions followed their own unpredictable timeline-a reality I found increasingly difficult to accept.
The silence that followed wasn't uncomfortable, though.

At Sue's apartment building, I scanned the surroundings with practiced efficiency, mentally noting security concerns that needed addressing.
"Thank you both for everything," Sue said, her professional demeanor softening slightly. "The dinner was lovely, and Lucy seems to be making remarkable progress."

"The progress is mutual," I replied, watching Penny help Lucy adjust her coat. "Lucy benefits greatly from your daughter's friendship."
After they entered the building, I conducted one final security assessment before returning to the car. Annie had settled deeper into her seat, her gaze fixed on the passing cityscape, lips slightly pursed in the expression she wore when mentally sketching new illustrations.



As we pulled through the estate gates, my phone vibrated with Catherine Morgan's name on the screen. The timing was unusual enough to warrant immediate attention.

"Would you mind keeping Lucy company while I take this?" I asked Annie. "It shouldn't take long."

Annie nodded, already shifting toward where Lucy waited in her nightgown, small fingers clutching her favorite book. "Take your time.We have storytime anyway." 
In my study, I accepted the call. "Catherine. This is unexpected."

"Howard!" Her voice carried its characteristic animation. "I hope I'm not interrupting anything important. I had the most fascinating conversation with Annie today at work and I thought you should know about it."
I moved to the window, positioning myself to observe the driveway while maintaining privacy. "Go on."
"We were discussing relationships-hypothetically,of course-and Annie said something quite revealing. When I asked what she would do if someone confessed feelings for her, she said she'd probably turn them down."
My jaw tightened, the muscles contracting in the same way they did during hostile takeover discussions. "Did she give a reason?"
"That's the interesting part," Catherine continued. "She said,'I just got divorced, my life is in pieces, and I'm trying to rebuild. I probably wouldn't deserve him right now."
So Annie's hesitation wasn't rejection based on lack of interest, but rather her assessment of timing and self-worth. This aligned with what I'd observed-her focus on establishing independence after her divorce.
"I see," I said finally. "Thank you for sharing this, Catherine."

"Aren't you going to ask about the 'him' she mentioned?" Catherine prompted.

"No," I replied simply. "If Annie wishes to discuss that with me directly,she will."

After ending the call, I remained at my desk, fingers steepled beneath my chin. The financial reports before me blurred as I considered what Catherine had shared. By eleven, I'd relocated to the living room,occupying the leather armchair where Annie typically joined me for evening conversation.I found myself checking my watch with unchaacteristic frequency, conscious of a growing restlessness I rarely experienced in business contexts.
Footsteps in the hallway prompted an immediate straightening of my posture, but instead of Annie, Edward Parker appeared carrying tea. The subtle disappointment I felt was instantly concealed.
"Chamomile," he explained, extending a cup. "Eleanor insists it helps with sleep,though I find the conversation that accompanies it more effective than the tea itself."

I accepted with a nod, recognizing the diplomatic approach. Edward's positioning-centered in his chair, hands relaxed but attentive-signaled preparation for significant conversation.

"She's helping Lucy fall asleep," Edward said, addressing my unspoken question. "They're reading that new book about the butterfly adventures.You have work tomorrow-perhaps you should rest early."
I remained silent, thinking about how much Lucy had improved since the Parkers' arrival. Her speech had become noticeably clearer, especially when interacting with multiple people. The benefits to her development made any small disruptions to our routines worthwhile.

Eleanor Parker appeared in the doorway.

"Annie promised Lucy the evening," Eleanor stated with precision. "She certainly won't sneak away after Lucy falls asleep to meet with you. Unless.


The calculated pause activated my full attention. "Unless?"' Eleanor's eyes held mine with the directness I'd seen in seasoned negotiators. "She's already fallen in love with you."
The blunt assessment hung between us like a proposed merger term.I didn't waste energy denying the implication about my own interests-inefficient when dealing with astute observers.
"That's not yet the case," I acknowledged, my tone matching the factual nature of quarterly earnings reports.
Edward nodded, his expression carrying the patience of someone who'd navigated complex family situations for decades. "There's an old saying:haste makes waste."

Eleanor settled beside her husband, her posture shifting slightly to signal a transition to more sensitive subject matter. "By the way..." she began, her tone recalibrating. "Annie has been married before. If you truly decide to be with her, you'll inevitably face strong opposition from certain people."
She leaned forward incrementally-just enough to signal importance without creating confrontation. "I must ask you... are you prepared to face all of that?"

I'd already thought through the potential complications. My mother would certainly disapprove and try to intervene again. The board might raise concerns about an employee relationship. The financial media would question Annie's motivations and my judgment.

None of these obstacles seemed insurmountable.

"Absolutely," I responded with the certainty I typically reserved for acquisition announcements.

"Then take it slowly," Edward advised, his tone warming. "Eventually,you'Il win Annie's heart." "I will." I promised.
###Chapter 54: Brian's Letter

Annie's POV

I found a letter from Brian in my mailbox. My heart instantly tightened at the sight of that familiar childish handwriting. I stood frozen in the hallway, memories flooding back to that day of betrayal-the "Perfect Family" group chat on the iPad, Brian declaring Sarah was his "real mom,"his small angry face as he screamed that I had ruined everything.

Part of me wanted to tear it open immediately. But another part-the part that had painstakingly rebuilt my life-hesitated. What could he possibly say that would heal those wounds? What apology could erase him telling me he hated me, that I wasn't fun like Sarah?

"Annie?" Lucy called from inside. "Are we going to school soon?"

Her voice anchored me to the present. This life with Lucy and Howard was my reality now, not the past that Brian's letter represented.With sudden resolve, I tossed the unopened letter into the corner of my bedroom. It belonged to the past, and I was building a future.

"Coming, sweetheart," I called back, composing myself.




In the car, Lucy sat on my lap, chattering about her plans with Penny "We're going to be butterfly explorers," she explained excitedly. "We'll make maps of the playground and find all the hiding spots." "Grandpa Edward will heIp us make explorer hats," she continued, "and Grandma Eleanor promised butterfly patches for our backpacks." The easy way she mentioned her grandparents warmed my heart.The Parkers had transformed Lucy from a selectively mute child to this expressive little girI who formed connections easily.

Lucy suddenly paused, her expression turning serious. "Of course, I love Mommy too."


The title no longer stung. Unlike Brian's conditional love, Lucy's affection was pure and freely given. I kissed her forehead gently.

"Mommy loves you too," I whispered. This unexpected bond had become precious beyond measure.

From the driver's seat, Howard turned with curious eyes. "What about Daddy? Don't you love Daddy too?"

"Love, love, love," Lucy replied with obvious reluctance. "Of course I love Daddy very much."


I suppressed a smile at Howard's satisfied expression. For someone with limited emotional experience, his love for Lucy was remarkably transparent.The intimidating CEO completely melted around this little girl.




At the preschool, Lucy scanned the entrance for Penny. When she spotted her friend, her face lit up completely. She leapt from my lap,running to embrace Penny with uninhibited joy.

As I turned to leave, a man and woman suddenly blocked my path.I stepped back instinctively, moving closer to Howard. "Who are you?" I askeddirectly. "We're Brian's tutor and driver," they answered, not bothering with names.Typical Philip,treating employees as faceless tools. Despite our fractured relationship, concern flickered through me. "How can I help you?" "This isn't a conversation for the sidewalk," the driver said tersely. "Let's find a café to talk."


I glanced at Howard, whose face remained impassive though I could read his silent support.

"Let's go," I decided, curious about their message and grateful for Howard's presence.




We sat at a nearby patisserie. They ordered cakes while I requested only tea, my appetite gone at the mention of Brian.

"Don't you think you're being cruel to Brian?" the driver asked bluntly.

His words pierced my heart. I stared into my teacup, struggling to maintain composure.

"He's only five, just a child who doesn't understand anything," he continued accusingly. "Every day at school when he sees you with Lucy,he cries silently. He loves you so much..."


Each word hammered at my guilt. Brian had once called me "the best mommy in the world." Where had that child gone? Transformed by Sarah's poisonous influence and Philip's indifference.

"How can you neglect him just because you divorced his father?" "Before you ask these questions," I replied quietly but firmly,"have you tried to understand what he did to me?" He shook his head. "What terrible thing could a child possibly do?" Memories flooded back-Brian pretending not to know me at school,calling Sarah "mommy" in that secret chat group, the stress causing my miscarriage. A five-year-old might not understand consequences, but the pain was real.

Looking at this stranger who could never comprehend my experience,I suddenly lost all desire to explain myself.

"Is that so?" I murmuared, more to myself than him.

When he tried to speak again, I reached for my bag, ready to leave. He immediately blocked my path and turned to Howard.

"If she's this heartless to her own biological son,how dare you employ her?"


Howard's voice turned icier than I'd ever heard it. "Because I personally witnessed how her husband, his mistress, and her son worked together to hurt her."


"So I never thought her actions were excessive," he continued with cold precision. "I only thought, if what happened to her had happened to me...my retaliation would have been far more merciless."

"She has been far too kind," he concluded.

Then Howard extended his hand to me-a rare public gesture of intimacy.When everyone else criticized my motherhood, only he fully understood and supported me. Warmth spread through my chest as I took his hand,drawing strength from his steadiness as he led me away. At Howard Technologies,Catherine Morgan was leaning against the wall,looking bored. Her expression brightened when she spotted us. "You're late," she complained, sounding like a stood-up date,"What happened?" "We ran into some trouble," I explained simply. Catherine immediately linked arms with me. "What's there to be sorry about?" Her rapid mood shifts always made me smile.

After checking that no one was watching, she pulled me into my office and shut the door. "I've successfully infiltrated the gaming department! I know all the company secrets!"

"You're something else, Catherine." I welcomed this distraction from the morning's heaviness.

She shared office gossip efficiently: a secret office romance, an upcoming project delay, embarrassing party incidents. Then she switched topics abruptly.

"Remember that guy who found a new girlfriend right after I rejected him?It's ridiculous! These rich kids have nothing better to do but flaunttheir relationship in front of me. They deliberately stand where I can see them being affectionate at gatherings. When I stopped attending events they'd be at, they spread rumors I was jealous!"

She took a deep breath. "So starting today, I'm focusing on work to prove my worth!"


"Then why are you chatting with Annie during work hours?" Howard's voice came unexpectedly from the doorway. "Is this your idea of working hard?"

 I turned to see him leaning against the doorframe, his eyes containing a hint of amusement despite his cool tone. Catherine straightened immediately. "Mr. Thompson! We were discussing the new children's book concept." "And how does office gossip factor into children's literature?" Howard raised an eyebrow. "Actually," I interjected, "we were discussing character dynamics. Office relationships make good models for children's stories... if you simplify the emotions."

Howard's eyes met mine with subtle acknowledgment. "Perhaps Ms.Morgan should observe more and talk less. Wouldn't you agree?"

After Catherine's hasty exit, Howard remained in the doorway."The concept looks promising," he said, nodding toward my sketches. "The board has high expectations."

He hesitated uncharacteristically. "About this morning..."

"Thank you," I said simply. "For understanding."

He nodded, accepting my desire to end the topic. "The publishing division needs your input on the cover design."

As he turned to leave, I found myself speaking again. "Howard?"

He paused.

"The way you described what happened... it helped. Sometimes I wonder if I'm remembering things correctly, if I'm the villain."
"You're not," he said with characteristic directness. "You're simply human-reacting to extraordinary pain reasonably."
 His words felt like permission to exist without constant self-doubt. As Howard left, I noticed my grip on the pencil had relaxed. Like my illustrations taking shape, I too was finding my form in this new life.The unopened letter in my bedroom would have to wait. Today belonged to the present, not the past.
###Chapter 55: New Target

Sarah's POV

I sprawled across the sofa, mindlessly clicking through television channels.Nothing held my interest for more than a few seconds. I sighed and tossed the remote aside, calculating how much the gesture of boredom resembled something from the soap operas I occasionally watched.

Life had become almost too comfortable since Philip had set me up in this Upper East Side apartment. His excuse for our "temporary separation" had been that Brian and I needed to "cool down," as if we had actual problems that required solving. The very thought made me smirk.

Not that I complained about the arrangement. Philip's absence meant freedom to enjoy the lifestyle I'd schemed for without his constant neediness. I mentally cataloged my victories: prime real estate, unlimited credit cards,and-perhaps most valuable-entry into New York's elite social circles where wealthier prospects awaited.

I checked my watch, calculating whether I had time for a facial before meeting anyone worth impressing tonight. My phone interrupted the thought-Philip's ringtone, that pretentious classical piece he'd programmed himself.

"Missing me already?" I purred, instantly switching to te honeyed voice that had always made him malleable.

"I'm sorry," Philip replied, his tone unexpectedly heavy. I sat up sharply, instinctively scanning for threats.Philip never apologized unless something threatened his comfort. Had he discovered one of my secret accounts? Was he cutting off my access to funds? "Did you cheat on me?" I asked tentatively, already calculating how I could leverage such an indiscretion. "No," Philip answered quickly. Then, to my shock, he continued, "But I've suddenly realized that the person I care about isn't you-it's Annie. I want to win her back and make things right with her."


My grip tightened on the phone as he continued, his voice growing almost cheerful. "The Upper East Side apartment you're living in now? It's yours to keep. I'll continue paying Max's child support on schedule too."

His tone became almost jubilant: "In the future, when we see each other,we can just pretend we don't know each other."

"Philip!" I exclaimed, genuinely alarmed. If I accepted this arrangement, I'd lose my personal ATM! There was absolutely no way I could let him go before securing my next financial provider.

"You can't possibly have feelings for Annie!" I stated calmly, shifting to a more reasonable tone. "Don't forget, you actively chose me over Annie. If you truly loved her, how could you have let her go so easily?"

When Philip didn't interrupt, I pressed my advantage. "This idea you've developed is nothing but an illusion created by our time apart. You're confused,that's all."


I made a mental note that living separately from Philip was clearly a mistake. It had taken him only a few days to "realize his true feelings."The thought of having to reprogram him yet again was exhausting.

"Sarah," Philip's voice cut through my planning, "have I ever told you that every minute I spend with you feels unbearable?" His words left me speechless. Before I could formulate a response, the call ended with a decisive clic, leaving me listening to the dial tone. By evening, I paced my kitchen, mentally reshuffling priorities while swirling winein a glass. The situation demanded immediate action. First:identify and secure a wealthier replacement for Philip. Second: manipulate Philip into continuing financial support until the transition was complete.I couldn't afford even a temporary interruption to my cash flow.

I drummed my fingers against the countertop, strategizing how to make Philip feel obligated to me again. The victim card always worked best with him. Robert's harassment offered the perfect opportunity-I'd weave a story of constant fear and maternal sacrifice that would trigger Philip's protective instincts.

Robert's recent unhinged behavior was irritating,yet perfectly timed. His appearance at Max's school yesterday-while genuinely annoying-provided exactly the kind of dramatic material I needed. Philip's guilt complex would make him feel responsible for our "safety." Men were so predictable in their need to play savior.

I pulled out my phone and scrolled through my contacts until I found Caroline's number. She'd been working at Howard Technologies for several months now-surely she'd have valuable intelligence about potential prospects there.

"Sarah!" Caroline answered on the second ring. "I was just about to call you.You won't believe what's happening at work."

"Tell me everything," I prompted, settling back against the cushions. "Annie's illustrations have gained a huge following, and she's made significant contributions to Howard Technologies' gaming division. I can't find any way to undermine her position. What are you planning to do?" I massaged my temples, feeling a headache forming. "I'll have to handle it myself. Philip's personality is actually quite predictable-even if he initiated this separation, I can easily drag things out if I choose to." I continued, thinking ahead: "By the way,since you work at Howard Technologies, you must encounter men with substantial status and wealth.If you notice anyone single, unmarried, and with assets exceeding Philip's,keep me informed. Send me their information and I'll screen for suitable candidates. Once I learn their preferences, I can pursue them directly."

I had no intention of pathetically clinging to Philip, begging him to love me again. Philip loved Annie... and the harder I tried to change that, the more he'd resent me. Eventually, he'd abandon me completely,leaving me financially strapped. Better to invest my energy in securing a new benefactor while I still had resources and position.

"What about Howard?" Caroline suggested after hearing my criteria.

"Howard?" I repeated, realizing I knew very little about the man beyond his reputation.

Caroline eagerly elaborated: "He likes Annie, which means he doesn't mind someone who's been married before. More importantly, his assets would take you a lifetime to spend. He's incredibly generous when it comes to Annie. He's built business initiatives around her talents and spares no expense promoting her work."

Her voice grew more animated as she continued, "Even if the relationship eventually ended, his company's annual profits alone would cover all your expenses."

The prospect was undeniably appealing. "I'll consider it," I replied thoughtfully. I hunched over my laptop after the call, methodically researching Howard Thompson like a hunter studying prey. The results made my pulse quicken.Caroline hadn't exaggerated-his business achievements were extraordinary,his personal reputation spotless. No scandals, no weaknesses exposed to public view. The articles documented Howard Technologies' exponential growth but revealed frustratingly little about the man himself.

I closed several tabs showing profit margins and market expansion,focusing instead on photos of Howard at events. The subtle indicators of wealth-the custom watches, the perfectly tailored suits that only the truly rich could afford-told me everything. This wasn't just money; this was*empire*.

A calculating smile spread across my face as I imagined the possibilities.Howard had feelings for Annie? Pathetic. I'd already proven my superiority by taking Philip from her-Howard would be no different. Men like him might build corporate empires, but ultimately they all responded to the same basic programming.

I began mentally cataloging approaches, discarding ineffective strategies.Philip had been susceptible to obvious sexuality and emotionalneediness.Howard would require subtler manipulation-intelligence,cultural refinement,strategic vulnerability. I'd need to project the perfect complementary presence to his power.

My fingers tapped rapidly, creating a document listing potential "accidental" meeting locations, conversation topics that would intrigue him,and ways to position myself as everything Annie wasn't. I'd need to study his schedule, preferences,weaknesses-information Caroline could provide. I closed my laptop with a decisive snap, feeling the familiar rush of plotting a complex acquisition. Howard Thompson represented everything I'd worked toward-permanent financial security that wouldn't evaporate with a man's changing moods. The challenge energized me in ways Philip never could. By morning, I'd have the foundation of my strategy mapped out.Philip's rejection would soon seem like the luckiest break of my life. Annie Baker would once again watch helplessly as I claimed my prize. And Howard-brilliant,wealthy Howard-would never recognize the trap until he was thoroughly ensnared.
###Chapter 56: Respect

Howard's POV

I tapped lightly on Annie's office door. She was absorbed in her work,stylus moving across the tablet screen.

"Annie," I said, using the gentler tone reserved only for her and Lucy. "It's time for lunch."

"Is it that time already?" She checked the clock,quickly saved her work and stood. "Let's go. I am hungry, actually."

As we exited the building, I immediately detected something amiss. Philip Baker stood at the entrance with an elaborate display: a heart-shaped frame filled with their old marriage photos, surrounded by lilac roses. A banner beside it read "Please Forgive Me, For Our Memories."

I maintained my neutral expression despite my displeasure. My immediate concern was Annie. I quickly assessed her reaction: slightly accelerated breathing and tension in her shoulders, though her expression remained composed.

Philip wore an expensive suit, clearly having come from his Wall Street office. Upon seeing Annie, he strode forward confidently.
"Annie, I decided to express my feelings in a more meaningful way.These are our most precious memories..." Annie remained still as she looked over the photographs. Her expression showed none of the emotional turmoil I had anticipated-her eyes held a detached quality instead. "Philip," she began, her voice remarkably steady,"these photos certainly document our past. But that's all they represent now-the past." Philip cut in eagerly: "But those memories still exist, Annie. Our six years of marriage, our son Brian-all of it proves that what we had was real."

Annie shook her head slightly. "The Annie from before might have been moved by this gesture, but people change,Philip. The woman who would have been touched by romantic gestures like this doesn't exist anymore."

This statement captured my full attention. Annie's perspective on conventional romantic demonstrations had evidently shifted-information that would necessarily impact my pursuit strategy. I'd been formulating next steps in our relationship, but this new data point suggested a recalibration might be required.

"Annie, please give me another chance..." Philip's voice interrupted my analysis.

"We're finished," Annie stated with finality. "The best thing is for both of us to move forward. If you truly respect me, you'll stop these gestures."

Philip's expression registered injury. "Do you really feel nothing at all for our past?"
Annie drew a measured breath. "I value the good memories, but that doesn't mean I want to return to the past."
I stepped forward to stand beside her. "How would you like to handle this situation?" I asked quietly, ensuring my tone con veyed that I would respect whatever decision she made. Annie glanced at me gratefully. "These things should be removed, but I'd prefer to avoid creating a scene." I nodded once, extracting my phone to send a brief message to my head of security.Within fifty-eight seconds, my security team materialized with professional efficiency. "Mr. Baker," I addressed him with deliberate neutrality, "please allow our staff to assist you with these items. This is company property, and such displays require prior authorization."

Philip appeared ready to protest but, after evaluating my expression,chose compliance instead. The security teamn began systematically dismantling the display, removing the frame and banner with practiced efficiency.

"This changes nothing," Philip said to Annie as a parting statement. "I'Il prove to you that I'm sincere."




Night had fallen. Annie sat in her customary position on the terrace,holding a cup of chamomile tea. I'd chosen water-caffeine would disrupt my sleep.

My thoughts remained fixed on the afternoon's incident. Annie's response to Philip's romantic gesture necessitated reconsideration of my approach.

"Regarding Philip's display today," I began,selecting my phrasing with precision, "I'm curious about your perspective on that type of... public declaration."

Annie sipped her tea thoughtfully before responding. "The person I used to be might have found it moving. But now, this kind of gesture seems performative-designed to satisfy his need for validation rather than considering what I actually want." "So you dislike romantic gestures?" I probed further. A slight smile curved her lips. "I don't dislike romance. I've just come to appreciate romance based on understanding and respect, rather than orchestrated scenarios." Her answer provided critical insight. Annie hadn't rejected romance entirely but had redefined what constituted meaningful romantic expression. I mentally recorded this distinction for future reference.

My peripheral vision caught movement in the parking area. A familiar vehicle had stopped there, lights off but with someone still inside. I confirmed my suspicion-Philip Baker.

Anger flared in my chest before I suppressed it. Philip had tacked Annie to my private residence? This behavior crossed all acceptable boundaries.My initial impulse was to move closer to Annie, perhaps take her hand to demonstrate intimacy.

I immediately rejected this impulse. Such an action would reduce Annie to a possession, no different from Philip's approach. Annie wasn't a prize but a person deserving respect. Initiating contact without consent would violate my principles.

Instead, I extracted my phone and rapidly composed a message to Philip:"Jealous? I'm the one sitting with her watching the moonlight now."
After sending it, I returned to my seat, experiencing a small but distinct satisfaction.

"What is it?" Annie asked, noticing my attention shift. "What are you looking at?"
"Nothing important," I replied evenly. "Thought I saw wildlife movement.Likely a false alarm." My phone screen illuminated with Philip's response: "Annie and I shared six years and have a child together. That's a connection you can never replace." I permitted myself a slight smirk, responding: "Mr. Baker, that belongs to the past. I represent her present and future." "Really?" Annie asked, clearly noting the subtle changes in my expression.

I pocketed my phone, offering a measured smile. "Indeed. It's getting late.
We should retire. You have an editorial meeting tomorrow morning."

Annie nodded, rising from her chair. "You're right. Goodnight,Howard."

"Goodnight, Annie." I watched her departure from the terrace.

Once certain Annie had moved beyond hearing range, I returned to the terrace edge, observing as Philip's headlights finally activated and his vehicle departed. I extracted my phone once more,sending a final message:"If I chose to, I could ensure you never approach her again. Mr. Baker."
Ten minutes later, seated in my study's leather chair, I organized materials for tomorrow's executive meeting when my phone vibrated with Philip's reply:
"Sarah's been injured. I need to check on her. If Annie knew how much I care about others, she'd understand what a loving person I am!"
I emitted a cold laugh, instantly comprehending the situation. Philip proclaimed love for Annie while immediately abandoning his pursuit at Sarah's call. This behavioral pattern had likely existed throughout their marriage, explaining Annie's absolute certainty in terminating that relationship.

I responded: "Did you ever show such concern when Annie was hurt? No.Your differential treatment reveals everything-your affection lies with Sarah,not Annie: I suggest you return to Sarah and abandon this self-deception."

Setting down my phone, I contemplated the insight Philip's behavior provided. If I truly intended to win Annie's heart, I needed to avoid Philip's fundamental error-I must genuinely respect her, understand her needs ratherthan imposing my expectations upon her.
###Chapter 57: Assistance

Howard's POV

I sat alone in Howard Technologies' executive conference room, fingers drumming a precise rhythm against the mahogany table.

I extracted my phone,scrolled to Catherine Morgan's contact, and placed the call. The line connected after two rings.

"Could you come by?" I asked without preamble. "I need to discuss something with you."

"Work-related?" Catherine's voice immediately tensed, the casual lilt she typically employed with colleagues vanishing instantly.

"More or less." I offered no elaboration, seeing no strategic value in prolonging her anxiety unnecessarily.

After a telling silence, Catherine managed a reluctant "Okay." The walk from her department to the executive floor typically required no more than three minutes, yet nearly ten passed before she appeared at the conference room doorway.She hesitated visibly before entering, offering an awkward smile that poorly masked her apprehension.

"Mr. Thompson..." Catherine began, her posture suggesting she was bracing for disciplinary action. "I know I've been chatting too much in the office lately, but I promise I've completed all my assignments,and-"
"I'm not firing you, Catherine." I interrupted her nervous justification,finding it both inefficient and unnecessary.
"Really?" She dramatically clutched her chest, exhaling with exaggerated relief. "That's good. I was thinking it would be pretty tragic to get fired just for discussing which designer bag looks better with mynew shoes." I maintained my neutral expression, bypassing her attempt at levity."I have a question for you. What type of men do women generally find appealing?"

Catherine blinked rapidly, clearly recalibrating her expectations for this meeting. "Wait, how is this related to work?"

"It isn't," I acknowledged simply.

The admission transformed Catherine's demeanor instantly.She leaned forward,eyes widening with sudden interest. "Oh! This is about Annie, isn t it? I already helped you discover why she's refusing relationships! Now you want to know how to pursue her?"

I nodded. My silence served as tacit acknowledgment.

"Consider Philip," I said, my analytical approach activating automatically."
For all his flaws, he successfully married Annie. Comparatively, my experience in this domain is inadequate."
Catherine failed to suppress her amusement, a brief laugh escaping her. "Howard Thompson has something he's not good at? That's breaking news!"
I regarded her momentary lapse in professional decorum without comment,opting instead for candor. "Since Lucy's arrival, I haven't had female companionship. I may be... somewhat out of practice."
"You must have dated before, right?" Catherine probed, curiosity evident in her expression.
After brief consideration, I acknowledged: "Indeed. However, those were transient relationships. My feelings for Annie are different."
"Hasn't your mother arranged introductions?" Catherine continued,evidently finding my romantic inexperience fascinating. "Many," I confirmed, "but throughout my life, I've maintained an instinctive resistance to my strict mother's influence. Her recommended candidates invariably failed to capture my interest."

Catherine nodded thoughtfully, then her expression shifted subtly. A calculating look flickered across her features as though she'd formulated a theory she wasn't immediately prepared to share. Instead,she offered a sly smile that triggered my strategic alertness.

"Before I share my brilliant idea," Catherine suddenly stated, "could you do me a favor?"


I raised an eyebrow, mentally assessing potential implications. "What kind of favor?"


"Say yes first," Catherine countered with unexpected shrewdness. "It's a fair exchange. I help solve your Annie situation, you help solve my situation."

I hesitated briefly,calculating risk factors against potential benefits. While my natural inclination resisted committing to undefined terms,I recognized that my pursuit of Annie might benefit from alternative perspectives. "Acceptable, provided the request remains reasonable."

"Excellent!" Catherine's hands came together in a quick clap of satisfaction."So my plan is..."
She leaned toward me, lowering her voice conspiratorially as she outlined her proposal directly into my ear. I listened with growing skepticism,raising an eyebrow when she finished.
"You believe this approach will be effective?" I questioned,analyzing the probability of success.
"Trust me," Catherine responded with unwarranted confidence."This plan is foolproof." She paused deliberately before adding, "As for that favor... wait for my call."




The afternoon sun had begun its descent when my phone displayed "Margaret Thompson" on the screen. I raised an eyebrow fractionally-my mother's timing was predictable. Following our contentious exchange regarding Annie two weeks prior, I had strategically reduced her usual financial allowance. The calculated pressure appeared to have produced its intended effect.

"What is it?" I answered dispassionately, maintaining neutral intonation.

The line remained silent for several seconds. I could detect my mother's measured breathing, suggesting internal conflict.

"I'm busy," I reminded her, my tone deliberately cooler than usual."If there's nothing urgent-"
"I've been thinking lately..." Margaret finally spoke, her characteristic assertiveness noticeably diminished. "Howard, we can't continue like this."
Her voice carried an unfamiliar vulnerability. "You know, since you reduced my living expenses, everything has becomne quite difficult."
"You brought this upon yourself.," I responded without emotional inflection.
"You attempted to interfere with my personal affairs. These are the consequences."

"I visited Sophia, your sister," she mentioned my sister, "hoping she might help..."
The situation immediately crystallized in my mind. While my sister's company performed adequately, its scale was incomparable to Howard Technologies. If my mother's historically lavish lifestyle required merely a fraction of my company's profits, it would represent a substantial burden on Sophia's more modest enterprise.

"What was her response?" I inquired, though I had already calculated the most probable answer.


Margaret released an audible sigh. "She said her company simply couldn't sustain my expenses unless..."

"Unless she liquidated the business," I completed her statement. "Clearly an imprudent option."

"I've realized something these past few days," she continued, her tone softening perceptibly. "Howard, you're an adult with your own perspective.As your mother, I shouldn't interfere excessively."

This uncharacteristic concession immediately suggested external influence."Sophia convinced you of this, didn't she?"

"How did you know?" Margaret's surprise carried through the connection.

I observed objectively. "Within our family, she appears to be the only individual capable of persuading you."

A slightly embarrassed laugh emanated from the receiver,but my mother offered no contradiction to my assessment.
"If you seek my forgiveness, the requirements are straightforward," I stated without prevarication. "Apologize to Lucy in my presence.Should she forgive you, I'll discontinue harboring resentment, and naturally,your monthly financial support will resume."
"Impossible!" Margaret refused instantly, her voice regaining its familiar rigidity.
In the background, I distinctly heard my sister's casual yet deliberately audible remark: "Mom, I might actually need to consider selling the company then..."

The statement evidently affected my mother's resolve. She deflated immediately, communicating with clear frustration: "Fine, I agree."

"Excellent," I responded, my tone remaining level despite the internal satisfaction I experienced. This minor family power negotiation had concluded with a victory for the alliance between my sister and myself.




Early evening found me driving toward Lucy's school, with Annie occupying the passenger seat. Her phone suddenly emitted its distinctive chime.


"It's Catherine," Annie observed, glancing at the display before accepting the call.

"Hello, Catherine," Annie greeted.

I observed her expression transform from neutral to confused before she extended the device toward me. "She wants to speak with you."

"What is it?" I accepted the phone, maintaining my customary composure.

"Howard, remember that favor you owe me?" Catherine's voice conveyed both urgency and anxiety. "I need you to fulfill that promise now. Several projects at my father's company have encountered critical issues, and I'm uncertain how to inform him. Could you meet with us in an advisory capacity?"

I glanced briefly at Annie, noting her curious observation.

"What time?" I inquired concisely.

"Seven o'clock," Catherine replied. "Thank you, Howard. I realize this is unexpected, but it's genuinely important." "I'll be there," I confirmed, my tone remaining measured.

After terminating the call, Annie immediately questioned: "What's happening? Catherine sounded distressed."

"Some commercial matters involving the Morgan family," I explained with deliberate neutrality. "She's requested my consultation."

"Is this what she discussed with you in your office this morning?" Annie deduced perceptively.

I turned toward her, permitting a marginal expression of surprise."How did you know about that?"

Annie's lips curved upward. "There are no secrets in an office environment,Howard. Particularly when Catherine Morgan is involved."

"Indeed," I acknowledged, allowing a slight elevation at the corner of my mouth. "However, in this instance, her request for assistance issincere."

"Then tonight, Lucy and I can-"

"You should both accompany me," I interjected. "The meeting won't extend excessively. Additionally, Lucy appreciates the dessert selection at that establishment."
###Chapter 58: Invitation

Annie's POV

As we entered the private dining room of one of Manhattan's prestigious hotels, Lucy's small hand tightened in mine, her shyness returning in this unfamiliar environment. I gave her fingers a reassuring squeeze,understanding her discomfort. These high-end settings still made me feel out of place sometimes-like I was playing dress-up in someone else's life.

Mr. Morgan rose to greet us, his warm smile directed particularly at Howard. His eyes flickered between Howard and Catherine with unmistakable expectation, and I felt awkward as I recognized his misinterpretation of our gathering. *Great, another person who thinks Howard and Catherine would make a perfect match*, I thought,then immediately questioned why that bothered me.

"Howard! It's wonderful to finally meet you in person," Mr. Morgan extended his hand with unmistakable enthusiasm, his eyes flickering between Howard and Catherine with thinly veiled expectation. "Catherine has spoken so highly of you."

"Dad!" Catherine interjected, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment.Her eyes telegraphed a silent plea as she continued, "Mr. Thompson rarely accepts meeting requests from anyone."

Howard remained unruffled and began the introductions. "This is my daughter," he stated,gesturing toward Lucy.
*His daughter*. The words sent an unexpected warmth through me.Though Lucy wasn't biologically his, Howard had stepped into the role of father with such natural grace that sometimes I forgot their relationship hadn't always existed.
"Hello!" Mr. Morgan responded enthusiastically, bending slightly to meet Lucy at eye level.

Lucy offered only the slightest nod in acknowledgment,retreating partially behind me. I placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder, feeling the tension in her small frame.

"And this is Lucy's mother," Howard continued,his hand making a subtle gesture in my direction.

*Lucy's mother*. Not Annie Baker, not the illustrator from his company.The introduction simultaneously warmed me.

Mr. Morgan's confusion was evident as his eyes darted between Howard and me, trying to determnine our relationship.

Catherine caught her father's questioning glance and mouthed silently,"T'll explain later!"

Once we were seated, Mr. Morgan transitioned to business matters,outlining the challenges facing his family enterprises.

Howard listened attentively, asking pointed questions that cut to the heart of each issue. His analysis was methodical and precise. I found myself admiring the way his mind worked-how he could distill complex problems into solvable components. It was the same precision he brought to everything, whether business deals or ensuring Lucy had her favorite breakfast.
"Can they be saved?" Mr. Morgan finally asked. "Yes," Howard responded with quiet confidence before outlining his solution. Mr. Morgan's expression transformed from worry to admiration as Howard spoke. I realized that Howard's appeal extended beyond his appearance or wealth. It made me feel simultaneously safe in his presence and acutely aware of how different our worlds were.

Despite Catherine's earlier warnings and obvious discomfort, Mr.Morgan eventually steered the conversation in the direction she had clearly been dreading.

"So,Howard," he began with barely disguised intention, "what do you think of my daughter? She graduated top of her class at Harvard Business School,you know."

"Dad!" Catherine interjected desperately before Howard could respond. "In Mr. Thompson's eyes, I'm definitely a qualified employee!" Her voice carried forced brightness as she attempted damage control. "I'm still learning so much from him."

I found myself holding my breath, irrationally interested in Howard's response. The thought made me uncomfortable in ways I wasn't prepared to examine.
Raising her glass of fruit juice in Howard's direction, she added hastily,"Mr. Thompson, rest assured that I'll work hard at the company in the future!"

Howard acknowledged her statement with a slight nod. "Good,"he replied simply.
I felt a ridiculous surge of relief. Catherine's practiced smile didn't falter.Catherine had moved on, I realized. The way she spoke about working hard at the company sounded genuine.


Back at the Long Island estate, Thomas, Lucy's exercise coach, was waiting."We're going to increase intensity today," he announced.
Lucy adapted readily to the more challenging routine. I attempted to match her energy despite the fatigue I'd been feeling.

As we reached the running portion, dizziness washed over me. Cold sweat beaded on my forehead as I fought to maintain composure. The monthly cramps intensified.

Howard caught the momentary falter in my stride and signaled Thomas to pause.

"I think that's enough for today," Howard stated firmly.

After arranging for Thomas to be driven home, Howard approached me with concern.

"Annie, are you feeling unwell?" he asked quietly. "You've been pale since the middle of the run."
I considered deflecting, pretending everything was fine-a habit developed during years with Philip, who'd had little patience for "female problems."But there was something in HowardI's expression that made prevarication seem unnecessary.
"It's...um...that time of the month," I explained awkwardly, unused to discussing such personal matters with him. "Makes me more fatigued than usual."
I braced myself for discomfort or dismissal, but Howard's expression remained attentive and concerned. No judgment, no disgust.
Lucy, who had been gathering her water bottle and towel, approached us with concern evident in her expressive eyes. "Should you rest?"
Lucy suddenly turned to Howard, her expressionearnest."Dad,I read that a heating pad and chamomile tea help with cramps. Could we get some for Mom?" Howard nodded immediately. "Of course. I'Il arrange it right away."

I watched him stride away, efficient and purposeful even in this unexpected scenario. How many CEOs would personally arrange for tea and a heating pad? The thought made me smile despite my discomfort.

While Howard stepped away to make arrangements, Lucy disappeared briefly before returning with a children's book. She settled quietly beside me on the sofa, opening the book without commentary but clearly intending to provide company.
Howard returned several minutes later carrying a steaming cup of tea and what appeared to be a high-end heating pad.

"The housekeeper said this blend might help," Howard explained, carefully placing the tea on the side table within my reach.

Lucy approached with the heating pad, handling it with deliberate care."I heard this helps with the pain," she offered softly.
"Thank you both. This is very thoughtful," I said sincerely,genuinely moved by their considerate gestures. Philip had never once, in six years of marriage, acknowledged my discomfort during these times. Yet Howard and Lucy, who had known me for mere months, showed such natural consideration. Later that evening, after Edward and Eleanor had tactfully suggested taking Lucy for a walk through the gardens-providing me space to rest-Howard remained in the living room,reviewing several documents. I noticed Howard's gaze occasionally drifting toward me, carrying an uncharacteristic hesitancy. The uncertainty in his expresson made me curious. "You probably need to work. I should head upstairs," I suggested,preparing to give him privacy.

"I have time now," Howard replied, setting his tablet aside. "Annie, would you like to talk for a while?"

"Sure," I agreed, resettling on the sofa.

An unusual silence fell between us-not our typical comfortable quiet, but something charged with unspoken thoughts. Howard seemed to be weighing his words carefully.

"Is there something you want to tell me?" I finally asked, breaking the unusual silence.

After a moment's consideration, Howard met my gaze directly. "I need to attend a charity gala."
The statement seemed anticlimactic after such buildup, and I waited for him to continue, sensing there was more.
"As you might have noticed, I don't have many female acquaintances,"Howard continued with careful precision. "Wouald you accompany me?" The invitation caught me off guard. A charity gala meant New York's elite-wealthy investors, society figures, possibly even Philip's social circle.The thought made my stomach tighten with anxiety. I wasn't ready for that level of scrutiny, for the whispers that would inevitably follow the divorced illustrator accompanying Howard Thompson. And yet...something in Howard's expression made refusal difficult. *What exactly would this mean?* I wondered. Was this just a business arrangement? "Alright," I nodded, accepting the invitation despite my reservations.Howard had done so much for Lucy and me-how could I refuse this simple request?

"Tll have Susan select appropriate attire and have it delivered to the ofice for you to try," Howard added, already shifting into hisefficient planning mode.


The practical consideration was both reassuring and slightly intimidating.Of course I would need special clothes-my modest wardrobe hardly contained anything suitable for the kind of event Howard would attend.

"And arrange for a stylist if you'd like," he continued thoughtfully.

"Is this gala very important?" I asked, curiosity winning over hesitation.

"Yes," Howard acknowledged carefully. "Many business partners will be there."
"But don't worry," HHoward assured me, correctly reading my concerns."I'lI be right beside you."
"Just stay by my side," he added with quiet certainty. "You don't need to do anything else."
###Chapter 59: Unexpected Apologies

Annie's POV

I stepped out of my bedroom, my body still aching slightly though the worst of yesterday's discomfort had subsided. Lucy was tiptoeing down the stairs with exaggerated caution.

When she spotted me, her face immediately transformed into an expression of concern that seemed almost comically adult.

"Mom, shouldn't you be resting?" she asked, her brow furrowed with worry. "Yesterday you didn't feel well."

"I'm feeling much better today, sweetheart," I assured her, descending the remaining steps. "Well enough for my work."
Lucy remained unconvinced, studying my face with surprising intensity."But if you start to feel bad again, you have to stop. Promise?" She extended her pinky finger solemnly.
I linked my pinky with hers, suppressing a smile at her seriousness. "Promise."

In the car, Lucy settled between us, content to remain close rather than pressing her face against the window as she usually did.
"Excited about your butterfly explorer project?" I asked.

She nodded enthusiastically, "Penny and I are going to make the best map ever. We'll find all the secret places where butterfles hide."
"That sounds wonderful," I encouraged. "Will you show me when it's finished?"
"Of course!" Lucy replied as if the question were absurd. "I show you everything important." *Everything important*. The simple phrase carried such weight. I remembered when I'd first come to live with them-silent,withdrawn,communicating only through nods and shakes of her head, if at all. Now she spoke freely, sharing her thoughts and feelings with increasing confidence.

As we approached the school, Lucy finally spotted Penny waiting by the entrance. Her entire face lit up, but instead of immediately clamoring to exit the vehicle as she usually did, she turned to me frst.

"Will you be here when school finishes?" she asked, her voice carrying a hint of vulnerability.

"Of course," I promised, gently tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "T Il be waiting right here."

Only then did she nod, apparently satisfied,and prepare to leave. She hugged me quickly, then turned to Howard. "Bye, Dad!"

My smile faltered when I spotted Margaret Thompson waiting near the entrance. What was she doing here?

"Mother," Howard greeted her.

"I came to speak with Lucy," she stated,her gaze sliding toward the child who now half-hid behind my legs, regarding Margaret with undisguised wariness."And what would you like to say to her?" Howard inquired, his voice carrying a protective edge. Margaret drew a measured breath, looking distinctly uncomfortable. "I wish to apologize for my previous behavior." The statement hung in the air, as surprising as if she'd announced she was joining the circus. Lucy peeked out from behind me, her expression cautious but curious.

Margaret knelt down, a movement that seemed to cost her considerable pride, bringing herself to eye level with Lucy. "I wasn't very nice to you before," she began stiffly. "The things I said about your condition were unkind and incorrect. I'm... sorry."

Lucy studied Margaret's face. After a long moment, she nodded once."Okay."

The simple acceptance seemed to both relieve and perplex Margaret. Then,she rose to her feet, smoothing her skirt with practiced precision.

"Is that all?" Howard asked, his tone suggesting he found the apology insufficient.

Margaret's lips thinned slightly. "What more would you have me say?"

"Perhaps you should also apologize to Annie," Howard suggested,though his tone made it clear this wasn't merely a suggestion.

Margaret turned toward me, looking as if she'd swallowed something unpleasant. "Ms. Baker, I may have... misjudged you initially. My comments regarding your background andI suitability for employment were...premature." Standing there, I found myself considering everything that had happened wíth Philip-his betrayal, Sarah's manipulation, Brian's rejection.Compared to those wounds, Margaret's disapproval seemed almost trivial. "I accept your apology," I said simply. Margaret blinked, clearly surprised by my ready acceptance. "Just like that?" "Life's too short to hold grudges over misunderstandings," I replied with a slight shrug.

Margaret's gaze flicked between me and her granddaughter. "Thank you."

"Good," Howard interjected coolly. "Now, if you'll excuse us, we have work to attend to."




Later, in my office, I reviewed the final animations for my illustrated children's story. My characters now moved across the screen, their adventures unfolding just as I'd imagined.

"The board is impressed," Howard commented. "Your concept has exceeded initial projections."

I smiled,still somewhat amazed that my simple drawings had evolved into this. "I never imagined my illustrations would become animations."

"This is merely the beginning," Howard replied with characteristic certainty."The gaming division has expressed interest in developing interactive educational content based on your character designs."

His casual confidence in my success both exhilarated and intimidated me.In just months, I'd transformed from a divorced,unemployed mother with fractured confidence intoa respected creative professional.

"Do you think-" I began, but a sharp knock interrupted my question. Before either of us could respond, the door swung open to reveal Sarah Johnson. She wore a designer outfit that somehow managed to be both professional and provocative-a skill she'd always possessed. "I hope I'm not interrupting," she said with practiced contrition, though her calculating gaze swept the office. Howard's expression immediately hardened. "How did you gain access to this floor?"

Sarah ignored his question. "Annie, I needed to see you."

"What do you want, Sarah?" I asked,proud of how steady my voice remained.


"I came to apologize," she declared, her voice thick with what anyone who didn't know her might mistake for genuine emotion. "I was young and foolish, and I never considered how my actions would hurt you."

The absurdity of her statement almost made me laugh. "Young? Sarah, you're thirty-three. You knew exactly what you were doing."

"I made a terrible mistake," she insisted. "Can't you find it in your heart to forgive me?"

I studied her face-the calculated vulnerability, the coldly assessing eyes."Some things can't be fixed with a simple 'I'm sorry,' Sarah. You didn't just have an affair with my husband. You deliberately poisoned my son against me."


"What can I do to make amends?" she asked, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Please, tell me what you want."

"I want you and Philip to stay out of my life," I sated clearly. "That's all." As I spoke, I noticed Sarah's gaze shifting occasionally toward Howard,who remained silent but watchful beside my desk. A suspicion began forming in my mind about her true purpose here. "You're still in love with Philip, aren't you?" Sarah suddenly asked,her tone sharpening. "That's why you can't forgive me-because you're still holding onto him." The accusation was so absurd that I simply stared at herfor a moment before responding. "Really? That after everything he did. I'm pining for him?"


"It's understandable," Sarah continued, her voice taking on a sympathetic tone that made my skin crawl. "He was your first love, the father of your child. Of course you'd have trouble letting go."

"What I find interesting," I replied calmly, "is how predictable you are,Sarah. You always use the same tactics-gaslighting, false sympathy,playing the victim. Don't you ever get tired of being so... repetitive?"

Sarah's composure slipped momentarily before she launched into her next performance-collapsing into the visitor's chair with a dramatic sob."I'm just trying to make things right! Why are you being so cruel?"

"Cruel?" I repeated, feeling an odd detachment as I watched her theatrics."Sarah, if I were truly cruel, I would have already shared with all our mutual acquaintances exactly what you did-how you coached my five-year-old son to reject me, how you created a secret chat group called'Perfect Family' while I was still married to Philip, how you deliberately caused me stress that contributed to my miscarriage."

Sarah's sobbing abruptly ceased, her eyes widening slightly at the mention of details I'd never publicly disclosed. "But I haven't done that," I continued evenly. "Not because I care about your reputation, but because it would hurt Brian to have everyone know how he was manipulated. So no, Sarah, I'm not being cruel. I'm being remarkably restrained." Sarah's expression hardened. "You've changed. You used to be so... soft." "Yes," I agreed simply. "I have." The office phone suddenly rang. Howard, who had remained a silent observer throughout our exchange, answered it, his voice carrying its usual measured authority. "Thompson speaking."

After listening briefly, he addressed the person on the other end with quiet intensity. "I want to know how an unauthorized individual gained access to the executive floor. Implement security protocol seven immediately.Effective immediately, only employees and confirmed business partners are permitted entry."


Sarah's expression shifted as she realized the implications. "You can't throw me out!" she protested, her voice rising indignantly. "I came here in good faith!"


Howard regarded her with the same detached assessment I'd seen him direct at business competitors. "You may leave voluntarily, or security will escort you out. The choice is yours."

Sarah gathered her purse, movements sharp with anger. "This isn't over,"she declared, though the threat sounded hollow.
###Chapter 60: Charity Gala

Howard's POV

I maintained my customary brisk pace through the Howard Technologies corridors, the small team of stylists following several steps behind.Susan had assembled them with remarkable efficiency.

Approaching Annie's office, I observed through the glass partition that she appeared to be preparing to leave her desk. Perhaps for her customary afternoon break-a habit I'd noted but never commented on, recognizing its value in her creative process. My watch indicated 2:17 PM. Perfect timing.


I entered without knocking, the styling team following behind me in a practiced formation. Annie looked up, her expression shifting from concentration to confusion as she registered the unexpected entourage.

The lead stylist-Vanessa, if I recalled correctly-stepped forward,her gaze shifting between Annie and myself with professional assessment.

"Mr. Thompson," she inquired with practiced deference, "is she the one we'Il be styling today?"

I nodded once. "Yes."

Annie's brow furrowed slightly-the particular expression she displayed when encountering unexpected variables. "What are they doing here?"
I explained matter-of-factly. "They're here to prepare you for tonight's charity gala."

Understanding dawned in her eyes,followed immediately by what appeared to be mild alarm. Before she could formulate an objection, the youngest stylist-an efficient brunette whose name escaped me-approached Annie with practiced confidence. "Please close your eyes," she instructed gently, already reaching for her cosmetics case.

Annie hesitated briefly before complying, her shoulders tensing slightly as the styling team converged around her. I observed the process from a strategic position near the door, noting Annie's discomfort with the attention. Despite her obvious unease, she remained still, permitting the professionals to work without interruption.


The makeup artist applied foundation with precise movements while another began arranging Annie's hair.

Annie maintained her composed exterior, but subtle indicators-the slight tension in her jaw, the controlled rhythm of her breathing-suggested internal resistance to the process. I found myself wondering about her thoughts. Based on previous patterns, she was likely calculating the productivity cost of this interruption to her work schedule, perhaps mentally rearranging her upcoming deadlines.




"You can open your eyes now," the makeup artist announced, stepping back to assess her work.
Another team member approached with a garment bag, unzipping it to reveal an elegant evening gown in deep navy blue. The stylist held it forward expectantly. "The restroom is just there if you'd like to change." Annie blinked several times, as though emerging from deep concentration.She accepted the dress with a slight nod before disappearing into the adjacent restroom. The styling team exchanged satisfied glances, making minor adjustments to their equipment while waiting. I maintained my position by the window,reviewing acquisition projections on my tablet while monitoring the situation peripherally.

When the bathroom door reopened, I instinctively glanced up, then found myself unable to return to the financial data before me.

The transformation was...remarkable.

Annie emerged in the navy blue gown, its design simultaneously sophisticated and understated. The styling team had selected perfectly-the dress complemented rather than overwhelmed her natural presence.Her hair, usually secured in a practical arrangement for work, now fell in soft waves that framed her face. The makeup enhanced rather than masked her features, drawing particular attention to her eyes.

I discovered myself unable to redirect my attention with my usual efficiency. Something about the contrast between this polished version of Annie and the focused professional I'd come to know created an unexpected cognitive disruption.

"Mr. Thompson, what do you think?" Vanessa prompted, interrupting my uncharacteristic mental wandering.

I registered the momentary lapse in my typical cognitive discipline and immediately reestablished control over my expression. "Very good,"I responded,maintaining my usual measured tone despite an unusual internal response I chose not to examine further. The styling team exchanged pleased glances before efficiently gathering their equipment. Within minutes, they had vacated the office, leaving Annie and me alone. She approached with measured steps, clearly unaccustomed to the formal footwear. Drawing a deep breath, she met my gaze directly. "Shall we go?" I extended my arm in a practiced gesture, noting the slight tremor in her hand as she placed it on my forearm. The involuntary physical response revealed her nervousness about the evening ahead-an understandable reaction given her limited exposure to high-society functions.

"Don't worry," I stated quietly, activating the reassurance protocol I typically reserved for Lucy's moments of anxiety. "Whatever happens,I'll protect you."

The tension in her shoulders eased fractionally. "All right then. I'm counting on you."




The Bentley glided to a stop at the entrance of the Huntington Estate,where the annual Children's Medical Research gala was being held.I exited first, circling the vehicle to open Annie's door personally-a deviation from standard protocol that felt appropriate for the evening's objectives.


Annie emerged carefully, instinctively aligning herself beside me as we approached the entrance. The evening air carried the fragrance of the estate's famous rose garden-hundreds of blooms climbing the wrought iron fencing that surrounded the property. The expansive grounds had been transformed for the occasion, with elegantly appointed tables arranged throughout the garden. A red carpet extended from the main gates to the grand ballroom, currently populated by a steady stream of New York's elite-business leaders, politicians, old-money families, and celebrities whose presence guaranteed media coverage for the charitable cause. We had barely stepped onto the carpet when I detected Annie's slight change in posture. Following her line of sight, I immediately identified the source of her discomfort-Philip Baker, positioned near the entrance, his attention fixed unmistakably in our direction.
Annie immediately redirected her gaze, a small but revealing gesture.

"He stalks you at the office when you're not attending events,." I observed quietly. "Then appears at events you do attend."

I modulated my voice to ensure privacy within our conversation. "Does it bother you?"

"Yes," Annie admitted simply.

"It reminds me of when Catherine Morgan used to follow me around,"I began, the comparison forming naturally.

"Are you talking about me?" Catherine's voice suddenly materialized from my peripheral vision, cutting my observation short.

I turned slightly to observe Catherine approaching. Her father, visible several yards behind her, appeared to be engaged with other guests.

"I was using you as an example," I stated neutrally despite being caught in an awkward conversational moment.

Catherine's eyes narrowed slightly in suspicion before she glanced between Annie and myself. With a final look that communicated mild indignation,she turned and departed toward her father's location.

Once Catherine had moved beyond hearing range, I returned to our previous topic, conscious that the interruption had created a natural opening for my planned proposition. "I understood your current feelings," I continued, referencing her confirmation about Philip's unwanted attention. "But I recognized then, as is relevant now, that without implementing a strategic solution..." I deliberately paused, allowing Annie to anticipate my conclusion. "Philip Baker will continue his pursuit indefinitely," I completed my analysis.

Annie's expression reflected genuine concern. "Do you have a suggestion?"

I paused deliberately. "We could pretend to be in a relationship."

Annie's eyes met mine directly, her gaze analytical rather than immediately dismissive. "Is that really appropriate?"

I applied the same methodical approach I would to any strategic challenge."There are multiple individuals in my professional and personal circles applying pressure regarding my marital status. By establishing a perceived relationship with you, that pressure would be significantly reduced."

I didn't verbalize the secondary benefit-that such an arrangement would simultaneously discourage Philip's continued pursuit-trusting Annie to recognize this obvious conclusion independently.

Annie appeared to conduct her own internal analysis.

Say yes. Please say yes. My heart shouldn't be racing like this over a business arrangement... but it is.

"All right," she agreed.
###Chapter 61: Charity Gala Part Two

Annie's POV

A delicious tingle of excitement ran through me as Howard and I entered the gala. His agreement to my becoming his "girlfriend" for the evening still felt surreal.

It's just pretend. I reminded myself firmly, tryingto temper the unexpected joy bubbling inside me.

This is about strategy, not feelings. Still, I couldn't help the small smile that played at my lips as Howard's hand rested lightly at the small of my back.guiding me through the glittering crowd.

My momentary happiness faltered when I noticed Philip watching us from across the room, his predatory gaze tracking our every movement.

"He's watching," I murmured.

"He's been tracking our movements since we arrived," Howard confirmed coolly.


Philip approached us directly. "I need to speak with you," he said,focusing solely on me.


Howard shifted slightly. "I believe anything concerning my girlfriend would naturally include me in the conversation," he replied smoothly.

Philip's head snapped toward Howard. "*Girlfriend?*" His gaze darted between us with sudden, desperate attention.


I reached for Howard's hand and interlaced our fingers. "Yes, we're seeing each other," I confirmed, my voice steady.

Philip stared at our joined hands. "That's not possible," he stated flatly. "I'm not entirely sure what you wanted to discuss," I redirected, "but I assume it has something to do with Sarah Johnson?"

"Sarah's actions were always in my best interest," Philip insisted defensively. "I hope you both aren't targeting her."

"I don't believe I have any reason to 'target' her," I replied, genuinely amused. "Philip, I let all that go when our divorce was finalized. What matters now is that I've moved forward with my life. And now I have a new relationship..."

"I believe I can state with reasonable certainty that I surpass you in most measurable criteria," Howard observed matter-of-factly. "Therefore, I can confidently assert that I possess the capability to maintain Annie's interest long-term."


"Impossible!" Philip sputtered.

"There's nothing impossible about it," I stated calmly."It wasn't until I began spending time with Howard that I understood what being truly cared for feels like."


Philip's face drained of color as Howard and I moved away.

As we navigated the ballroom, a distinguished gentleman approached us."Howard! Excellent timing."


"Charles," Howard acknowledged with a nod. "Allow me to introduce Annie Baker,my partner."

The word *partner* sent unexpected warmth cascading through me.My eyes darted to Howard's profile, studying the confident set of his jaw, the perfect posture that seemed as natural to him as breathing. Had anyone told me months ago that I'd be standing beside Howard Thompson as his date, I would have laughed at the absurdity. Yet here I was. In the months since joining Howard Technologies, I'd created a successful children's book series, helped develop educational content that children loved, and built a new life for myself. Perhaps I wasn't just the divorced, broken woman anymore. Perhaps I was becoming someone who could stand beside a man like Howard and not feel completely out of place.

*What if this wasn't pretend?* The thought slipped through my defenses before I could stop it. *What if we could be more than this arrangement?*I quickly pushed the dangerous idea away, but not before a flush of warmth colored my cheeks.

"Howard's partner! What a pleasure," Charles exclaimed. "This is quite unexpected."

A small cluster of guests quickly gathered around us. "So you're Howard's lady!" a woman exclaimed. "Let's toast to that!"

I accepted a champagne flute, but Howard smoothly intercepted it. "She doesn't drink," he stateddefinitively. "Anyone encouraging her to do so would be directly contravening my wishes."

The pressure instantly evaporated as guests murmured apologies.

"Baker is quite fortunate," someone commented. "Not many can claim to have won Howard Thompson's affections."


When we were alone, I asked, "Was refusing the champagne really necessary?"


"Absolutely,"Howard confirmed, with a hint of amusement. "What would be the purpose of achieving my current position if I couldn't protect my girlfriend from unwanted social pressure?"

"I didn't expect you to see it that way," I admitted. "You should eat something," he suggested. "I have several business matters to address. I'll rejoin you shortly." At a quiet table. I had barely started eating when Sarah Johnson sat beside me,her pregnancy prominently displayed in her designer gown.


"You're more ambitious than I gave you credit for," she observed silkily."Landing Howard Thompson so quickly... impressive strategy.Though we both know you're barely in his league."


I immediately stood, creating distance between us, but this time not from fear. For once, Sarah's attempts at intimidation felt hollow. I was no longer the vulnerable woman she had once targeted.

"Why the retreat?" Sarah asked with false concern. "Afraid to hear the truth? That a man like Howard Thompson is simply using you until someone more suitable comes along? Someone with the right background,connections,education..."


"I'm concerned about your baby," I replied evenly, unmoved by her attempt to undermine me. "I'd hate for you to deliberately harm your child and then attempt to blame me for it."

Sarah's expression froze momentarily.

"You haven't answered my question," she pressed, regaining her composure.


I met her gaze directly, feeling a newfound confidence surge through me.Six months ago, Sarah's words would have devastated me, confirming every insecurity. Now, they barely touched me.

"If your implication is that I pursued Howard strategically, what difference would it make? At least both of us were single when our relationship began," I pointed out, my voce steady and assured.

"Unlike some people who deliberately pursue married individuals. And as for not being in his league?" I smiled, surprising myself with how genuinely untroubled I felt. "Perhaps I'm exactly what Howard needs-someone who values honesty, loyalty, and genuine connection over social climbing. I've built a career on my own merits, Sarah. My illustrations are being published internationally now. I don't need to cling to a man for my identity or security anymore."

Sarah shifted tactics, her expression softening. "You keep bringing up the past, Annie. Could it be you're still not over Philip?"

"You've used that line before," I observed with a cold smile. "I have zero interest in Philip Baker. As for why I keep referencing your actions-if you're entitled to *do* those things, why shouldn't I be entitled to *speak*about them?"


I stood. "If you continue attempting to upset me. I'll simply request a microphone and share with everyone exactly what you did. In detail."

Sarah paled and hurried away.

Catherine dropped into the chair Sarah had vacated, complaining about her father's matchmaking attempts.


Before I could respond, Philip appeared, noticeably intoxicated."Ladies!"he announced too loudly. "Annie,we need to talk."

"Philip, you've had too much to drink," I observed quietly.

"No, I'm perfectly coherent," he insisted, slurring. "Those things you said earlier-about you and Howard-they can't be true. You're lying to me,aren't you?"


"I have no reason to lie to you," I replied, stepping back. "You simply aren t important enough in my life to warrant fabricating stories."

"Impossible!" he erupted. "Six years of marriage! You can't possibly have forgotten everything we shared so qulickly. Even if you don't love me anymore, you couldn't possibly have developed genuine feelings for someone else this soon!"

"For me, moving beyond our relationship hasn't been quick at all," I replied softly. "You seem to have forgotten the circumstances under which I met Howard-when you had thrown me out of ourhome,left me with nothing, nowhere to go..."

Philip flinched visibly.

"In six years of marriage, you never truly cared for me," I continued deliberately."Howard is different. He took me in, supported me through the darkest period of my life-when both my husband and son had betrayed me."


"When I think about the past now. I'm only grateful-grateful that I escaped that marriage, grateful that Howard and Lucy welcomed me into their lives."


Howard appeared beside me. "It's time for us to depart," he stated simply.

As we turned to leave, I noticed Catherine remained, facing Philip with newfound intensity.


"You should maintain distance from Annie going forward," she advised him coldly.

"This is between Annie and me. It doesn't concern you," Philip laughed bitterly.

"As Annie's friend, it absolutely concerns me," Catherine,responded,her voice hardening. "Don't mistake her kindness for weakness. She's chosen not to publicly expose your behavior, but I have no such reservations."

She moved closer to him. "Think carefully,Philip Baker. How would Wall Street react to learning about a man who betrayed his wife,conducted an affair with another man's spouse, and encouraged his five-year-old son to mistreat his mother? What would your investors think?"


Catherine smiled dangerously. "For your own sake, stay away from Annie."
###Chapter 62: Investigation

Philip's POV

I stood in the corner of the grand ballroom,watching Annie and Howard preparing to leave. They were positioned just far enough that I could overhear their conversation without being noticed. The crystal chandeliers cast a soft glow over the remaining guests, many still engaged in animated discussions about donations and networking opportunities.


"Tired?" Howard asked Annie, his voice carrying a gentleness I'd never heard in our business meetings. The transformation was jarring-this was the same man whose ruthless negotiation tactics had become legendary on Wall Street.


"A little," Annie replied with natural ease, "but it's been a lovely evening."

Howard nodded slightly. "I've had the driver prepare the car."

His hand rested lightly on the small of her back as he guided her toward the exit. That casual intimacy sent a sharp pain through my chest. That had once been my privilege. The simple gesture spoke volumes about their relationship-there was a comfort between them that felt alarmingly established.


"Lucy's probably asleep by now," Annie remarked, a soft smile illuminating her features. "She drew a picture at school today that she can't wait to show us."

"About the butterfly expedition?" Howard inquired, genuine interest evident in his tone.


Annie nodded, her expression brightening. "Who would have thought a child whe barely spoke could have so many stories to tell now."

"That's your doing," Howard responded with unmistakable admiration." You gave her security."

I clenched my fist involuntarily. Months ago, Annie had been my wife,with Brian as her only child. Now she spoke of another child as if that were her real family. The easy way they discussed Lucy felt like a deliberate erasure of our history together.

They reached the doorway, where Howard attentivelyadjusted Annie's shawl around her shoulders. "Warm enough?" he asked.

"Perfectly, thank you," Annie answered, looking up at him with warmth radiating from her eyes.

In that moment, I witnessed something I never thought possible-Howard Thompson's perpetually stern business expression softening into tenderness. I'd encountered him at several executive functions over the years,where he was consistently cold and calculating. But the smile he now directed at Annie left me thoroughly shaken.

"If anyone gives you trouble, remember my promise," Howard said softly. "I'll be right beside you."

"I know," Annie responded with complete certainty. "That means everything to me."

Hearing those words, I couldn't help but recall the final months of our marriage. Annie's face had always carried traces of exhaustion and tension then. Now she appeared thoroughly reassured by a simple promise from Howard. The realization stung like a physical wound.

They walked toward the exit, Howard's hand maintaining that protective position against her back. The possessiveness of the gesture was unmistakable yet somehow not overbearing-it communicated both care and respect.

I found myself remembering our early marriage. Annie's expectations had been remarkably simple: respect, affection, and fidelity. I had failed her on all counts.

As they disappeared through the doorway, I drew a deep breath. Annie had never been one to enter relationships carelessly. She'd taken nearly six months to fully open up to me when we first dated. Yet somehow she had accepted Howard this quickly...

A sudden thought struck me: Howard must be manipulating her. That cold-blooded businessman must have given her false promises. I'd heard rumors about his business practices-the dark transactions kept from public view. If Annie knew about those...

I needed to expose Howard's true nature. For Annie's sake, even if she currently despised me.



"Your ex-wife seems to have completely forgotten you," Sarah's voice suddenly came from behind me. interrupting my thoughts.

I turned to face her but didn't respond to her thinly veiled mockery. My mood was already foul, and I had no desire for conversation with anyone,especially her.

"Don't you think you're being presumptuous?" I confronted Sarah directly,my voice laden with barely contained irritation. She appeared entirely unsurprised by my hostility, maintaining perfect composure. This only fueled my annoyance further. "What gives you the right to interfere in matters between Annie and me?"I pressed, feeling deeply violated by her actions. Sarah's eyes darted quickly around us, ensuring no one was eavesdropping,before she leaned closer and lowered her voice. "I'm only thinking about our future."

"What's that supposed to mean?" I stared into her eyes,trying to decipher her true intentions.


After a moment of silence, Sarah suddenly straightened her posture,her expression becoming unusually serious. "Philip, we both know you're still in love with Annie, not me."


Her directness momentarily stunned me. Though I had previously confessed my feelings for Annie to her, hearing her acknowledge it so bluntly still made me uncomfortable.

"I've always known." Sarah continued, her eyes flickering with an emotion I couldn't quite identify. "Yet I chose to stay with you because..." her voice caught slightly.

I felt a wave of guilt wash over me. While I harbored no romantic feelings for Sarah,seeing her apparent vulnerability made me waver.

"Actually. I have a plan," she said after composing herself."I could approach Howard."

"What?" I furrowed my brow in confusion.

"Think about it," Sarah whispered conspiratorially. "If I could attract Howard's attention, make him leave Annie, wouldn't that give you another chance with her?" I studied Sarah's eyes carefully, searching for any sign of deception,but her gaze remained surprisingly sincere. "You would... do that for me?" I asked cautiously. Sarah managed a strained smile. "It benefits us both. You could reclaim Annie's love, while I... I could secure better financial stability." Hearing her explanation, I had to admit it presented a potentially winning strategy for both of us. Though I still questioned her motives, it seemed like our most viable option.

"It seems I misjudged your intentions," I admitted. "I apologize."

"No need," Sarah responded, relief crossing her features. "As long as you understand what I'm trying to do, I'mn satisfied."

Looking at her forced smile, I felt a new respect forming for her. Perhaps she genuinely was trying to help in her own way.

"After your child is born," I said seriously, "I'll provide not only child support but also cover some of your personal expenses."

Sarah's eyes widened slightly, seemingly surprised by my generosity.Her reaction appeared genuine, which made me feel better about our arrangement. I noticed a flash of something cross her eyes before they returned to their usual composed state.




I pulled out my phone and dialed Allen Stark, one of my most reliable connections on Wall Street. I walked to the terrace to ensure privacy for our conversation, the cool evening air providing welcome relief from the stuffy ballroom. "Allen, I need you to investigate Howard Thompson," I said in a hushed tone. "I want everything you can find. The more detailed, the better." Sarah had somehow followed me and now stood by my side. She suddenly leaned in and added, "Also find out what kind of women Howard prefers." I gave her a puzzled look, not understanding why she would focus on such a specific detail. Noticing my confusion, Sarah moved closer to whisper in my ear."Understanding his preferences will help me approach him more effectively.It increases my chances of distracting him, giving you more opportunities to reconnect with Annie."

Her explanation made logical sense. Indeed, if Sarah could capture Howard's attention, Annie would see his true colors.


"Allen, please also include the information Sarah mentioned," I added. "It's important."

"No problem," Allen replied efficiently. "I'll have preliminary results for you tomorrow. I'll put people on investigating his business background.personal life,and preferences."

"Thank you," I responded. "This means a great deal to me."


As I ended the call,I noticed a fleeting smile cross Sarah's lips before her expression returned to one of concern. Perhaps I had imagined it. After all,her willingness to help had already demonstrated her sincerity.I should trust her.

Whatever the cost. I was determined to uncover that man's true nature and bring Annie back to where she belonged.

I believed time would reveal everything. When the investigation concluded,when Annie saw the truth about Howard, she would understand that I was the one she should choose.
###Chapter 63: We Should Interact Like a Nrd Couple Would
Annie's POV

Back in my office at Howard Technologies, I carefully removed the last traces of makeup from the charity gala, feeling both relieved and slightly wistful as I changed back into my regular work clothes. The navy blue evening gown hung pristinely on a nearby rack, its elegant silhouette a reminder of last night's unexpected developments.


"The dress suits you," Howard commented from the doorway. "You should keep it."


I turned to face him, trying to ignore how his presence still made my heart skip slightly. "It's far too expensive for a single evening." I protested softly."I checked the label this morning -it's a custom piece worth nearly half a million dollars."


"Consider it a memento," he replied matter-of-factly. "My girlfriend's first gala dress deserves preservation,don't you think?"

The word 'girlfriend' sent an unexpected warmth through me, even as I reminded myself this was just pretense. "But we're not really..." I began.

"To make others believe we're dating." Howard stated matter-of-factly, "we should interact like a normal couple would."

My heart fluttered at his words. Even though I knew this was just pretense,the mere thought of acting like Howard's girlfriend sent a wave of warmth through me. The memory of lastnight-his steady presence beside me,his hand protectively at my back, the gentle way he'd adjusted my shawl-was still vivid in my mind. "Otherwise, they'll eventually notice something's off," he added when I remained silent, too caught up in my own thoughts to respond.

"How exactly should we do that?" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady despite the surge of anticipation coursing through me. Just playing at being Howard's girlfriend seemed dangerous - how long before these growing feelings became impossible to hide?

Howard's voice took on an almost hypnotic quality. "It's simple. Just treat me as your boyfriend in daily life."

*Just treat him as my boyfriend*. The suggestion made my pulse quicken.How many times had I caught myself already slipping into that mindset?Noticing the way his eyes softened when he looked at Lucy, admiring how his commanding presence filled a room, finding comfort in the quiet moments we shared on the terrace? This "pretense" felt like permission to acknowledge what I'd been trying so hard to ignore.

Even if I were to treat this relationship as real. I couldn't carelessly spend his money. After all... My entire month's salary,while generous,wouldn't cover even one ddress like this.


After careful consideration, I finally said, "Then in the future,please don't give me such expensive gifts."

"Otherwise,Philip will immediately know our relationship isn't real."

Howard looked puzzled."Why?” I explained patiently. "It's about reciprocity. Given my personality, when you give me something. I'll naturally want to give you something in return.And he knows about me." "If the gifts are too expensive. I won't be abe to reciprocate,so I won't accept them." Howard listened to my explanation, then smiled softly. "Alright then."




Later that afternoon, I waited outside the Upper East Side Private Preschoo1, watching as Lucy said goodbye to her friend Penny. The transformation in my daughter over these past months still amazed me -from a silent, withdrawn child to one who now had genuine friendships.

"Mom!" Lucy called out excitedly as she approached. "I have news!"

"What is it,sweetheart?"


"I was chosen for the school speaking competition," she announced proudly. Then her expression turned slightly uncertain. "But... Brian Baker will also be performing."

My heart clenched at the mention of my son's name, but I focused on keeping my expression encouraging. "Are you worried about that?"

Lucy shook her head slowly. "Not for me. I thought... it might make you sad."


The simple consideration in her words touched me deeply."Oh,Lucy," I knelt to her level, "don't worry about me. This is your moment to shine."
 
"Really?" She searched my face carefully. "Really," I confirmed. "I'mn so proud of you for being chosen. When is the competition?" "Next week," she replied, her excitement returning. "Can we practice at home?” "Of course we can." The Long Island estate glowed warmly in the evening light as we pulled up to the entrance. Lucy practically bounced out of the car, her earlier concerns forgotten in her enthusiasm to begin preparing for her speech.

We settled in the living room, surrounding ourselves with paper and pencils. Lucy's dedication to her studies contnued to amaze me-she attacked each new challenge with determination that belied her young age.


"Can we look up some words in the dictionary?" she asked, carefully writing out her speech ideas.


"Of course," I replied, reaching for the children's dictionary we kept nearby."Which words?"


"'Perseverance' and 'determination," she replied without hesitation. "I want to use big words in my speech."

As we worked through the definitions together. Lucy suddenly looked up."Mom,could we maybe get some elementary school books? For extra practice?"


Before I could respond, Howard spoke from where he'd been quietly observing. "I have something to show you both first."

He led us up to the third floor, stopping before a door I hadn't noticed before. When he opened it. Lucy gasped in delight. The room had been transformed into a magical playroom, filled with educational toys, art supplies, and what appeared to be every imaginable tool for creative learning. "Dad!" Lucy exclaimed, her eyes wide. "This is amazing!" Then,showing that remarkable matuity that still caught me off guard,she turned to Howard."Could Penny come play sometimes? She'd love these toys too." Howard's lips curved in that slight smile that I'd learned to recognize as genuine pleasure. "I thought you might ask that. That's why f ordered two
of everything."

Lucy's face lit up even brighter."Can I call her now?"

After getting our approval. Lucy carefully dialed Penny's number on the house phone. I listened as she excitedly described the playroom to her friend, then handed the phone to me so I could discuss arrangements with Sue Peterson.


"We'd be happy to have Penny visit," I assured Sue. "Edward and Eleanor have offered to handle the transportation."

As I finished coordinating details with Sue, I caught Howard watching me with an expression I couldn't quite read. When I raised an eyebrow in question, he simply shook his head slightly, that ghost of a smile still playing at his lips.

Later, watching Lucy carefully organize her new educational games, I felt an overwhelming surge of gratitude. Months ago, I'd been a broken woman, betrayed by my husband and son. Now, somehow, I'd found myself part of something that felt increasingly like a real family.

"Stop overthinking," Howard's quiet voice interrupted my reverie. As always, he'd read my expression perfectly.

"How do you always know?" I asked,genuinely curious. "You have a particular expression when you're analyzing things too deeply."he replied matter-of-factly. "Your brow furrows slightly,and you bite your lower lip." The fact that he'd noticed such small details about me sent an unexpected warmth through my chest. *This is just pretend*, I reminded myself firmly.But watching him help Lucy arrange her new toys, seeing the gentle patience in his interactions with her, I couldn't help but wish it wasn't.
###Chapter 64: Breaking Free

Brian's POV

I stood at my usual spot near the Upper East Side Private Preschool,watching Mom and Lucy from a distance. Lucy was showing Mom something she'd drawn - a butterfly, I think. Mom crouched down to Lucy's level, listening intently as the little girl gestured excitedly. The way Mom looked at Lucy, with such gentle warmth in her eyes, made my chest hurt.
"Your mother received the letter?" I asked Mitchell, our driver, without taking my eyes off them.

"Yes. young master. I delivered it personally and saw her take it inside."

I frowned, studying Mom's expression as she smiled at something Lucy said. "But she looks... normal. Like she never got it." My fingernails dug into my palms. "Maybe she threw it away without reading it."

"Perhaps she needs time," Mitchell suggested carefully.

I barely heard him. Watching Mom with Lucy brought back memories I'd been trying to forget: Mom reading me bedtime stories, her voice different for each character. Mom kissing my scraped knees better. Mom staying up late to help me with projects, even when she was tired from work. Mom always being there, until suddenly she wasn't. The familiar anger rose in my throat. They'd misled me about her. All those times they said Mom was boring and uninteresting, that she didn't know how to have fun, that our family would be happier without her-I'd believed them. I remembered now how Mom used to take extra illustration jobs, working late into the night. I'd thought she was just being boring and serious all the time, but now I understood-she'd been saving money for my future all along. Something caught in my chest as I watched Mom adjusting Lucy's backpack straps with gentle hands. Those same hands used to straighten my collar, brush my hair back from my face...

"Young master?" Wilson's voice pulled me from my thoughts. "Should we follow them today?"

I shook my head sharply. "No. Take me back to the car."

Once inside the vehicle, Mitchell studied me in the rearview mirror. "This is unusual for you. Normally at this time, you'd want to watch your mother for a while longer."

"I hate Dad!" The words burst out of me with surprising force. "He and Sarah made Mom seem so boring and unimportant. But they were wrong!Sarah's horrible. They workedtogether to make me think badly of Mom."My voice cracked. "I hate them both!"

Mitchell remained silent, but I could see concern in his eyes as he watched me through the mirror.

"She was saving money for me," I continued, quieter now. "All those times she worked so seriously-she wasn't being boring. She was trying to make sure I'd be okay." I swallowed hard. "We still have our old apartment, don't we? The one Mom and I lived in before?"

"Yes,young master."

"Take me there," I decided. "There's something I need to check." As we drove, I remembered more details about the apartment-how Mom had carefully explained that it would always be mine, no matter what happened. At the time, I hadn't understood why she'd seemed so serious about it. Now I did. My phone buzzed - Dad calling. I stared at the screen for a moment before answering.
 
"Brian? Where are you? You should be at your usual spot watching your mother by now."

I forced my voice to sound weak. "I'm at the hospital. My stomach really hurts."


"Hospital? Which one? I'll come right away-"

"No!" I interrupted quickly. "I mean... Ms. Taylor is with me. The doctor says it's just a small problem. I'll be fine after some rest."

There was a pause. "Are you sure? I can reschedule my meetings-"

"Please don't." I insisted. "I don't want to bother you. Ms. Taylor will take care of me."


After I hung up, guilt gnawed at my stomach for lying. But I couldn't let Dad interfere-not now, when I finally knew what I needed to do.

The apartment still smelled the same - like Mom's lavender candles and the old books she loved to read to me. Ms. Taylor, my tutor, helped me search through the study while Mitchell checked the master bedroom.

"Young master," Mitchell called after about an hour. "I foundsomething."

In Mom's old closet, behind a panel I never knew existed, we discovered a safe. The combination was my birthday - of course it was. Inside were exactly what I'd hoped to find; property documents, investment account details, and bank statements showing regular deposits Mom had made for years. My hands trembled as I read through the papers. Even after Dad asked her to leave, even when I was cold to her, Mom had kept adding to these accounts, There was enough here for me to live comfortably, to pay for my education, to be independent. "She never stopped thinking about my future," I whispered, more to myself than to Mitchell and Ms. Taylor. "Even when I.., when I was so cold to her..."

Ms. Taylor placed a gentle hand on my shoulder. "What would you like to do now?"

I straightened my spine, trying to look as grown-up as I felt in that moment. "I want to live here. Away from Dad and Sarah." I turned to face them both. "Will you help me? I'll double your salaries - I can afford it now. You've both been so kind to me, even when I was... difficult."

They exchanged glances before Mitchell spoke. "Young master, are you certain about this? Your father will be very angry."

"I don't care!" But my voice shook slightly. "I can't stay there anymore,watching them talk badly about Mom. Dad doesn't really want me - he just wants to use me to make Mom feel bad." I took a deep breath. "Please.You're the only ones who've always been honest with me."

Ms. Taylor nodded slowly. "We'll help you. But we'll need to plan this carefully."

As they discussed logistics -what to move first, how to arrange schedules,which stories to tell Dad - I walked through the apartment, remembering.Here was where Mom and I used to have breakfast together. There was where we'd build blanket forts on rainy days. The wall still had marks showing how I'd grown taller over the years.

I stopped in front of my old bedroom. The last time I'd been here,I'd acted cold toward Mom, told her I didn't want to be around her. I'd believed what they said about her being boring and uninteresting. I'd been so stupid.

Tears burned in my eyes as I thought about how Mom must have felt, seeing me act that way. How much it must have hurt when I was cold to her, when I told everyone at school that she wasn't fun to be around.And still, she'd kept adding money to these accounts, kept making sure I'd be taken care of.

"I'm sorry, Mom," I whispered to the empty room. "I'm so sorry."
 ###Chapter 65: Between Real and Pretense

Annie's POV

Penny's dramatic gasp echoed through the third-floor playroom as Lucy showed off their new domain. "This is better than a real theater!" she exclaimed, immediately striking a pose worthy of Broadway. I leaned against the doorframe, watching as the aspiring young actress surveyed her new stage with professional scrutiny.

"Let's pretend we're in a magical palace," Penny suggested,arranging the dolls in a circle. "These can be the royal family."


"The princess needs a best friend," Lucy added softly, carefully placing anotherdoll next to Penny's princess. Her eyes lit up as she spoke,a far cry from her usual reserved demeanor.


I watched as their story unfolded. The princess and her friend discovered a magical garden,rescued a fairy from an evil spell, and hosted a grand celebration - all through the voices of their dolls. Lucy followed Penny's lead naturally, adding her own ideas in a way that still surprised me.

"The princess is lonely in her big palace," Penny declared dramatically.making her doll pace back and forth.

Lucy picked up her doll and made it hug the princess. "Don't worry.I'll always be your friend," she said, her voice carrying such sincerity that my heart melted.

They played until both were tired out. Penny flopped onto the carpet first her limbs sprawled like a starfish. Lucy hesitated for just a moment before lying down next to her, mirroring her position. They didn't speak, didn't move -just existed together in comfortable silence. Looking at them, I realized Lucy had found something precious: a friend who understood her without words. "Annie." Howard's quiet voice drew my attention to where he stood in the hallway. With a subtle gesture, he directed my gaze toward Edward and Eleanor Parker, Lucy's grandparents,who were watching the girls from the opposite doorway.

The change in them was remarkable. When I'd first met them, both had carried the heavy weight of grief, their daughter's loss evident in every tired line of their faces. Now, observing their granddaughter's animated play and natural happiness, their expressions had softened. Eleanor's hand rested on her husband's arm, and though neither smiled openly,the rigid tension that had characterized their posture had eased considerably.

I stepped back quietly, unwilling to intrude on this moment of healing.This too was Howard's doing - his careful orchestration creating an environment where Lucy could help mend her grandparents' broken hearts while finding her own voice again.


This was what healing looked like, I realized. A little girI playing freely,grandparents rediscovering joy, a family slowly knitting itself back together.
The warmth of it filled me completely - not just because Lucy was happy,but because I was part of this. Part of a real family, messy and complicated and wonderful.

Watching them, I finally understood what had been missing in my previous marriage. This wasn't about perfect appearances or social status.It was about belonging, about hearts connecting. About finding home in each other's presence




As evening approached, Howard led me to the second-floor terrace. The setting sun cast long shadows across the manicured grounds, painting everything in soft golden light. I was acutely aware of his presence beside me-the subtle cologne he wore, the warmth radiating from his tall frame. "Your hand," he stated simply, extending his own toward me.

Before I could question his intent, he added in a lower voice, "Philip has been following you. He's watching from the south gardens right now."

My eyes instinctively started to turn in that direction, but Howard's hand gently caught my chin. "Don't look," he murmured. "Act natural."

I found myself studying his fingers - long, elegant, yet unmistakably strong. When our palms met, an electric curent seemed to race up my arm.His hand completely enveloped mine, the size difference sending an unexpected thrill through me.

Without warning, he drew me onto his lap. The sudden intimacy made my breath catch- I could feel the solid muscle of his thighs beneath me,the breadth of his chest against my back. His breath ghosted across my ear as he spoke: "Don't mnove,Annie."

My heart thundered against my ribs. This was supposed to be pretense, I reminded myself desperately. Just a show for Philip, who I knew was watching from somewhere in the distance. But my body's response felt anything but artificial.

"Tell me," Howard's voice dropped lower, "did Philip ever make you feel like this?"

The question should have angered me, but instead sent heat flooding through my veins. "No," I admitted, surprising myself with my honesty. In six years of marriage, Philip had never sparked this kind of raw awareness in me.

Howard's lips brushed my neck - the barest touch, yet it sent shockwaves through my system. Before I could process the sensation, he turned me in his arms and claimed my mouth with his. The kiss was controlled yet passionate, his expertise evident in every movement. My hands found their way to his chest of their own accord, feeling the strong, steady beat of his heart beneath my palms.

"Annie," Howard's voice was gentle as he stepped back slightly, though his hand remained protectively at my waist. "Are you all right?"

The genuine concern in his tone made my heart flutter. Even in this "pretend" relationship, his consideration felt real. I could still feel Philip's gaze burning into us from across the room, but somehow it mattered less and less.


"I'm fine," I assured Howard, surprised to find it was true. For the first time since my divorce, I feltgenuinely secure. Protected. Not because Howard was acting as a shield against my past, but because his steady presence gave me the strength to face it myself.

"Philip is still watching," Howard observed quietly, his thumb tracing a soothing pattern against my waist.

"Let him," I replied with newfound confidence. "I don't care anymore."

Howard's eyes searched mine, and something in his expression softened."Your courage continues to impress me," he said simply.

The quiet sincerity in his voice warmed me more than any passionate display could have. In that moment, I realized how dangerously close I was to forgetting this was all pretense. The way Howard looked at me,the gentle strength of his touch, the careful attention he paid to my comfort-it felt too real to be an act.

"We should join the others," I suggested, though I made no move to step away from him.

Howard nodded but didn't immediately release me. "Remember," he said softly,"I meant what I said. I'll protect you."
She's Mine

Philip's POV

The privet hedge provided perfect cover as I watched Annie through the second-floor windows of Howard Thompson's Long Island estate. My expensive Italian leather shoes were ruined by the damp earth, but I barely noticed. All my attention was focused on tracking her movements through the house.


My phone vibrated.Sarah.

"What kind of flowers does Annie like?"she asked without preamble.

The question caught me off guard. "What?"

"Annie. Your ex-wife. What kind of flowers does she prefer?" Sarah's tone carried an edge of impatience.

I frowned, trying to recall. Had Annie ever mentioned favorite flowers? She must have, during our sixyears of marriage, but I drew a blank.

"Does she like classical music?" Sarah pressed when I remained silent."What about art? Fashion preferences?"

"Why do yo care about Annie's tastes?" I demanded, irritation rising.

"Research," Sarah replied smoothly. "When I see her again, I want to have conversation topics ready. You know how these things work -the more you can relate to someone's interests, the easier it is to build rapport."

Her words triggered a sudden memory; Annie excitedly showing me her new illustration portfolio, her eyes bright with passion as she explained each piece. I'd barely glanced at it, muttering something about being too busy with work.

"Besides," Sarah continued, her voice taking on a calculatng tone, "don't you think Howard Thompson would be more likely to notice me if I shared some of Annie's... qualities?"

The implication made my stomach turn. "You want to copy Annie?"

"Not copy exactly," Sarah corrected. "Just... incorporate certain elements.The things that clearly appeal to Howard. Her style, her mannerisms..."She paused deliberately. "The way she carries herself."


I remembered how Annie used to approach everything with quiet determination. Even when I'd been cruel- and I could admit now that I had been cruel-she'd maintained her dignity. Howard clearly valued that quality in her.

"She was always reading," I found myself saying. "Children's books mostly,studying illustration styles. And she loved the scent of lilacs..." My voice trailed off as I realized how little attention I'd paid to her interests during our marriage.

"Perfect," Sarah purred. "What else?"

"She pursued me first," I admitted, the words spilling out unexpectedly."She was so genuine in her affection. After we married, she was unfaiingly kind, always putting my needs first..."

"And you took it for granted," Sarah finished when I fell silent.

"Yes." The admission felt like swallowing glass. "Whenever she wanted to celebrate holidays or create special moments, I'd dismiss her. Claim I was too busy with work, or that I just didn't understand romantic gestures. She always forgave me."

"How convenient for you," Sarah observed dryly. "And now Howard Thompson is reaping the benefits of your negligence."

As if summoned by her words, movement on the second-floor terrace caught my eye. Howard appeared, leading Annie by the hand. My throat constricted as I watched him draw her onto his lap.

"I have to go," I choked out, ending the call.

The scene before me was torture, yet I couldn't look away. Howard's hand rested possessively on Annie's waist -*my* Annie's waist. When he kissed her neck, bile rose in my throat. My hands trembled violently as I gripped the hedge branches, barely registering the thorns cutting into my palms.

Then Howard turned her in his arms and claimed her mouth. The kiss was clearly passionate-I could see Annie's hands pressed against his chest, not pushing him away but drawing him closer. My vision blurred,tears of rage burning my eyes.

*This isn't happening. This can't be happening.*

But it was. I watched, my chest constricting painfully, as Annie melted into Howard's embrace. The intimacy of their interaction was undeniable.This wasn't some business arrangement or casual flirtation - the way they moved together spoke of genuine connection.

She was truly slipping away from me. Annie would never forgive me now..



She had a new life, a new love.

With trembling fingers, I dialed my friend's number. "Do you have any results from the investigation I requested?"

"Brother, it hasn't even been a day!" The exasperation in his voice was clear. "How could I possibly have anything yet?"

"Just wait a bit longer."

Though I could hear the frustration in his tone, I pressed on desperately." But I need it as soon as possible."

I couldn't bear watching Howard and Annie interact as a couple any longer. Howard's excellence was undeniable - if I allowed Annie to keep spending time with him...her love for him would eventually surpass what she once felt for me.

By then, I'd have no chance at all.

But I had to try! I couldn't just watch helplessly as Annie belonged to someone else.


"Fine," my friend sighed. "I'll work overtime on this for you these next few days."

"Thank you." I continued staring at them masochistically.

The day I got the evidence, I would take it straight to Annie.Once she became disillusioned with Howard, I wouldn't have to watch them being intimate anymore... I wouldn't have to feel this agonizing pain.

Most importantly, that would be my chance to appear by Annie's side,to comfort her properly. She would surely be moved by my devotion and fall in love with me again.

The thought finally lifted my spirits slightly.

Then I watched as Howard lifted Annie into his arms. She buried her face in his chest as they disappeared from the terrace.

What were they going to do?

I lurched forward, my feet carrying me toward the front entrance before my brain could process the action. The security guard's hand on my chest brought me up short.

"Sir, this is private property," he stated firmly. "I need to see Annie," I gasped, my breathing ragged, "Annie Baker. She's inside with Howard Thompson."

"Ms. Baker is not available," the guard replied, his expression hardening."Please leave the premises immediately."

Humiliation burned through me as I stumbled backward. My trembling fingers found my phone, desperately dialing Howard's number.

It rang once. Twice. Three times.

"Thompson speaking." His voice was calm, controlled - asif he hadn't just been kissing my wife. *Ex-wife*, a traitorous voice in my mind corrected.

"Stay away from her," I snarled, my voice barely recognizable to my own ears. "She's mine. She'lI always be mine."

There was a brief pause before Howard replied, his tone carrying a dangerous edge. "Mr. Baker, you appear to be experiencing some confusion about boundaries. Allow me to clarify: Annie is not your property. She never was. Furthermore, any attempt to harass or intimidate her will be met with immediate legal consequences. Do we understand each other?"


The line went dead before I could respond. I doubled over, violent tremors wracking my body as I pictured Howard returning to Annie, touching her,loving her in ways I never had.


*She's mine*, I thought desperately. *Mine. And I'll make her remember that. Whatever it takes,*
###Chapter 67: Unexpected Interruption

Howard's POV

I ended the call with Philip Baker, his desperate threats still echoing in my mind: "She's mine. She'll always be mine." The possessiveness in his voice triggered an unfamiliar surge of anger that I carefully controlled.

Annie stood watching me, her expression a mix of concern and something else that made my usual analytical detachment waver.

"Your ex-husband seems unable to accept your happiness," I observed,keeping my tone measured despite my lingering irritation.

Annie laughed softly. "He probably can't stand seeing me better off than before."


I studied her face. The defensive tension that had characterized her early days at Howard Technologies was gone. She'd grown stronger,more confident. The transformation was... satisfying to witness.

"He indeed lacks the capacity to provide you with an improved quality of life," I stated. The words came out more intensely than intended.

"Perhaps he just wanted me to witness his 'perfect love story' with Sarah."Her voice carried amusement rather than pain now.


I moved closer, drawn by an impulse I didn't bother analyzing. "Perhaps we should consider making this arrangement more permanent."


A blush colored her cheeks. Her eyes met mine, carrying equal measures of anticipation and hesitation. My pulse quickened - an unusual physiological response that I chose not to examine too closely.

*Say yes*,I thought. *Just nod. I know you feel it too, Annie. This stopped being pretense long ago.* "Dad! Mom!" Lucy's voice interrupted the moment. She appeared with Penny close behind. "Penny's tired. Can we take her home now?"

Annie stepped back quickly, her hand rising to her flushed cheek. I suppressed a flash of frustration at the timing.

"Of course, sweetheart," Annie replied, her voice slightly unsteady.




In the car, Penny and Lucy's excited chatter filled the back seat despite their obvious fatigue.

"And when the fairy queen granted us three wishes," Penny was saying,"we used the first one to make all the flowers sing!"

"The second wish was for butterfly wings," Lucy added softly.

"Mom can play these games with me now," Penny said. "Ever since she started working at Thompson uncle's company, she smiles a lot more."

"Just like my mom," Lucy agreed, reaching for Annie's hand.

Penny turned to me. "Thank you, Thompson uncle, for helping my mom."

The simple sincerity in her voice caught me off guard. Through the mirror,
I saw Annie's expression soften in a way that made my chest tighten unexpectedly.

The girls drifted to sleep, Lucy's head resting on Penny's shoulder. I found myself imagining more evenings like this - Annie beside me, Lucy happy and secure. The domesticity of the thought should have alarmed me.Instead,it felt right.




The evening's tranquility shattered as we approached Sue Peterson's apartment building. The security door stood conspicuously ajar, its lock visibly damaged. Something was wrong.

"Annie." I kept my voice deliberately calm. "Stay here with the children.Lock the doors."

She caught my eye in the rearview mirror, understanding immediately. "Five minutes before I call the police?"

I nodded once. "Exactly."

Lucy's small hand caught my sleeve. "Dad..."

"Everything will be fine," I assured her, noting how she pressed closer to Penny, both girls drawing comfort from each other's presence.

The stairwell would be quieter than the elevator. Fourth floor,west corridor. Dave's raised voice carried clearly through the damaged door.

"You think you can just cut me off?" His words dripped with drunken rage. "After everything I've done for you?"

Sue's response was too quiet to discern, but the underlying fear was evident.Something crashed against a wall.

"The money stops when I say it stops!" Dave's voice rose to a roar."You think you're better than me now? With your fancy new job and your rich friends?"


A cold fury settled over me at the sound of another crash. Without hesitation, I kicked the door open.

The scene froze: Sue bound to a kitchen chair with what appeared to be a necktie, Dave looming over her with his fist raised.

His head snapped toward me, face contorting through a fapid succession of emotions - surprise, fear, then misplaced bravado."Who the hell do you think you are?" he snarled, taking an unsteady step forward. "This is a private matter between me and my wife!"

"Ex-wite," I corrected coldly, "whom you're currently assaulting."

Dave's face flushed an ugly red. "You don't know anything!" he shouted,gesturing wildly, "She owes mel After everything I've done, all the sacrifices T've made "


I didn't let him finish. One precise kick sent him stumbling backward.His eyes widened in shocked outrage as he clutched his stomach.


"You,,. you can't..," he wheezed, face alternating between pale and flushed."Do you know who I am?"

"A coward who threatens women," I stated flatly, advancing toward him."Who breaks into homes and demands money he hasn't earned."


Dave's expression twisted into something ugly. "She's nothing without me!I made her what she is!" He lunged forward unsteadily. "You think you can just-"


Another kick dropped him to his knees. His bravado crumbled into sniveling panic. "Wait, please... I didn't mean... I was just..."

I looked at Sue, still bound to the chair, trembling but unharmed."Annie and the others are waiting outside," I told her calmly. "Let them help you get those ropes off."


Sue nodded frantically,relief flooding her features as she managed to stand,still tied to the chair, and made her way carefully toward the door.

"Thank you," Sue whispered, hurrying toward the door.

I turned back to Dave, who had pressed himself against the wall, all his earlier bravado replaced by naked fear. His eyes darted between me and the exit like a cornered animal.

"Wait..." he stammered. "We can talk about this... I was just upset... I didn't really mean to..."


I advanced slowly, my expression making it clear that the time for talk had passed.

I'd make sure he would learn his lesson this time.
###Chapter 68: So Is It That You Don't Love Da
Annie's POV

My heart thundered against my ribsas I watched Howard disappear into Sue's apartment building. The damaged security door swung lazily on íts hinges, a stark reminder of Dave's violent intrusion. Lucy and Penny huddled together in the back seat, their small hands clasped tightly.

"Should we call the police now?" Lucy whispered, her voice carrying that remarkable maturity that still caught me off guard.

Before I could answer, Sue burst through the security door, still partially bound to a kitchen chair with what appeared to be a necktie. Her usually immaculate appearance was disheveled, face pale with fear. Without hesitation, I jumped out to help her.

"Are you hurt?" I asked, quickly working to loosen the makeshift restraints.

Sue shook her head, though her hands trembled violently. "He... he was waiting when I got home. Said he needed money." Her voice cracked. "I've been trying so hard to build a new life, to show Penny that we don't need...



"Mommy?" Penny's worried voice carried from the car. "Is it the bad man again?"


Sue's expression crumpled at her daughter's words. "Everything's fine,sweetheart," she called back, though her voice wavered. "Just stay in the car with Lucy."


I finished freeing Sue from the chair just as heavy footsteps echoed from the stairwell. Dave emerged first, stumbling backward, with Howard following in measured steps. The contrast between them was stark -Dave's disheveled aggression against Howard's controlled power. "You can't do this!" Dave slurred, his earlier bravado reduced to desperate threats. "She's my wife!"

"Ex-wife," Howard corrected coldly. "A distinction you seem unable to grasp."

Something in Howard's tone made my pulse quicken. I'd seen him command boardrooms and navigate corporate takeovers,but this was different. This wasn't the calculated CEO- this was raw protective instinct barely contained by civilized restraint.

"You think you're better than me?" Dave sneered, though he kept retreating from Howard's advance. "Coming here in your fancy suit,playing hero? I know what you really want. Think you can buy her with that cushy job?"

Howard's expression didn't change, but something dangerous flickered in his eyes. "Ms. Peterson is a valued employee whose safety and wellbeing are my concern. Your implications say more about your character than mine."


Police sirens wailed in the distance, growing closer. Dave's face contorted with panic as he realized his situation. He lunged forward suddenly, but Howard intercepted him with practiced ease, pinning him against the wall until uniformed officers flooded the entrance.

As the police led Dave away in handcuffs, the building's security team finally appeared, looking distinctly uncomfortable under Sue's withering glare.


"I pay premium rates for security," she stated, her professional composure returning now that the immediate danger had passed. "Yet you let an unauthorized person enter without proper verification?"

The head of security shifted uneasily. "He said he was your husband,ma'am. Had some story about Penny leaving her backpack..."

"And you didn't think to call and confirm?" Sue's voice carried the sharp edge I recognized from corporate negotiations. "What exactly am I paying for if you can't perform basic identity verification?"

While Sue dealt with the security team, I found myself studying Howard.He stood slightly apart, his usual pristine appearance barely disturbed despite the physical confrontation. Something about seeing him like this-protective, powerful, yet perfectly controlled - made my heart race in a way that had nothing to do with the evening's drama.

I remembered our conversation about pretending to be a couple, how clinical and strategic it had seemed at the time. But watching him now,I couldn't ignore how real it felt when he held me at the charity gala. The way my body responded to his touch hadn't been pretense at all.




The next morning, I paused outside Lucy's bedroom,caught off guard by the sound of her practicing her speech. Her voice carried clearly through the partially open door, confident in a way that still amazed me after her months of silence.


"The butterfly starts as a tiny egg," she read carefully, "but through determination and patience, it transforms into something beautiful."

My throat tightened with emotion. How far she'd comne from the silent,withdrawn child I'd first met. Now here she was, preparing for a public speaking competition.


"Mom?" Lucy caught my eye in the mirror as she adjusted her dress."How was that?"

"Beautiful, sweetheart," I said honestly, moving to help her with a stubborn button. "Your delivery gets stronger every day." She beamed at the praise, then fell quiet as she watched me in the mirror.After a moment, she spoke again, her voice thoughtful. "Mom, what happens after people get divorced?"

The question caught me off guard, but I tried to keep my voice steady."What do you mean,sweetheart?"


"Like... with money and stuff," she elaborated, fidgeting with her sleeve."Penny said her mom didn't have any money saved up when se left her dad. That's why the bad man could be mean to her last night."

My heart ached at her precocious understanding. "That's a very grown-up observation," I said carefully. "But you don't need to worry about Sue. She has a good job now, and people who will protect her."

Lucy nodded, but her expression remained serious. "But it got me thinking..."She turned to face me directly. "We're kind of like Penny's family,aren't we? Sort of... but not really?"

"What do you mean?"

"Well, I call you Mom, and I call him Dad," she explained with child-like logic. "We live together in the same house... we're a family, right? But you're not married like other parents."

I felt my chest tighten. "Lucy..."

"If you're not married," she continued, her voice taking on a slight edge of worry, "what happens if something goes wrong? Like with Penny's parents?"

"That's... that's different," I tried to explain, though my own heart was racing now.

Lucy's eyes narrowed with determination. "Then why aren't you married?I'm going to ask Dad why he hasn't married you yet." "Lucy, wait," I caught her arm gently. "Marriage... marriage isn't just about living together or being a family. It needs love."


"But don't you love each other?" she asked, her eyes wide with genuine confusion. "Is that the problem? You don't love Dad? Or..." her voice dropped to a whisper, "Dad doesn't love you?"


The innocent question forced me to confront feelings I'd been carefully avoiding. Our arrangement with Howard had started as a simple solution-a shield against Philip's increasingly desperate attempts to insert himself back into my life. Astrategic move, nothing more.


But somewhere along the way, the lines had blurred. I found myself watching him when he wasn't looking, memorizing the way his expression softened when Lucy showed him her drawings, how his hand felt protective and warm against my back when we walked together. The way my heart raced when he kissed me at the charity gala hadn't been pretense at all.


Last night, seeing him protect Sue with such controlled power, I'd felt something shift inside me. The truth was, I wanted this pretense to be real.I wanted lazy Sunday mornings and shared coffee and quiet evening conversations that didn't end. I wanted...

But could I risk the peaceful life we'd built? Lucy was finally thriving,my career was blossoming, and for the first time since my divorce, I felt truly secure. Opening my heart again meant risking everything - not just for me,but for Lucy too. The memory of my failed marriage with Philip still cast long shadows over any thoughts of romance.


Before I could untangle these conflicting emotions, a shadow fell across the doorway.Howard stood there, his expression unreadable as his eyes met mine in the mirror. My heart stuttered in my chest as Lucy's question seemed to echo in the suddenly thick air between us: "So is it that you don't love Dad, or Dad d oesn't love you?" The answer caught in my throat, too dangerous to voice, too powerful to deny.
###Chapter 69: Six Years of Marriage

Philip's POV

My hands clenched the phone until the case creaked. Howard's cold dismissal burning in my ears. Annie was with him now.M∗Annie.In his bed. The thought sent waves of nausea through me as rage and grief clawed at my chest. She was supposed to be mine forever-the divorce papers shouldn't have changed that.

"How dare she?" I snarled into the darkness of my car, my voice raw and unfamiliar. Divorced or not, this was betrayal. Six years of marriage, and now she was spreading her legs for that cold bastard? The steering wheel groaned under my grip as violent images flooded my mind- Howard touching her, kissing her, taking what belonged to mne. Red tinged the edges of my vision as an animal sound of pain escaped my throat.

They were probably doing it right now, her body welcoming him like she used to welcome me. The thought sent me spiraling into a pit of rage and despair so deep I could barely breathe. It didn't matter that we'd been divorced for months. In my heart, in the only truth that mattered, she was still my wife.


Ten minutes later, I burst into the private room of our usual club,where Allen waited with several other friends. The expensive whiskey was already laid out-they knew me well enough to anticipate my needs.

"She's really left me," I choked out, my voice rough with emotion as I collapsed into a chair. The words hung heavy in the air of the private room,joining the haze of cigarette smoke from Allen's expensive cigars. "Annie's actually gone."

Allen shifted uncomfortably in his seat, clearly unsure how to handle my uncharacteristic display of vulnerability. I couldn't blame him -I barely recognized myself. The successful CEO of Philip Investment Group reduced to a drunken mess in a private club room at midnight.

"How could she just,,, stop loving me?" The words spilled out, bitter and raw, "Six years of marringe. Six years where she gave me everything. Her devotion, her kindness.." My hand trembled as I reached for the bottle again."And now she's with "him*,"

The memory of Howard's hands on Annle's waist, his lips against her neck,sent a fresh wave of nausea through me that had nothing to do with the alcohol. "They're probably together right now," I said, my voice cracking. "In his bed..."


"Annie was always too simple for someone like you," Allen began cautiously."A small-town girl who couldn't understand our world. Maybe this is for the best-"


"Don't." I cut him off sharply, an unexpected surge of protectiveness rising through my drunken haze. "You don't get to talk about her like that. None of you do." The same friends who'd encouraged my affair with Sarah,who'd laughed about Annie's 'provincial' background at dinner parties - they had no right to judge her. "She was worth ten of Sarah,and I was too blind to see it."

The irony wasn't lost on me - defending the woman I'd betrayed to the friends who'd encouraged that betrayal. But the thought of anyone speaking ill of Annie made my blood boil. She'd been perfect. The problem had been me, though I couldn't bring myself to fully admit it even now.

"The investigation is still ongoing," Allen offered carefully. "These things take time if we want thorough results..."

I barely heard him, lost in memories of Annie's smile, the way she used to look at me with such pure affection. When had I stopped noticing? When had I started taking her devotion for granted? My phone buzzed - my mother's name lighting up the screen. I almost ignored it. but years of ingrained filial obligation had me answering automatically.


"Philip," my mother's volce carried that familiar note of barely concealed disapproval. "I've been thinking about your situation with Sarah."

I pressed my fingers against my temples, trying to ward off the approaching headache. "Mother,please..."

"You two should reconcile," she continued as if I hadn't spoken. "It's the sensible solution. Sarah knows how to behave appropriately in our social circle, unlike..." She left Annie's name unspoken but clearly implied.

"I can't," I replied, the words scraping my throat.

"Philip, you need to stop this obsession with Annie. It's beneath you."Mother's voice turned sharp. "After eveything she's done? Cutting off contact with her own son? Sarah at least knows how to properly care for Brian."


"She was my first love," I said slowly, each word deliberate despite my drunken state: "My white moonlight. I thought having her would make me happy..." A bitter laugh escaped me. "But I ruined everything."

"Philip-"

"Stop pushing, Mother," I interrupted, surprising us both with mny firmness."I won't doit."


The line went dead. I stared at the phone, momentarily shocked by my own defiance. The room spun slightly as I stood, waving off Allen's concerned gesture.


Mother's words echoed in my head as I ended the call:"Philip,you need to stop this obsession with Annie. It's beneath you." Beneath me? I laughed bitterly, the sound harsh in the emptiness of my penthouse. The same penthouse that had once been filled with Annie's presence - her books scattered on coffee tables, her illustration supplies neatly organized in the corner desk, the gentle scent of her lavender candles lingering in every room.

The contrast between Annie and Sarah struck me with sudden clarity.Annie, who had worked tirelessly, saving money for Brian's future while managing our home. Sarah, whno seemed to view my credit cards as her personal shopping account, who treated my son as a mere prop in her calculated performance of devoted stepmother.

My phone buzzed with another text from Sarah - something about needing funds for new furniture. I ignored it, my thoughts fixed on the memory of Annie at the gala. The quiet confidence she'd carried herself with,so different from Sarah's practiced seduction. Had Annie always possessed that strength, and I'd been too blind to see it?

"One more drink," I muttered, reaching for the crystal decanter. The whiskey burned going down, but it couldn't erase the image of Howard's hands on Annie's waist, the way she'd melted into his kiss.

Annie never looked at me that way, a traitorous voice whispered in my mind. Even when things were good between us, she never seemed so...complete.


The room spun slightly as I stood. Allen - or was it Marcus?-had insisted on driving me home after finding me at the bar. "You're in no state to drive," he'd said, his voice carrying equal parts concern and judgment. "What's happened to you, Philip?"

What had happened? I'd lost everything that mattered while chasing things that didn't. The morning light stabbed at my eyes as consciousness crept back unwelcome. My head throbbed in time with my heartbeat,mouth dry as sand. For a moment, in that hazy space between sleep and waking, I could almost hear Annie's voice: "You've been drinking again...look how much pain you're in..."

The phantom comfort was worse than the hangover.How many times had she nursed me through mornings like this? Her gentle hands pressing aspirin into my palm, her quiet movements as she drew the curtains against the cruel sunlight. I'd never properly thanked her for any of it.

The drive to Howard Technologies felt endless. Every red light was another opportunity for my mind to torture me with images of Annie and Howard together. Her smile - the one that used to be mine- now directed at him. Her trust, her affection, everything I'd carelessly discarded,now given to a man who clearly knew their worth.

"Six years," I whispered to my reflection in the rearview mirror. "Six years of marriage and I'm only now understanding what I had."

The sight of her with Howard made breathing difficult. The casual intimacy between them at the gala had been bad enough, but knowing they were probably sharing a bed now... The steering wheel creaked under my white-knuckled grip.

Howard Technologies' underground parking garage was quiet at this early hour. I recognized his reserved space, positioned my car to block the entrance. My heart pounded as I waited, rehearsing what I'd say when I saw Annie. I had to make her understand - I'd been a fool, but I could change.I would change.


For the first time, a terrifying thought crossed my mind: What if it was already too late?
###Chapter 70:A Child's Questions

Howard's POV

I watched Lucy standing in the hallway, her hands clasped tightly behind her back - a nervous habit she'd picked up recently. Her question about Annie and me still lingered: "So is it that you don't love Dad, or Dad doesn't love you?"

I'd witnessed Annie's momentary paralysis at those words, seen the complicated emotions flickering across her face before she'd managed to redirect Lucy's attention to breakfast. But Lucy,showing that remarkable persistence that sometimes made me forget her age, hadn't let the subject drop.


"Dad?" Lucy's voice drew me from my thoughts as she approached, her school uniform already perfectly arranged - another habit she'd picked up from Annie. "Can we talk?"


I nodded, recognizing the determined set of her jaw. "Of course.Would you like to use the study?"

She nodded firmly. Once inside, she climbed into her usual leather chair -the one that made her look even smaller. When had I started thinking of it as hers?


"Mom wouldn't answer my question," Lucy said bluntly. "About whether you love each other."

I kept my face neutral, though her directness caught me off guård."What made you think about this?"


"Because of Penny's dad," she frowned. "He was mean to Penny's mom because they weren't married anymore. But you and Mom aren't married at all." The child's logic made me pause. "Lucy, adult relationships are complicated."

"But you *are* dating Mom, right? Her fingers twisted in her skirt. "That s what everyone says."

I studied her worried face. "Yes, we are."

"Then why don't you kiss her more? Or hold hands?" Lucy's frown deepened. "Other parents do that."

Her words hit something inside me. How many times had I wanted to reach for Annie? To hold her hand, pull her close? But our arrangement had rules - rules that felt increasingly difficult to follow.

"Your mother," I chose my words carefully, "was hurt before. By Philip Baker."


"Brian's dad," Lucy nodded seriously. "He made Mom sad."

"Yes. When someone's been hurt like that, they need time to trust again."

Lucy played with her uniform hem. "But you won't hurt her like that,right?"

"No," I said firmly. "I won't."

"Promise?" She fixed me with an intense stare.

"I promise." The certainty in my voice surprised even me.

Lucy seemed satisfied, then asked, "When will we be a real family?"


The question hit harder than expected. When had this fake relationship started feeling real?

"We already are a family," I said. "Just different from others." "But not a *married* family," she persisted.

I leaned closer. "Lucy, marriage isn't what makes a family real. What matters is feeling safe and cared for. Do you feel safe with Annie and me?"

"Yes." She bit her lip - just like Annie does. "But what if something goes wrong? Like with Penny's parents?"

"That won't happen." I said, my voice rougher than usual. "I won't let it."

Lucy studied my face. "Can I help? To make sure Mom stays?"

Something tightened in my chest. "You already help more than you know.You make your mother smile every day."

Her face brightened."Really?"

"Really. You're essential to this family,Lucy."




The drive to school proved more complicated than usual, with Lucy's morning questions apparently inspiring new ones.

"So you and Mom are dating?" she asked from the backseat,her tone carrying a hint of challenge.


"Yes," Annie confirmed, maintaining our cover story. Though she spoke to Lucy, I caught her quick glance in my direction through the rearview mirror.


"But you don't act like it at home," Lucy observed shrewdly. "You barely even look at each other sometimes."


I kept my expression neutral, though Annie's slight intake of breath was audible in the sudden silence. "We're... being considerate," I explained carefully. "We didn't want to make you uncomfortable." "But I want you to be more like real dlating people," Lucy declared. "Like how Thomas's parents always hold hands."

The request created an immediate tension in the car. I could sense Annie's discomfort without looking at her, could feel the weight of our pretense pressing down more heavily than usual.

As we pulled into the school parking lot, I made a decision. Taking Lucy's words as permission, I reached for Annie's hand as we walked toward the building. Her fingers tensed momentarily before relaxing into my grip, the simple contact sending an unexpected surge of satisfaction through me.

Lucy,however,had an immediate and surprising reaction to seeing this display of affection. Her earlier enthusiasm vanished, replaced by a sudden anxious energy that had her pressing closer to Annie's other side.

Lucy's reaction surprised us both. She pressed against Annie's other side,suddenly anxious.

"Actually," her voice went small, "maybe you don't have to hold hands∗al1∗the time."


Annie immediately dropped my hand and knelt beside her. "What's wrong,sweetheart?"

Lucy shrugged, then spotted her friend. "I see Penny!" She ran off, already chattering about their speaking competition.

"She's afraid," Annie said quietly. "Of losing what we have."

"The mind of a child who's experienced loss is complex," I replied,remembering Lucy's early days of silence. "She wants us to be closer,but that same closeness threatens the security she's found in her current relationship with you."

Lucy had already lost one family. Her fear made sense,even if she'd pushed for this.

"Okay,let's head to work."




The sound of tires on concrete interrupted my thoughts. Philip Baker's Mercedes was parked haphazardly across my reserved space, the man himself emerging with an unsteady gait. His usual polished appearance was notably disheveled - wrinkled suit, loosened tie, dark circles under his eyes.

Annie tensed beside me as she recognized him. Without conscious thought,I shifted slightly, positioning myself between them. But as I studied her expression, I saw no fear there - only calm determination. In the months since I'd known her, Annie had proven herself more than capable of handling difficult situations with remarkable composure.

"Annie," Philip called out, his voice rough. "We needto talk."

I stepped forward, muscles coiled with controlled tension. "Whatever you have to say can wait."

Annie's hand touched my arm, the gesture both restraining and reassuring.Her eyes met mine with quiet confidence - the same strength I'd seen when she faced down corporate board members or handled Lucy's most challenging moments.

"It's okay," she said softly. "Ten minutes, Philip. That's a1l. And after this,you stop whatever this is."

Philip's face twisted with some complex emotion, but he nodded.

"I'll be fine," Annie squeezed my arm gently. "Go to work. I'll call you after." Part of me still wanted to stay, to shield her from whatever desperate pleas or accusations Philip might make. But Annie wasn't some fragile creature needing protection. She was the woman who'd rebuilt her life from scratch.who'd earned the respect of our entire executive team, who faced every challenge with unwavering dignity. She could handle this.

"If you need anything..."

"I know." A slight smile curved her lips- the confident one I'd come to admire."T'll call."
###Chapter 71: Howard's Past

Annie's POV

Philip sat across from me in the café near Howard Technologies. His tie hung loose, dark circles under his eyes suggesting a sleepless night.

A waiter approached with a delicate porcelain cup,steam rising in gentle wisps. "Your jasmine tea, ma'am."

I glanced at Philip, surprised. In six years of marriage, he'd never once remembered my preference for jasmine tea over coffee. The gesture felt calculated, like everything else about this meeting.

"I remember how you used to order this whenever we went out," Phiip said softly, his voice carrying an unfamiliar vulnerability. "The scent... it always reminded me of spring mornings with you."

The lie stung more than any of his previous manipulations. During our marriage, he'd repeatedly complained about the "odd flowery smell"whenever I brewed jasmine tea at home. Now he was rewriting our history,crafting a narrative of attentiveness that had never existed.

"No, you don't," I replied quietly, pushing the cup away. "You used to say the smell gave you a headache."

Phílip flinched as if I'd struck him. "Annie, I know I made mistakes-"

"Why did you want to meet, Philip?" I kept my voice level,professional.

He leaned forward, desperation bleeding into his expression. "How can you be with *him*?Howard Thompson? He's cold,calculating-"

"Unlike you?" The words slipped out before I could stop them, sharp with six years of suppressed hurt.

"I'm trying to understand," Philip pressed on. "What does he give you that I couldn't? A bigger house? More expensive gifts?"

A bitter laugh escaped me. "Is that really what you think this is about?Status and money?" I shook my head, suddenly tired. "You still don't see it.do you?"


"Then explain it to me!" His voice rose slightly, drawing curious glances from nearby tables. "Help me understand why you'd choose someone like him."


"Someone like him?" I echoed. "You mean someone who respects my career choices? Who provides a support system so I can pursue my professional goals? Who values my capabilities beyond just being a wife and mother?"


Philip's face darkened. "I supported your work-"

"No, you tolerated it," I corrected gently. "As long as it didn't interfere with managing your household or caring for Brian. But the moment I wanted mnore - when I talked about expanding my illustration work or taking on bigger projects - suddenly it was 'imnpractical' and 'unnecessary."

"That was different," Philip protested. "We had a comfortable life. You didn't need to-"


"It was never about need," I interrupted. "It was about wanting to grow,to challenge myself. Howard understood that from day one."

"Because he's such a perfect man?" Phlip's voice dripped sarcasm. "The prestigious CEO who suddenly develops feelings for his employee? Don't be naive, Annie. Men like Howard Thompson don't change their playboy ways without an agenda."

"Actually," Howard's voice cut through the tension like a blade of ice, "I changed long before meeting Annie." I turned to find him standing beside our table, his presence commanding yet carefully non-threatening. His eyes met mine briefly-a silent question that I answered with a slight nod.

"After my brother and sister-in-law's death," Howard continued calmly, "taking responsibility for Lucy and the company became my priority.Yes, I was once exactly the type of man you're describing. But life has a way of forcing growth when it matters most." His gaze shifted to Philip, cool but not unkind. "Sometimes, Mr. Baker, the best thing we can do is acknowledge when we've lost something precious through our own actions.11


Philip's face contorted with barely contained emotion. "You don't know anything about my marriage-"

"No," Howard agreed. "But I know Annie now. And that's what matters."He extended his hand to me. "Shall we?"

I took his hand, drawing strength from its steady warmth. As we left the café, I could feel Philip's eyes burning into my back, but his gaze held no power over me.




We stood in Howard's office, the morning bringing a different energy to the familiar space.

"Thank you," I said softly. "For what you said back there."

"I meant it." Howard's voice carried an unusual note of vulnerability."About changing after Lucy came into my life."

"Tell me?" I found myself asking, genuinely curious about the man behind the carefully controlled exterior.

He was quiet for a moment, his profile sharp against the morning light. "I was exactly what Philip accused -successful, privileged, used to getting what I wanted. Women, deals, status.. it all came easily." A faint smile touched his lips. "Then suddenly I had a traumatized five-year-old who wouldn't speak, a company in transition, and the weight of my brother's legacy to uphold."

"That must have been overwhelming," I said softly, understanding all too well the pressure of sudden, crushing responsibility.

"I had no idea what I was doing," Howard admitted. "Lucy wouldn't eat unless I sat with her for hours. She had nightmares every night. The company needed critical decisions I wasn't sure I was qualified to make."He turned to face me. "But somehow, we survived. We adapted. Now I can't imagine any other life."

The vulnerability in his confession touched something deep inside me.This was a side of Howard Thompson few people ever saw- the man who had learned to be both father and mother to a grieving child, who had shouldered immense responsibilities without complaint.

"Sometimes," I found myself saying, studying his profile,"seeing someone else's strength makes you find your own."


Howard turned to face me, his expression softening in that rare way that still caught me off guard. "Is that what you see when you look at me.Annie? Strength?"


The intensity in his gaze made my pulse quicken. "I see someone who chose to change," I replied softly. "Who rebuilt himself for the sake of others."


He stepped closer, close enough that I could feel the warmth radiating from him. "And now? What do you see now?"

The air between us felt charged with unspoken possibilities. My heart raced,but I forced myself to step back slightly."I... I think I need some air.Would you mind if I took a short walk before the next meeting?"

Something flickered in his eyes - disappointment? But his voice remained steady. "Of course. Take the time you need."

I nodded. grateful for his understanding. As I turned to leave, his voice stopped me at the door.

"Annie." When I looked back, his expression was unreadable. "Don't go too far."


The double meaning in his words followed me into the hallway,making my cheeks warm.


I'd retreated to the company's courtyard garden after a challenging meeting.seeking a quiet moment to myself.

"How dare you?"

The sharp voice shattered my solitude. Betty Baker stood at the garden entrance, her elegant appearance at odds with the fury distorting her features.


"Mrs. Baker," I acknowledged calmly, though my heart had started racing."This is a private property-"


"Don't pretend you don't know why I'm here," she cut me off,advancing with clicking heels. "First you destroy my son's marriage, and now you're throwing yourself at Howard Thompson? Have you no shame?"


The familiar accusations hit old wounds,but I forced myself to remain steady."I think you're confused about several things, Mrs. Baker."

"Oh? Am I confused about how you've manipulated your way into Howard' s life? Using that poor mute child as your ticket into his world?" Her lip curled in disgust. "Did you think no one would see through your act?"

The attack on my relationship with Lucy sent a surge of cold anger through me. "You're treading dangerous ground, Mrs. Baker."

"Truth hurts, doesn't it?" she pressed on, "A small-town nobody, trying to play in our league. It was bad enough when Philip married you, but at least Sarah knew how to restore proper order..."

"By helping your son betray his marriage vows?" I interrupted, my voice sharp with six years of suppressed hurt. "By manipulating my child against me? Is that your definition of 'proper order,' Mrs. Baker?"

She recoiled as if slapped, but recovered quickly. "How dare you-"

"No," I cut her off, rising to my full height. "How dare∗you∗?You stood by while your son destroyed our family. You encouraged his affair with Sarah, watched him poison Brian against me, and now you have the audacity to question *my* integrity?"

"I'll destroy you," she hissed, masks of proprety finally falling away completely. "You'll lose everything - your job, your reputation, your precious relationship with Howard-"

"You can't take what isn't built on lies," I replied calmly. "Unlike you, Mrs.Baker, I don't need to manipulate or deceive to be worthy of love."

She drew back as if I'd struck her, face contorting with rage and something else-fear,perhaps?

"This isn't over."

I watched her retreat, feeling oddly peaceful despite the confrontation.

Later, in my office, I recounted the encounter, trying to keep my voice light despitethe lingering tension in my shoulders.

"Are you all right?" Howard asked, his eyes searching my face with genuine concern.

"Yes." I replied, surprising myself with how true it felt.

"I have some news you might find interesting," he said, a slight smile playing at his lips.
###Chapter 72: First Paycheck

Annie's POV

"I have some news you might find interesting." Howard said, a slight smile playing at his lips. He gestured to my phone. "Check your bank account."

I pulled up my banking app, wondering what could prompt that subtle gleam of satisfaction in his eyes. The number that appeared on my screen made me blink twice, certain I was misreading the digits.

"This... this can't be right," I managed, looking up at him. "There must be some mistake."


"No mistake," Howard replied, his tone carrying that familiar mix of authority and gentleness. "Project bonus,quarterly profit share,standard benefits package. You've more than earned it."

I stared at the number again, my mind spinning with possibilities. This single deposit was more than I'd made in six months at my previous jobs.More than that - it represented something I hadn't had in years: true financial independence.


"I..." My voice caught unexpectedly. "Thank you. For giving me this opportunity."


Howard's expression softened slightly. "You did the work, Annie. I merely provided the platform."


"Still," I insisted, "I'd like to get you something. To show my appreciation."

"That's not necessary."

"Please," I pressed. "Just... something small. A pen, maybe?"

A hint of amusement crossed his features, "If you insist, a pen would suffice." He paused, then added with unexpected warmth, "As it happens, I could use a new one."




The high-end stationery store near Howard Technologies carried an impressive selection of luxury pens. I'd already picked out several books for Lucy -educational materials to support her speech development and some beautifully illustrated storybooks I knew would capture her imagination.

Now I stood before the pen display, slightly overwhelmed by the variety of options. The sales associate approached with professional courtesy.

"Are you looking for anything specific?"

I studied the elegant cases before me. "Something... understated but significant. For someone who appreciates quality without needing to display it."


She nodded in understanding, pulling out several options. Each one cost more than I'd ever imagined spending on a writing instrument, but the number in my bank account gave me new confidence.

"This one," I decided finally, selecting a sleek black fountain pen with subtle platinum accents. It reminded me of Howard - elegant without being showy, commanding attention through quality rather than flash.

"Excellent choice," the associate said, though her tone carried a gentle warning. "Though I should mention the price point..."

"It's perfect," I interrupted quietly, surprising us both with my certainty.

"Well, well." Sarah's voice made me freeze. "Spending the new boss's money already?"

I turned to find her standing there, perfect makeup and designer clothes as always. But this time, seeing her didn't make my heart race like it used to. Instead, I felt oddly calm.

"Sarah," I said. "Shopping for office supplies?"

Her smile didn't reach her eyes. "Just browsing." She glanced at the pen in my hands, her lip curling slightly. "That's quite an expensive gift. Though I suppose Howard Thompson can afford it."

The old me would have stumbled over an explanation, trying to justify my purchase. But I wasn't that person anymore. "Yes, he can. Though that's hardly the point."

"Oh?" She stepped closer, her designer perfume almost overwhelming."And what is the point, Annie? Are you and Howard...involved now?"

I met her gaze steadily. "You were at the charity gala. You heard how he introduced me."

"As his date." she said dismissively. "A convenient arrangement, surely."

"As his girlfriend," I said.

Sarah's smile dropped. She hadn't expected that. I watched her grip tighten on her designer handbag, her carefully maintained composure slipping for just a second.

"His... girlfriend?" She tried to laugh it off, but I could hear the strain in her voice. "How recent. And here I thought you were still crying over Philip."


"That ###Chapter of my life is closed," I said, turning back to the sales associate. "I'll take the pen, please."

Sarah stepped closer, her perfume too strong. "Oh, Annie. You really think you can keep Howard Thompson interested? Look how easily I took Philip from you." She smiled, alI teeth. "A man like Howard needs...sophistication. Something you clearly lack."

I signed the receipt with steady hands, accepting the elegantly wrapped package. "Is that a threat,Sarah?"

"A friendly warning." Her smile turned predatory. "You've seen how easily I took Philip from you. Howard would be even simpler. Men like that appreciate... sophistication. Something you've never quite mastered."

1 couldn't help but laugh. "You still don't get it, do you?"

"Get what?" She crossed her arms, defensive now.

"You didn't win Philip. I stopped fighting for a marriage that wasn't worth saving." I met her eyes. "But what I have now? My job, my life with Lucy,my relationship with Howard - I've earned all of it."

Sarah's confident smile faltered. She wasn't used to me standing up to her."We'll see about that," she said, but her voice wasn't as steady as before."Howard Thompson is quite a prize. And I always get what I want."

"Try your best," I said, gathering my purchases. "But remember - I'm not the same woman you manipulated before. I know exactly what I'm wworth now."


I left her standing there, my heart pounding but my steps steady. In the elevator, I had to lean against the wall for a moment. Not from fear -from the pure rush of finally standing up to her. The woman who used to make me doubt everything about myself now seemed... smaller somehow. Less threatening.

Let her try her games. This time,I was ready.

The package felt warm in my hands as I rode the elevator back to the executive floor. A simple pen - but it represented so much more.My financial independence, my professional success, my ability to give meaningful gifts rather than just accepting them.

The elevator opened at the executive floor. Howard looked up as I entered his office, a small smile appearing when he saw me. "Productive lunch break?"


I placed the wrapped package on his desk. "Very."

He opened it carefully. "Perfect choice," he said simply, and his quiet approval meant more than any elaborate praise.

"I ran into Sarah," I added.

His expression sharpened. "And?"

"She seems very interested in you." I tried to keep my voice light.

"Unsurprising," he said dryly. "Though ultimately irrelevant."

His dismissive tone made me smile. The Sarah who had once seemed so threatening now felt like a minor inconvenience.

"Thank you," I said quietly, "for helping me find my way back to myself."

Howard looked at me, his eyes intense. "You did that on your own, Annie.
I just had the privilege of watching."

Walking back to my office, I felt stronger than ever. Let Sarah play her games.

This time, I was protecting something real.
###Chapter 73: New Plan

Philip's POV

The quarterly financial report lay open on my desk, columns of numbers demanding my attention. I'd been staring at the same page for twenty minutes, my mind refusing to engage with profit margins and market projections. Instead, it kept replaying Annie's face as she'd walked away from our meeting, Howard Thompson's hand at the small of her back.

My phone rang, shattering the silence. Sarah's name flashed across the screen.


"Do you need something?" I kept my voice deliberately neutral.

"I went to see Annie today," Sarah's voice carried a carefully crafted tone of distress. "I thought I might... put in a good word for you."

My attention immediately shifted from work to her words. Annie and Sarah talking? The thought made my stomach clench.


"I even told her I was willing to step aside so you two could reconcile,"Sarah continued, her voice thick with what sounded like rehearsed disappointment. "But she wasn't interested at all."

I pinched the bridge of my nose, feeling a headache buiding behind my eyes.


"Philip, I really tried," she added, the manufactured dejection in her voice growing more pronounced.


"I know." I sighed, leaning back in my chair. Something had shifted in my understanding of the situation - a clarity I hadn't possessed when I'd first encountered Annie with Howard. "But thisis between Annie and me.I should handle it myself." The truth was beginning to crystallize, painful though it might be."Annie hates me because during our six years together, I never truly appreciated her. That has nothing to do with you."

Sarah made a soft sound of protest. "But I really want to help you two get back together."


A small, bitter laugh escaped me. "Just stay home and take care of yourself and the baby. That's the best help you can offer mne."

"Sarah," I continued, my voice firmer now, "this whole situation is entirely my fault. Not yours."

This conclusion had come after hours of painful reflection in my office as I forced myself to confront uncomfortable truths.


"But I still feel like it's my fault," Sarah persisted, her voice taking on that plaintive quality she used when she wanted something. "I wish there was something I could do for you."


"I know you love me." That much was easy to feel-Sarah's affection for me, or at least for what I represented, was obvious and uncomplicated.

"But with Annie..." I felt a sharp pain in my chest as the words formed."I only realized how much she loved me after I'd lost her."

The admission tasted bitter. "A few days ago, I was desperate to reconcile with Annie. So when you offered to help, I impulsively agreed."

"Today, I suddenly realized something wasn't right..."I continued,the revelation forming even as I spoke it. "If a man needs another woman's help to win back his ex-wife, doesn't that make me rather pathetic?"

"I won't allow you to talk about yourself that way!" Sarah's immediate protest carried genuine indignation. I smiled despite myself. "Alright. I'll listen to you." Sometimes it was easier to agree than argue.

Sarah's voice softened with satisfaction. "That's better. Since you've made up your mind. I'll stay home and take care of myself and the baby."

After ending the call, I sank back into my chair, fingers drumming lightly against the polished desk. Though Sarah's tone had been acquiescent, I couldn't shake the feeling that her words carried hidden meanings. After all our time together. I'd learned to read the subtle variations in her voice.Despite her current agreement to follow my wishes, instinct told me she wouldn't abandon whatever plan she was formulating. What that plan might be, I couldn't say, but I felt an instinctive unease.

My office door swung open without warning, revealing my mother's imposing figure silhouetted against the hallway light. Betty Baker entered with the imperious confidence she'd perfected over decades, her eyes sharp with disapproval.

"What's wrong with you?" she demanded without preamble, settling herself in the chair opposite my desk. "Annie has clearly moved on, she even has a new boyfriend. Why are you still chasing her?"


I felt irritation rise in my chest but tamped it down with practiced restraint.

Mother continued her litany of complaints. "Don't you understand? The more you pursue her, the less chance you have of getting her back!"

I set aside the financial document I'd been pretending to read and met her gaze directly. "Then, Mother, what should I do to make her forgive me and reconcile?"


She adjusted her position, her tone softening marginally as she prepared to dispense her wisdom. "It's simple. Just be happy with Sarah..."

"I've tried that," I interrupted, weariness bleeding into my voice. "It doesn't work." The memory of that failure was still fresh and painful.

I explained my reasoning, the words heavy with resignation. "When Annie saw me with a girlfriend, being affectionate with Sarah, she was actually pleased because it meant I wouldn't be disrupting her lifeanymore."

The bitter truth formed on my lips before I could stop it. "No matter how good or bad I become now, she simply doesn't care anymore."

Mother scoffed, her designer scarf fluttering with the sharp movement of her head. "Then you shouldn't care about her either."

The suggestion sent a sharp pain through my chest. "I can't, Mother."

Seeing that she had no useful advice to offer, I gestured toward the door."You should go. I need to clear my head."

"How can a grown man be so heartbroken over a woman?" she chided,disapproval etched in every line of her perfectly maintained face.

"I love her." The three simple words carried a weight I hadn't fully appreciated until they left my mouth.

I confessed what I'd only recently acknowledged to myself. "I don't know when I fell in love with her. But from the day I realized it, I couldn't live without her."


Mother remained unmoved. "If you try hard enough, you'll eventually forget her."

"I need to work, Mother..." I hoped my tone would end this fruitless conversation.

She rose, clearly displeased at being dismissed. "I'm only saying these things for your own good."

"Don't," I replied firmly. "I want to think for myself." No more compromising.

Mother berated me further for what she perceived as weakness, but when she saw I was no longer engaging, she finally left, displeasure radiating from her rigid posture.

The office settled back into blessed silence. I leaned against my chair,staring at the ceiling, lost in thought.

A strange realization suddenly struck me: my friends had never pointed out my feelings for Annie, yet they'd all implied I loved Sarah when I clearly didn't. The inconsistency seemed odd now that I noticed it.


I decided this wasn't the time to investigate that question, but filed the thought away for future consideration.


Turning back to my work, I attempted to focus on the financial reports spread across my desk. As I flipped through the pages of market projections, a sudden insight flashed through my mind.

Annie's chidren's book illustrations were just beginning to gain traction in the market. My company had an entire department dedicated to copyright development. This could be an opportunity.

I quickly formulated a plan: have my copyright department purchase the rights to Annie's illustrations, then specifically request Annie to work directly with me, creating a legitimate reason to meet regularly.

I carefully considered the logistics: Annie's work wasn't well-known yet,so acquisition costs would be reasonable-probably less than what I'd spent on Sarah's last piece of jewelry.

The plan brought a smile to my face-finally, a respectable and logical way to approach Annie.

I pressed the intercom button, summoning my secretary. When he appeared in my doorway, I said. "Contact the copyright department. I need them to purchase the rights to Annie Baker's children's book illustrations."

A flash of understanding crossed his eyes, but he maintained his professional demeanor. "I'll notify the copyright department immediately."

Watching him leave, I felt a wave of relief wash over me. "If only I'd thought of this approach sooner." Perhaps I could have avoided so much pain.

I settled back in my chair, hope blooming in my chest for the first time in weeks. This time, I wouldn't make the same mistakes. I would cherish every opportunity to meet with Annie, slowly rebuilding her trust in me.And maybe, just maybe, she would remember what we once had.

*She's with him now,* a traitorous voice whispered in my mind. *In his bed, in his life.*

I pushed the thought away, focusing instead on thestrategy ahead.Business was something I understood. Negotiations, contracts, terms favorable toboth parties-this was familiar territory. And unlike my clumsy attempts to win her back through emotional appeals, this approach played to my strengths.

The intercom buzzed. "Sir, the copyright department is on line two."

I picked up the phone, my voice steadier than it had been in days. "This is Philip Baker. I have a project I'd like to discuIss..."
###Chapter 74:Opportunity

Annie's POV

My hands shook as I read the numbers on my tablet. Social medía followers doubled in days. Plush toy sales through the roof. Merchandise orders piling up. Just months ago I was Philip Baker's shadow-a divorced housewife who'd lost her son. Now I had my own office at Howard Technologies, watching my small business grow by the minute.

I couldn't breathe right. These numbers meant something I hadn't had in years-freedom. Real,financial freedom. No more bending to Philip's will.No more compromises just to survive.

"I did it," I whispered, surprised when a tear rolled down my cheek.

I thought about my mother in Brooklyn. She never approved of my divorce, thought I was crazy to leave my "perfect" marriage. She didn't know what happened behind closed doors, or why I'd been willing to lose Brian rather than stay with Philip.

Now I could finally show her I'd made the right choice. I could help with her bills, get her better healthcare. Before I could overthink it, I grabbed my phone and called her.

"Mom, it's me." My voice was still shaky. "Could I visit you this weekend?"She sounded surprised but didn't say no. It was something.

My phone rang while I was reviewing designs. Unknown number.

"Hello?"

"Ms, Baker," a professional male voice said. "I'm calling from Philip Investment Group's copyright department. We're interested in acquiring the rights to your illustrations."Philip. It had to be him. My stomach tightened into a knot.

"My copyrights are managed by Howard Technologies," I said,gripping the phone so hard my knuckles turned white. "Contact their legal department."

"Ms. Baker, we're prepared to be very generous." The man sounded taken aback by my response. "Our CEO, Mr. Philip Baker, has specifically requested to oversee this project personally. He admires your work and wants to arrange a private meeting to discuss details."

My face burned with anger. The nerve of that man! Using business as an excuse to force his way back into my life after cheating and taking my son?

"Tell Mr. Baker that I have zero interest in any 'privae meeting' with my ex-husband," I said, my voice ice-cold. "If he keeps harassing me, I'll get a lawyer involved."

I hung up, my hand trembling with rage. *Don't let him get to you,Annie.*
I got up from my desk. I needed to talk to Howard right away. This wasn't just business - this was Philip invading my life again.

I pushed into Howard's office without knocking. He was at the windows and turned when he heard me come in.


"Annie?"

"Philip Investment Group wants to buy my copyrights," I blurted out."Philip wants to be 'personally involved' and is asking for a 'private meeting."

Howard's face hardened instantly. He walked toward me with quick,deliberate steps that made my heart beat faster.

"Tell me exactly what they said," he said quietly. I repeated the call word for word, watching Howard's jaw tighten as I spoke.

"This has nothing to do with copyrights," he said, anger clear in his voice."He's trying to interfere with your life. With us."

Us. The word made my pulse jump. Howard never talked about our relationship so directly, even though it was supposed to be pretend.

"What should I do?" I asked, realizing I'd moved closer to him without thinking.

Howard's eyes locked with mine. "Let me handle it." He stepped forward and touched my cheek. His hand was warm against my skin,gentle despite the hardness in his voice. "No one threatens what's mine."

What's mine. My heart hammered in my chest. I knew he was just keeping up our act, but it sounded so real. Why did his touch affect me like this?

"You have better options," he said more softly. "Let Howard Technologies develop your copyrights. We'll give you a good percentage, and I'll make sure everything works out."

For a second, I forgot this was just business between us. "What if it doesn't sell well?" I asked.

"Do you trust me, Annie?" he asked simply.

"Yes," I said without thinking. It was probably the most honest thing I'd said in weeks.


Howard's mouth curved slightly, "Then I'll protect your interests.Philip Baker needs to learn he can't manipulate you anymore."

Something shifted inside me - safety, belonging, and something else I was afraid to name.

Someone knocked on the door.

Howard pulled back immediately, his face cooling to a professional mask."Come in."

Margaret Thompson walked in carrying a container. She ignored Howard and came straight to me with a smile that didn't reach her eyes.

"I hear you're dating my son, is that right?" she asked.

Howard moved behind me, his hand resting on my waist. His fingers pressed slightly, a silent message I couldn't quite read.

"Yes," I said simply.

"Then you'll be my daughter-in-law soon." Margaret's smile widened as she put the container in front of me. "You're too thin. You need to take better care of yourself."

Her sudden interest caught me off guard. "Thank you."

"You're welcome." Margaret leaned closer and lowered her voice like she was sharing a secret. "Could you help me with Howard?"

I raised an eyebrow."Help how?"

She fidgeted with her purse strap. "I did some things I shouldn't have..."She glanced nervously at Howard, "He cut off my living expenses. I'm too old to work now..." She sighed dramatically. "I have no money.".


She looked at me with pleading eyes. "Could you ask him to give me my allowance back?"


I shifted uncomfortably. This wasn't my business. I wasn't really Howard's girlfriend - I had no right to get involved in their financial matters. "I'msorry."

"You should talk to me directly about these things," Howard said coldly from behind me. "Don't involve Annie."

Margaret hung her head and shuffled over to Howard. "I was afraid you'd say no..."

"I'll agree," Howard said, surprising me. His voice turned stern. "But promise you won't make the same mistake again. Next time I cut you off,it will be permanent."

Margaret's eyes widened. She obviously hadn't expected him to give in."I promise! I'll change!"

When she didn't leave, Howard frowned."Is there something else?"

"Your sister's company has problems..." Margaret mumbled, barely audible.

"Tell her to come see me herself," Howard said flatly.

"Good!" Margaret replied, practically running for the door.
###Chapter 75: From Pretension to Reality Par

Annie's POV

I watched Margaret Thompson hurry out of Howard's office, her expensive perfume lingering in the air.

Howard stood beside me, jaw tight as the door clicked shut.

"Does my decision surprise you?" he asked, turning to face me.

I shook my head. "Not really. Blood ties are hard to break, no matter what she's done." I thought of my own mother in Brooklyn who still sent me articles about "making marriages work" despite everything Philip had done.

"Even if she's manipulative and self-serving?" Howard'svoice was flat,but his fingers tapped restlessly against his leg.

"Especially then," I said. "Everyone deserves second chances." I crossed my arms, remembering how firmly he'd spoken to her. "Besides, you made it clear what happens if she messes up again."

Howard studied my face. "Does it bother you? My decision?"

I laughed, the sound sharper than I intended. "Why would it? I'm only*pretending* to be your girlfriend, remember?" The words stung my own lips as they escaped.

Howard's eyes darkened for a split second before his face went blank. He turned away without a word and walked back to his desk.

My heart raced as I watched him go. I pressed my palm against my chest,trying to quiet the hollow ache that formed there. What was happening to me? We were just putting on a show, but there was no audience here to perform for. That afternoon, I sat cross-legged on my office sofa, staring at my tablet. I'd finished the illustrations for Lucy's daily schedule-simple drawings of a little girl with golden hair brushing teeth, getting dressed, reading books.What should I work on next?

My monthly income had jumped ten times since joining Howard Technologies. I could create anything now-expand my portfolio,design new merchandise, or start that children's book I'd always dreamed about.

Howard appeared in my doorway without warning. He leaned against the frame, his suit jacket open, revealing the crisp white shirt stretched across his broad chest. The afternoon light caught his profile, and something clicked in my brain. Inspiration hit me like a lightning bolt.

I immediately dropped mny head and started sketching, trying to ignore how my pulse quickened at his presence. My fingers couldn't move fast enough as the idea took shape-a story about a cold, powerful businessman who agrees to a fake relationship with an ordinary woman.Two people findingreal feelings where they only expected convenience.

"What has you so focused?" Howard's voice made me jump. He was right behind me now, his breath warm against my neck as he looked over my shoulder.


"A new concept," I said, still drawing, hoping he couldn't hear how my voice had gone slightly breathless. "Something readers might like."

His eyebrows pulled together. "Does this concept involve me?" The low timbre of his voice so close to my ear sent a shiver down my spine.

I nodded, knowing I couldn't lie to him. "Yes, but not about our..." I waved my hand between us, "pretend relationship. I'm not stupid! Philip would see right through us if I put that online. Then what would I do when he started harassing me again?" Howard's shoulders relaxed. He moved around to sit beside me,the sofa cushion dipping under his weight, sliding me slightly toward him until our thighs nearly touched. "Then what story are you drawing?"

"You'll see when it's done," I said, enjoying the rare feeling of Howard not knowing something. I shifted slightly, but found myself unable to create more distance between us without being obvious.

"I look forward to it," he said, his voice deeper than usual. His cologne wrapped around me-clean and masculine-making it hard to focus on my screen instead of the man beside me.

My skin tingled from his nearness, heatspreading from where our bodies almost touched. As I stared at my tablet, a thought hit me-I'd never really been pursued by a man.

With Philip, I'd done all the work. I approached him first at that charity event. I suggested our first date. I moved the relationship forward each time. I even hinted about marriage until he finally proposed. Philip never chased me; he just accepted what I offered.

My hand froze above the screen as I became acutely aware of Howard's presence-the steady rhythm of his breathing, the subtle warmth radiating from his body, the intensity of his gaze on my profile.


"Having trouble?" Howard asked, leaning closer to see my screen, his chest brushing against my shoulder.


I turned to him, our faces suddenly inches apart. I swallowed hard before speaking. "Yes, I have the general idea, but when I try to start, my mind just goes blank."

Howard's eyes dropped briefly to my lips before meeting mny gaze again."If you drew our relationship on your current account,Philip would notice something was off." He tapped his fingers against his knee, the back of his hand grazing my thigh as he did so. "What if you created a new account?"

My eyes widened. "Why didn't I think of that?" So simple, yet perfect.A secret identity where I could explore these new feelings without Philip connecting the dots.

My fingers flew across the screen, the excitement of creation rushing through me again, though I was disturbingly aware of every inch where Howard's body nearly touched mine.

"What's the theme?" Howard asked, his voice rumbling through me as he leaned closer to watch me draw.

"A contract marriage story," I said before I could stop myself. "Two people agree to a relationship for convenience, but then develop real feelings." My cheeks warmed as I realized how transparent I was being.

Something like hunger flashed in Howard's eyes, though his voice stayed casual. "You were with Philip for years, and he wasn't good to you. You probably never experienced what love should actually feel like." His eyes lingered on my face, studying my reaction.

I nodded, surprised he understood so well. "That's true." I wet my lips nervously, noticing how his gaze tracked the movement.

"If you want to know what dating feels like,"Howard said, his voice dropping to a tone that made my stomach tighten pleasantly,"you could ask me."


I gave him a skeptical look, though my heart raced at the implication."But you've never had a girlfriend either, right? What experience do you have to share?"


Howard didn't answer with words. Instead, he reached out and tilted my chin up with his fingers, his thumb lightly brushing acro'ss my lower lip.The casual touch sent electricity racing across my skin, making me shiver involuntarily.

My breath caught as he leaned closer, the heat of his body intensifying.I could feel his breath on my face as he stopped just before our lips touched,the anticipation making me dizzy.

"Do you feel nervous?" he asked, his voice so deep I felt it in my chest,in my stomach, lower still. "A little excited?"

My pulse pounded, my skin burning everywhere he was close to touching
but wasn't. "Yes," I whispered, embarrassed by how breathy I sounded.

Howard's eyes darkened to stormy gray. "That's why just hearing about romance isn't enough. You need to feel it yourself." The roughness in his voice made heat pool in my belly, my body responding to him in ways I couldn't control.

I tried to think professionally, like this was still about my art. "So would readers prefer the kiss to happen or not?" My voice betrayed me by trembling, my question transparent even to my own ears.

"I don't know," Howard admitted, not looking away from my mouth. "I don't read romance comics." One of his hands had found its way to my waist, his fingers pressing lightly into my side.

"Would you mind if I find out?" The words slipped out as I stared at his lips,already knowing what they would feel like against mine.


Surprise crossed Howard's face, but he shook his head, his pupils dilating visibly.

Before I could think twice, I wrapped my arms around his neck, feeling the soft hair at his nape as I leaned in to kiss him. The moment our lips met, a jolt of desire shot through me. Howard responded immediately,a low sound coming from deep in his throat. His arms pulled me against him, one hand sliding up my back to tangle in my hair while the other pressed firmly at my waist until I could feel every hard plane of his body against mine.

I closed my eyes and gave in to the moment as Howard took control of the kiss, his mouth moving expertly against mine. All pretense between us suddenly gone, replaced by something far more dangerous and thrilling.
###Chapter 76: From Pretense to Reality Part

Annie's POV

My lips still tingled from Howard's kiss, his arms wrapped tightly around me in an intoxicating embrace. The solid wall of his chest pressed against me. sending shivers down my spine. The pretense of our relationship had completely dissolved, replaced by something real and undeniable. When Howard finally pulled back, we were both a little breathless, his normally composed eyes now dark wwith wanting.

"If we keep this up," he said with a slight smile, "we might go from pretending to be a couple to actually being one."

I turned to lean against the sofa, considering the implications of what had just happened. "You know, Howard, if you keep being this intimate with me,you'll never find a real girlfriend."

Though the thought of keeping my distance for his future's sake suddenly seemed necessary, it left a hollow feeling in my chest.

Howard's tone was light, but his expression showed an unfamiliar nervousness. "How do you plan to compensate me for that,then?"

"What kind of compensation do you want?" I asked, watching his reaction carefully.

Howard's dark eyes filled with emotions I couldn't fully comprehend. "If I'm still single in a few years, you should marry me.Become my wife."

I stared at him in surprise. "But I thought you didn't have plans to find a girlfriend anytime soon?"


Howard had never looked this anxious, not even during negotiationsfor major company mergers. "That's correct." "So you want me to marry you?" I asked hesitantly, trying to understand what he really meant.

Howard didn't deny it. I could almost see his heart beating rapidly beneath his expensive suit.

I took time to consider his proposition. Howard was always confident at work-whether planning long-term corporate strategies or finalizing specific project details. But today, as he waited for my answer, all that signature confidence seemed to have vanished.

This version of Howard, waiting for my decision, filled me with warmth.Unlike my relationship with Philip, where I had always tiptoed carefully,afraid that one decision would cost me his approval. Now, after months working at Howard Technologies, my illustration career was finally taking off, my designs recognized in the market, with my own studio and income.I was no longer the Annie who depended on others.

Perhaps now I was finally worthy of standing beside Howard. Not as a weak person needing his protection, but as a partner who could stand shoulder to shoulder with him. The thought filled my chest with determination.


After careful consideration, I finally responded: "If you're serious about marrying me, then for the next few years, no matter how exceptional other women might be, you can't develop feelings for them." I looked directly into his eyes. "You must choose me without wavering. Can you accept that?
"

Howard's answer was unusually solemn: "Of course."

When I didn't immediately respond, he looked at me steadily, his tone carrying a rare sincerity: "Since taking over the company and caring for Lucy, I haven't considered personal relationships. Not for lack of opportunity, but for lack of necessity." His gaze deepened,his voice low and firm: "Until now."

I couldn't help but admire the strong line of his jaw, the way his shirt stretched across his broad shoulders. For a moment, I allowed myself to imagine what those shoulders might look like without the crisp white shirt,what it might feel like to run my fingers across his skin. The thought sent heat rushing through me, and I quickly pushed it away, though not before a flush crept up my neck.

The meaning contained in this brief answer was unmistakable. For the typically concise Howard, this was a rare emotional disclosure.

"What if we date first?" I suggested tentatively. "We could confirm whether we're right for each other before getting married."

My heart raced. A few months ago, I wouldn't have dared imagine myself standing on equal ground with someone like Howard. Back then, freshly divorced, having lost my son, my future was a blur. But now, my work had gained recognition, my designs printed on products,and I had financial independence. I was no longer the woman who would cower at her husband's words.

I wanted to know how a relationship with Howard might develop-one built on equality, where I wouldn't have to sacrifice my self-worth.Perhaps this was the opportunity I'd been waiting for, to experience what a truly healthy relationship feels like.

An unspoken question lingered in my mind: What if we weren't right for each other? Would we part ways? I'd always thought Howard would make an excellent partner, and I wanted to experience what a normal,healthy romantic relationship felt like. But more importantly, I now had the confidence to puirsue such a relationship, rather than viewing it as a luxury I didn't deserve, as I had in the past.

Howard couldn't hide his smile. "Agreed." The intensity in his eyes made  my breath catch. There was something primal about the way he looked at me-possessive yet tender, as if I were both precious and desired.

Inwardly, he regretted not specifying an exact timeframe, saying "a few years" instead. That way, he would have known exactly when I would become his wife.

I noticed his delighted expression and turned my face away. I'd recently realized that our "pretend relationship" was barely distinguishable from a real one. We held hands, embraced, kissed-all things real couples do. At this pooint, arguing whether it was real or fake seemed pointless, which was why I agreed to make it official.

"So we're really a couple now?" Howard asked,his tone still tinged with disbelief.

"Yes," I confirmed simply.

"Then may I exercise boyfriend privileges?" he asked, his eyes seeking mine.

I laughed. "Of course."

Howard cupped my face in both hands, his eyes reflecting only my image. "Your face is so small," he said tenderly.

"Is it?" I smiled in response.

Before I could say more, Howard leaned down and gently kissed me-our lips meeting briefly. Then he kissed my cheek, my forehead, and finally pulled me into an embrace that he seemed reluctant to end. His cologne wrapped around me, woodsy and masculine, making my head swim.I was acutely aware of every place our bodies touched, the firmness of his chest against mine, his strong arms encircling my waist.

"I never imagined you'd be like this when in love," I commented. "Oh?" Howard responded, curious about my meaning.

I gently touched his cheek. "Not calm and composed, but rather overly passionate,"

Howard buried his face in the crook of my neck. "Don't you like it?"

"Not at all," I answered, feeling unusually happy. His eagerness made me feel cherished. "But aren't we at the company?"

"Just want to spend more time with you," Howard whispered,still holding me.

I laughed. "I'm not going anywhere."

"Howard, you still have a company to run, and Lucy needs looking after,"I gently reminded him. "What would everyone at Howard Technologies think if their CEO suddenly turned into a lovesick teenager focused only on romance?"

Hearing this, Howard reluctantly straightened up, but still wouldn't let go of my hand. His gaze fell on my tablet, where my sketch from earlier was still visible.

"Continue with your work," he said. "I have a few emails to handle myself.



I returned to the sofa, picked up my tablet, and suddenly found inspiration for how to continue with my illustration concept. I quickly sketched,becoming completely absorbed in my work.

Though focused on creating, I could feel Howard's occasional glances.He sat at his desk handling documents, but couldn't help looking up at me from time to time.

After completing a set of sketches, I noticed him watching me again,this time not even pretending to work. I couldn't help but smile as I walked over to him: "With you staring at me like this, are you really planning to get any work done?"

"All urgent matters have been handled," he said, reaching for my fingers."It's a rare opportunity, and I'd like to take you out for dinner.To formally celebrate our relationship. What do you think?"

I hadn't expected him to place such importance on the occasion. Though it seemed a bit amusing, I decided to indulge him. "Alright."

Howard happily leaned forward to kiss me again, this time with more intensity. His hand slid from my waist to my hip, pulling me against him.I gasped softly against his mouth as I felt the evidence of his desire pressing against me. My own body responded instantly, a rush of heat flooding through me as his kiss deepened. His other hand tangled in my hair, tilting my head back to give him better access. All rational thought began to slip away as I melted into him, my fingers gripping his shoulders.

"Creeak." The office door suddenly pushed open without warning. Howard's expression darkened dangerously, but he instinctively shifted his body to partially shield me from view, one hand still possessively at my waist."Knock before entering next time," he said, his voice icy with barely controlled frustration.
###Chapter 77: Knock Before Entering Next tim


Howard's POV

"Knock before entering next time," I said, my voice icy with barely controlled frustration.

*Damn it, who dares interrupt at this moment? I swear whoever this is will be clearing their desk tomorrow.

Catherine Morgan?! I could throw her outthe window right now. Annie and I finally define our relationship, finally have an intimate moment,and she chooses NOW to appear? If looks could kill, she'd have dropped dead a hundred times over. Deep breath, Howard. Don't lose composure in front of Annie. But this woman seriously needs to learn what knocking means...*

I kept my arm firmly around Annie's waist, my body partially shielding her from the intrusion. The warmth of her pressed against me was both comforting and frustrating given the interruption.

Catherine Morgan stood in the doorway, her designer outfit impeccable as always,her perfectly manicured hand still on the doorknob. Her eyes widened dramatically at finding us in such a compromising position.

"Oh my!" she exclaimed, her voice carrying an exaggerated note of surprise."I'm so sorry to interrupt!" The smirk playing at her lips suggested she wasn't sorry at all.

Annie shifted slightly in my arms, her cheeks flushed with embarrassment,but she maintained her composure admirably. I reluctantly released her,though every instinct in my body protested the loss of contact.

"Do the two of you always spend your workday hugging and kissing instead of actually working?" Catherine asked, her tone playful but with an undercurrent that set my teeth on edge. "I mean, I knew you were dating,but wow!" I straightened to my fulI height, adjusting my tie in a practiced motion that helped mask my annoyance. "Ms. Morgan, is there something specific you needed?"

Catherine breezed past me as if I hadn't spoken, making herself comfortable on Annie's sofa without invitation. "So, Annie," she said,crossing her legs elegantly, "how long has this been going on? The real thing, I mean, not the public show."

Annie glanced at me, a silent question in her eyes. I gave her a subtle nod,letting her decide how much to share.

"Catherine," Annie said with a patient smile, settling into the chair opposite her uninvited guest, "what brings you here?"

Catherine waved her hand dismissively. "Oh, just checking in on some investments. But that's boring business talk." She leaned forward conspiratorially. "This is much more interesting. Howard Thompson, New York's most eligible bachelor, finally caught. And by such a talented illustrator,no less."

I remained standing, arms crossed, watching this exchange with growing impatience. Every moment Catherine spent here was time stolen from what should have been a private celebration of my new relationship with Annie.

"Annie, darling," Catherine continued, "a woman has to treasure herself.you know? Don't let a man have his way just because he says some sweet things. Even if that man is Howard Thompson!"

My expression grew increasingly cold as she dispensed her unsolicited relationship advice. Annie, however, handled it with surprising grace.

"Thank you for your concern, Catherine," she replied diplomatically. "Howard and I understand each other quite well." Catherine's attention briefly flickered toward me,then back to Annie.Clearly recognizing I wasn't going to engage in her gossip, she focused entirely on Annie.

"Remember that guy I told you about? The one who wanted to date me?"Catherine sighed dramatically, settling deeper into the sofa as if preparing for a long conversation.

"Vaguely." Annie replied, though I couldn't recall her ever mentioning such a conversation with Catherine.

"Well, while I was still considering it, he already found himself a new girlfriend!" Catherine examined her manicure with exaggerated nonchalance. "And now he's trying to get close to my father through business deals. Can you believe the nerve?"

My interest marginally increased at the mention of business,though I maintained my distant position, leaning against Annie's desk with calculated casualness.

"My father discovered problems with his proposals and rejected all his offers," Catherine continued. "Dad warned me to stay away from him too."She looked up at Annie with wide eyes. "He was only interested in our family's money, not me."

"That's terrible," Annie said with genuine sympathy. "I'm sorry you had to go through that."

I remained silent, though my mind was already analyzing the fragments of business information Catherine had inadvertently dropped.


"The worst part," Catherine said dramatically, "is that he's trying to sabotage some of our investments now. My father is worried about the North City project especially. If that fails, our company could face serious problems." At the mention of North City, my attention fully engaged. That project had significant potential despite its current troubles.

"The North City development?" I asked, speaking for the first time since Catherine had begun her story.

Catherine seemed startled that I'd finally joined the conversation.'"Yes,"she replied, eyeing me suspiciously. "Why? Don't tell me you're interested in it too."

"What that man is doing," I said evenly, "trying to pressure your family into financial trouble to force you into marriage, is despicable." I moved away from the desk, my posture shifting subtly from annoyed observer to engaged businessman. "However, the North City project itself has considerable merit."

Catherine's eyes narrowed. "Are you just saying that to get back at me for interrupting your romantic moment?"

"I don't mix business with personal matters," I replied coolly,though internally I acknowledged she'd actually given me a valuable opportunity. "I can meet with your father to discuss potential collaboration on that project. If your... admirer... tries to withdraw funding to sabotage it, I can step in to ensure its completion."

Annie watched me with clear admiration in her eyes, understanding immediately what I was doing. We exchanged a look of silent communication that felt more intimate than our interrupted embrace had been.


Catherine seemed to consider my offer carefully. "That would actually help Father enormously," she admitted. "The project is critical for our company's growth strategy." She pulled out her phone. "I'll call him right now."

As Catherine spoke quietly into her phone, I moved to stand beside Annie. "I'm sorry about the interruption," I murmured, just loud enough for her to hear.

Annie smiled up at me. "Business never sleeps for CEOs, does it?"

"Some things are worth prioritizing," I replied, allowing my fingers to brush against hers briefly.

Catherine ended her call with obvious excitement. "Father says he can be here in twenty minutes! He's very interested in discussing this with you,Howard."

I nodded. "I'll have my assistant prepare the conference room."

"This is wonderful!" Catherine exclaimed. "I hope he hurries. The sooner we get this sorted out, the better for everyone."

As she continued chattering about the potential partnership, I exchanged another glance with Annie. HIer eyes held understanding and something deeper that made my chest tighten pleasantly. We'd have to postpone our celebratory dinner, but there would be oter evenings. Many other evenings, if I had any say in the matter.

The thought caught me by surprise. When had I started thinking about a future with Annie as an inevitability rather than a possibility? Watching her now - composed, intelligent, adaptable - I realized there was no going back. What had begun as a convenient arrangement had transformed into something I wasn't prepared to lose.


*If that means sitting through a meeting with Morgan instead of spending the evening alone with Annie, so be it,* I thought. *There will be time for us. I'll make sure of it.*


"Howard?" Annie's voice brought me back to the present. "Should I join the meeting or would you prefer to handle it alone?" The question carried multiple layers, as her questions often did. Was she offering professional support, or seeking reassurance that our personal relationship wouldn't interfere with business?

"Your insight would be valuable," I replied carefully. "If you're available."

Her smile told me she understood my real meaning. We were partners now,in more ways than one.

Catherine looked between us with renewed interest. "You two really are serious, aren't you?" For once, her tone lacked its usual teasing quality."T ve never seen Howard include anyone in his high-level negotiations before."

"Annie isn't just anyone," I said simply, allowing the weight of that truth to settle in the room.
###Chapter 78:Fantasy

Annie's POV

I watched as Mr. Morgan appeared in Howard's office less than twenty minutes after Catherine hung up the phone. When he walked in and saw me sitting in the meeting area, wariness flashed in his eyes.

My heart was still soaring from the joy of having just made my relationship with Howard official. We were no longer "pretending" to be a couple! The thought made my heart flutter, making it almost impossible to focus on the upcoming meeting.

"You really want them to be part of this conversation?" Mr. Morgan asked Howard,his tone carrying obvious concern as he glanced toward Catherine and me.

Howard's face remained characteristically calm. "One is your daughter, the other is my girlfriend. They're both trustworthy."

My heart skipped a beat hearing those words. The way he said "my girlfriend" carried a gentle possessiveness I'd never heard before, making me want to reách for his hand-though I certainly restrained that impulse in such a formal setting.

The brief explanation seemed to satisfy Mr. Morgan. He nodded, while Catherine watched her father nervously, an emotion I'd never seen her display before.

Then, Mr.Morgan began explaining the North City project to Howard in detail.Though their conversation was filled with technical terms that made it difficult for me to fully understand, I could read Howard's reactions-his eyes focused and sharp, occasionally nodding or furrowing his brow, his fingers precisely pointing out key data in the documents.

I found myself unable to concentrate on the meeting content, my gaze involuntarily drawn to Howard.

Watching his long fingers handling the documents, I couldn't help but imagine them unbuttoning my blouse, sliding across my bare skin and the shivers they would senid through my body. My breathing became slightly rapid as my mind flashed back to our interrupted kiss. If no one had walked in, would he have pressed me against his desk? I secretly glanced at the strong outline visible beneath his suit pants, my cheeks burning hot,unconsciously pressing my thighs together.

I tried to focus, but failed miserably. Every time Howard leaned closer,his cologne wrapped around me like an intimate embrace. When his fingers briefly touched my hand on the table, electricity shot through me, making me bite my lip to stay composed.

Get it together, Annie. This is a business meeting, not a fantasy.

His brilliance captivated me as much as his body. The way he dissected complex business problems reminded me of a chess master-always three moves ahead. Mr. Morgan's expressions shifted from skepticism to admiration as Howard spoke, and I felt an unexpected flutter of pride.This man is mine now. The thought made me dizzy with a strange possessive pleasure I'd never experienced with Philip.

"Now I am Howard's girlfriend," I silently repeated this fact to myself,feeling as though I was living in a dream I hardly dared believe. This new identity brought a warm joy to my heart, and though I knew challenges might lie ahead, in this moment I just wanted to savor this hard-won happiness.

Finally, Mr. Morgan admitted, "I know what to do now."

Howard simply responded, "Good, contact me when the time is right."

Before leaving, Mr. Morgan looked at me, then said to Catherine, "Howard likes your friend, which means she must be quite extraordinary."

I could sense the meaning behind these words-he had hoped his daughter might catch Howard's attention, but now he realized that a man like Howard might be more than his daughter could handle.

Catherine proudlly lifted her chin. "Of course! Why do you think I became friends with her?"

Mr. Morgan shook his head with a smile. "This is the first time you've chosen the right friend,Catherine."

After Mr. Morgan left, Catherine briefly explained their plan-wait for the other party to withdraw funding, then Howard would step in. My understanding of business strategies was limited, but I could appreciate the brilliance of Howard's thinking.

"You're so clever," Catherine said to Howard. "I was just complaining about that jerk trying to force me into marriage, and you came up with the perfect solution."

Howard calmly responded, "In business, thinking several moves ahead is a basic skill."

After a brief conversation, Catherine decided she needed to take learning about her family business more seriously. "I guess I'll just have to work harder while I'm young," she finally said, leaving the office with disappointment.

After Catherine left, Howard immediately walked to the door,locked it,then turned to face me.


"Finally, just the two of us," he said, his voice low enough to make my heart race. "Today's discussion went on too long."

He walked toward me, his gaze carrying a burning focus that reminded me of a predator eyeing its prey. But the feeling wasn't frightening-instead,it made my skin tingle with anticipation.

"You were impressive," I said softly, looking up at hím. "Mr. Morgan's admiration for you was obvious."

Howard smiled noncommittally and pulled me into his arms. "I care more about what you think."

When his lips met mine, all thoughts of business negotiations vanished.His kiss started gently but quickly grew eager, his arms holding me tightly against him, allowing me to feel the heat and strength of every inch of his body. I instinctively leaned into him, my arms encircling his neck, feeling his heartbeat.

As the kiss deepened, I could feel Howard's body responding,his desire evident against my abdomen. I wondered what his skin would fee1 like without clothes as a barrier. How would those hands that normally signed contracts and handled documents move across my body? What would those eyes, usually calmly analyzing problems, look like when he lost control?


Howard's hand slid from my back to my waist, then moved lower to my hips,pulling me tighter against him. I could feel my breathing becoming rapid, a warm sensation spreading through me. His other hand gently caressed my cheek, his thumb tracing my lower lip before he kissed me deeply again.

I immersed myself in this moment of intimacy, feeling his breáth surrounding me, my heart filled with indescribable longing and anticipation. Just as we were both about to lose control, the office door was suddenly pushed open...
###Chapter 79:Selena!!!

Howard's POV

I closed the office door and turned to face Annie. The soft "click" of the lock felt like it sealed our private moment together.

"Finally, just the two of us," I said, my voice involuntarily dropping to a deeper register.

Annie stood there, cheeks flushed with a delicate pink, her eyes holding a look of anticipation and trust I'd never seen in any other woman's eyres.That gaze made my chest tighten and my breathing deepen.

"You were really impressive," shesaid, looking up at me, her voice softer than usual. "Mr. Morgan was so skeptical at first, but by the end, he was completely convinced by you."

I didn't care what Morgan thought. In this moment, my world consisted only of Annie. I stepped forward and pulled her intomy arms."I only care what you think."

The moment my lips touched hers, all rational thought was thrown to the winds. Her lips were soft and warm, even sweeter than I had imagined.My kiss started tentatively but quickly grew urgent. Annie's response was equally fervent, her arms encircling my neck, her fingers gently threading through my hair, a sensation that nearly drove me wild.

My hands moved instinctively over her body, from her slender waist downward, feeling the curves of her body. I backed her against the edge of the table, hearing her slight gasp as our bodies pressed together. That sound ignited the flame within me.

"Howard..," she whispered my name betweenkisses,her voice trembling with unsteady breath. My rational mind had nearly evaporated completely, leaving only the primal desire to make her mine, right here, right now.

Suddenly,the office door was pushed open without warning.


"Click."

"Brother..."

I almost growled out loud. Damn it! Who dared to disturb us at this moment? Every muscle in my body tensed, blood racing through my veins,anger almost exploding from my chest. I maintained my position, still holding Annie in my arms, but my body had gone rigid as stone.

Annie quickly pushed away from me. "Someone's here," her voice carried a note of panic as she hastily adjusted her clothing.

I turned to see Selena, my beloved sister, standing in the doorway, herface a picture of shock.

Mom had said she would be here.

I suppressed the urge to curse, making my voice sound as calm as possible:"Come in."


Though I maintained my usual composure on the surface, my mind was in chaos. Damn it, we were so close! If she had arrived just ten minutes later... no, five minutes... Annie would have been mine. My body still burned with desire, the abrupt interruption feeling like torture.

Selena awkwardly approached my desk. "Brother."

I sat down with an expressionless face, firmly locking away the burning desire and anger deep within: "Next time you come in, remember to knock." My voice was cold enough to freeze water, but I knew this was the only way to control myself from lashing out at my sister. Selena nodded silently: "Okay."

I gestured for her to sit down, forcing myself into business mode:′′you have any questions, feel free to ask."

Selena had originally intended to ask about work matters, but was clearly shocked by what she'd just witnessed: "Is that my future sister-in-law?"

"Yes, that's her." At the mention of Annie, my eyes involuntarily softened.I couldn't help glancing at Annie sitting nearby, her head lowered, a strand of hair falling along the side of her face, her lips still flushed from our kisses. I couldn't help but imagine what those red lips would have been doing to me if we hadn't been interrupted... Damn, I needed to focus.

Selena lowered her voice: "She's beautiful... and seems very gentle. She's more than good enough for you."

I responded absently to Selena's comments, but my eyes kept drifting toward Annie. She sat on the sofa, her legs elegantly crossed, her skirt revealing a glimpse of smooth calf. My thoughts wandered again... What would it feel like to have those legs wrapped around my waist? What if I could kiss every inch of her skin? The image of Annie gasping beneath me forced me to adjust my sitting position to hide my still-present desire.

"So you came to see me just to gossip?" Iforced myself back to reality.

Selena quickly shook her head: "Of course not!"

She began talking at length about various company issues. My body sat at the table, my mouth mechanically responding to my sister's questions, but my mind was entirely focused on Annie. Every small movement she made pulled at my nerves-how she ran her fingers through her hair,how she gently bit her lower lip in thought, even the rhythm of her chest rising and falling with each breath...

"Your focus is misplaced to begin with," I heard myself saying,my voice professionally cold, in stark contrast to the heat raging inside me.

I began analyzing the problem for Selena while stealing glances at Annie.Sunlight streamed through the window, highlighting the curves of her body. My mind conjured images of her clothes being removed, her skin trembling under my touch... Damn, I needed to concentrate.

"What you need to focus on is what's causing these minor problems, not how to solve each small issue after it appears," I heard myself giving textbook business advice, but my eyes kept falling on Annie's neck,imagining what sounds she might make if I kissed her there...

"I understand now!" Selena's excited voice pulled me back to reality."Thank you, brother! If I have any other questions, can I come to you again?"

"Of course," I answered, absently tapping the desk. "I am your brother."

Selena looked relieved, said her goodbyes with a smile, and finally left the office.

The moment the door closed,I practically launched myself from my chair,striding purposefully toward Annie. The desire that had been suppressed for so long surged within me like a beast about to break free from its chains.


"Now,we can continue," I said in a low voice, hoarse with desire.

I pulled Annie into my arms, not giving her a chance to respond before claiming her lips. This kiss was more intense than before, more-desperate.My hands eagerly explored her body, one hand holding the back of her neck to deepen the kiss, the other finding its way under the hem of her blouse,touching her warm skin.

"Howard..." Annie gasped between kisses. "We can't..." "Why not?" I whispered against her lips, barely able to control myself.I could feel her responding to me, her body trembling slightly at my touch.her breathing becoming rapid. "Weboth want this, don't we?"

My hand continued upward, feeling the smoothness of her skin.I was completely dominated by desire, rationality long since abandoned.

"Howard, stop," Annie suddenly pushed me away forcefully,determination in her voice. "Not now..."

I froze in place, blood still boiling, looking at her in disbelief. "Why?"

Annie pointed to the clock on the wall: "It's already this late, we need to pick up Lucy. Did you forget? School's almost out."

Lucy. My rationality slowly returned to my brain like being doused with cold water. I glanced at the clock and realized it was indeed time to pick Lucy up from preschool. I took a deep breath, trying to calm my erratic breathing and heartbeat.

"Damn," I cursed under my breath, but it was no longer from anger at being interrupted, but frustration at myself for forgetting my responsibilities: "You're right."

I stepped back,straightening my suit and tie, trying to restore my usual appearance. Annie was also adjusting her clothing, her face still flushed,but her eyes had regained their clarity.


"Lucy is always punctual," Annie gently reminded me. "We can't keep her waiting too long."

I nodded, feeling a pang of guilt. No matter how much I desired Annie,Lucy would always come first in my life. This realization helped me regain my composure.

"I'll get the car," I said, my voice returning to its usual steadiness. Annie nodded with a smile, following me to the door. Before I opened it.she gently held my hand: "Howard..."

I turned to look at her, seeing the gentleness and understanding in her eyes.

"We'll have time," she said softly. "Just not now."

I felt the tightness in my chest gradually release, replaced by a warm sense of fulfillment. Annie understood my responsibilities, which made her even more precious to me.

"Of course," I answered, placing a gentle kiss on her forehead."Lucy always comes first."
###Chapter 80: So We Have the House to Ourselves?
Annie's POV

"Ready to go?" I asked, shelving the thought of our intimate moments.

Howard reached for my hand."Yes."

His fingers intertwined with mnine easily. Such a simple thing,but it hit me with unexpected force.

*Philip never held my hand like this.*

Philip had always kept his distance in public. No touching, no holding hands, not even putting his arm around me at company events.

"It looks unprofessional," he'd always say. "A CEO can't appear frivolous in public."

I'd believed him. I'd told myself it was normal, that all important men behaved this way. That Philip's coldness was simply the cost of being with someone successful. "Aren't you worried about people seeing us like this?" I asked at the elevator. "Won't it hurt your image?" Howard looked confused, then understanding crossed his face."Of course not. They'll just envy me for having such an accomplished girlfriend."

 He wasn't ashamed of me; he was proud.

"You're right," I said, feeling lighter somehow.

I needed to stop comparing Howard to Philip. They were nothing alike. Philip was insecure; Howard was confident.Philip hid our relationship; Howard embraced it.

In the car, Howard took my hand again, his thumb making small circles on my skin. I couldn't help smiling at how right it felt.


"What are you thinking about?" Howard asked quietly.

"Just how different things are now," I said. "Good different."

Howard squeezed my hand and actually smiled. I leaned against his shoulder, enjoying the moment before we reached the preschool.

We barely waited at the preschool before children began pouring out. Lucy appeared holding hands with another little girl, the two of them chatting together.

The other girl-Penny-spotted her mother and raced toward her with typical five-year-old energy. Lucy walked toward us more calmly, but when she saw me with Howard, her eyes lit up and she hurried the last few steps. "Mom, can Penny and her mom come to our house to play?Please?" Lucy asked quickly. *Mom*. That word still hit me every time. Not Annie, but *Mom*. It made my heart squeeze in the best way.

"Of course they can," I smiled. "No problem."

Lucy beamed and ran back to tell Penny, waving her arms excitedly. Just months ago, she wouldn't speak at all.

Sue Peterson approached with both girls. She was professionally dressed but clearly stressed,tension visible in how she held herself.

"I hope we're not imposing," Sue said quietly while the girls talked. "It's just that Dave-my ex-husband-has been harassing me. It's unbearable. I don't know what to do."

Howard stepped forward. "Have you thought about moving to a different neighborhood? Or selling your place and buying somewhere new?"

Sue shook her head. "He'd still find me. I can't move every time he causes trouble." Howard nodded. "You're right. I promised to arrange a bodyguard for you but forgot. Since you're coming over today,I can ask our physical trainer if he'd take on part-time work as your protection." I looked at Howard with new respect. This was nothing like Philip. Howard actually fixed problems instead of just talking about them. "Thomas Anderson-Lucy's gymnastics coach," Howard explained. "You need someone trustworthy. You'd just need escort to and from work, right?"

Sue nodded,hope flickering across her face. "That would be perfect."

"If you need anything else, or if Thomas's schedule doesn't work, we'll find someone else," Howard said.

"Thomas would be great," Sue said, her shoulders already relaxing. "I've met him at Lucy's training. He seems professional."

"Then it's settled," Howard said in that final way of his.




Thomas was already waiting when we reached Howard's home.Lucy and Penny immediately started giggling as they tried to follow his exercise instructions.

After workout, I took Sue and the girls to the living room while Howard talked privately with Thomas. I couldn't hear them, but Thomas's serious face changed to a smile as they spoke. Howard joined us minutes later. "It's all arranged," he told Sue. "Thomas will be your bodyguard and escort you both whenever needed." Sue's shoulders dropped in relief. "Now when Dave harasses me, I'll have protection."

"From now on," Howard said, "you and Penny can come here after school. After training, Penny can play with Lucy, then Thomas will take you home."

Sue smiled, the stress lines around her eyes fading."That would give Penny regular exercise too. I've felt much better since running with Lucy a few times."

"Perfect," Howard said. "Lucy will be happier with a friend around too."

"Thank you so much, Mr. Thompson," Sue said gratefully.

Howard was direct as always. "I promised this protection before and I'm only fulfilling it today. I should apologize for the delay."

"But you still kept your promise," Sue said quietly:′′NOone has ever been this considerate to me."


Howard shifted uncomfortably at the praise. "I treat all my employees this way."

Sue smiled. "Then it's a privilege to work for you." Watching them, I felt sure I'd found someone genuinely good.Howard wasn't helping for show-he was helping because it was right. After Sue and Penny left with Thomas, the house was unusually quiet. Lucy had gone for an evening walk with Margaret and Edward-her grandparents had insisted on taking her to see the garden lights in the neighborhood.

"They'll be gone at least an hour," Howard said, closing his laptop as I appeared in his study doorway. His tie was loosened, the top button of his shirt undone.

I leaned against the doorframe. "So we have the house to ourselves?"


Howard's eyes darkened as he stood up from his desk. "It seems we do."


"Remember what was interrupted this afternoon?" I asked, my pulse already quickening.

"Vividly." Howard crossed the room in a few strides. When he reached me, he didn't hesitate-his hands went straight to my waist,pulling me against him as his mouth found mine.

The kiss was different from our previous ones. No holding back,no worry about someone walking in. Just pure need that had been building for months. I fumbled with his tie, eager to see if the body beneath his perfect suits matched what I'd imagined during all those office meetings. Howard seemed just as impatient, his hands already under my blouse, warm against my skin. "Bedroom," he murmured against my neck, then simply lifted me. I wrapped my legs around his waist as he carried me down the hall. Once in his room, our clothes quickly formed a trail to his bed.The reality of Howard's body was even better than my fantasies-broad shoulders,firm chest, every part of him exactly as powerful as I'd imagined during those moments I'd caught myself staring at him across conference tables.

"I've thought about this," I admitted as his hands explored my body. "About you."

Howard's eyes locked with mine. "So have I. More than I should have during business hours."

The thought of controlled, composed Howard Thompson distracted by thoughts of me during meetings was unexpectedly thrilling.

His touch was confident but gentle, finding all the right places,drawing responses from me I hadn't known were possible.With Philip, intimacy had been mechanical, something to endure rather than enjoy. Howard made me feel treasured,desired-like an equal partner rather than a possession. When we finally came together, his movements were both confident and attentive. Howard watched my face carefully,adjusting his rhythm whenever my breath caught or my fingers dug into his shoulders. Unlike Philip, who had always treated intimacy as a race to finish, Howard seemed to savor every moment, every touch, every soft gasp he drew from me. "Annie," he whispered my name like a prayer, his control slipping as we moved together. When the tensionfinally broke, waves of pleasure washed over me more intensely than I'd ever experienced. Howard held me through it, his own release following mine. For those moments,I forgot everything-my past, my worries, even my name.
There was only sensation and connection.

After, wrapped in Howard's arms, I felt completely at peace for the first time in years. My body still hummed with satisfaction,little aftershocks of pleasure occasionally making me shiver against him.

"What are you thinking?" he asked, stroking my hair,his fingers tracing lazy patterns against my scalp.

"That reality is better than fantasy," I said honestly. "Much better."


Howard smiled against my temple, pressing a kiss there. "We have an hour before they return." His hand slid down my back,fingers drawing patterns on my skin.

"Already?" I asked, but my body was already responding to his touch, arching into him automatically. "I've waited months for this," Howard said,voice dropping to that low register that made my stomach flutter. He rolled me beneath him, his weight a delicious pressure as he kissed down my neck. I ran my hands over the strong muscles of his back,marveling at how different this felt-how right. Howard's fingers found sensitive places I didn't even know I had, drawing sounds from me I'd never made before.

As we moved together again, slower this time but no less intense, I realized I'd never known it could be like this-a conversation without words, a give and take of pleasure that left me breathless and wanting more even as satisfaction washed over me.
###Chapter 81:Hello?

Philip's POV

I parked my car along the roadside near the Thompson estate, not expecting to see Brian here. He was sitting alone in a car, his gaze fixated on Howard's residence.

I approached the vehicle and gently tapped on the window. "Knock, knock.
"

"Mom is so nice..." I heard Brian muttering to himself. "She gets along with everyone. Mom is so gentle too... she's good to everyone." He sighed deeply. "Too bad... I'll never get to experience that firsthand again..."

Hearing the knocking, Brian turned his head and lowered the window. His chubby face remained expressionless. "Dad, what do you want?"

"I didn't expect to see you here," I said, gesturing toward the mansion."Are you here to see her too?"

I truly didn't understand what had happened. Not long ago, Annie and Howard's relationship was strictly professional, but now they were reportedly quite intimate. This news pierced my chest like a sharp blade.My Annie, my ex-wife, the woman who once obeyed my every wish,had now fallen into another man's arms? During the quiet hours of night,when I closed my eyes, images would appear in my mind-Annie nestled in Howard's embrace as they talked intimately, smiled at each other,and even more intimate contact... These thoughts burned like a raging fire from my chest to my throat,nearly suffocating me. I couldn't sleep, couldn't focus on work, could barely think clearly. I already had Sarah, so why did Annie's situation cause me such agony? This feeling of losing control terrified me and made me furious-how couald I allow Howard Thompson to take everything that should rightfully be mine?

"I just..." Brian's voice grewsofter, "wanted to make sure Mom is doing well."


"I know you refused to help me last time," I continued, "probably because you didn't realize how close they've become."

"Isn't it better that they're close?" Brian calmly responded. "The person you love is Sarah, not her. Mom has finally found someone who loves her..."1


He looked directly at me. "Why are you so obsessed with ruining everything?"

I was speechless.

After a long silence, I finally said, "She was once my wife."

"You said it yourself-'once," Brian answered unhurriedly. "That's already in the past tense."

"I just want to watch from a distance as Mom starts her new life and feels happy," Brian said softly, as if telling himself, "That's enough for me."




Just as Brian and I reached an impasse, my phone suddenly rang. I took out my phone and saw Sarah's name on the screen. I answered with some hesitation: "What is it?" "Philip..." Sarah's voice was sweet and tearful, "I've sprained my ankle. Could you come check on me?" I hesitated. I glanced at Brian, then at Annie on the balcony.
  I didn't know Sarah's exact situation, but I could imagine her pacing around her apartment, repeatedly contemplating her circumstances.Although I claimed to thoughtfully keep her away from Howard, I hadn't actually made an effort to see her.

Brian must have overheard this conversation. I noticed a flash of contempt in his eyes, but he quickly concealed it.

"Dad, even if you go see Sarah, Mom won't be angry," Brian said with feigned understanding. "Mom is a kind woman; she'll understand."

I looked at Brian as he met my gaze. My resolve wavered.

On the other end of the line, Sarah didn't urge me. Instead, she said in a tearful voice, "Philip, it really hurts."

Hearing this, I suddenly made my decision and told Brian, "Wait for me a moment." Then I got into my car and stepped on the gas.

As I drove away, through the rearview mirror, I saw Brian's face break into a contemptuous smile.

"Even at this point, Dad still can't let go of Sarah, yet he dreams of reconciling with Mom..." I thought I heard Brian mutter to himself. "Is he planning to reconcile with Mom while continuing to entangle with Sarah?How disgusting."

Hlis voice grew gentler: "I'm glad Mom found a man who truly loves her and is completely loyal to her."

Through the rearview mirror, I caught a final glimpse of Brian turning back toward the balcony, continuing to watch Annie's figure.



I arrived at Sarah's Brooklyn apartment and rang the doorbell. Standing at the door, I watched as Sarah gently lifted her right foot.lmping painfully to answer. She gave me a fragile smile,"You came?"

My heart instantly softened. Seeing her struggle toward the living room.I lifted her into my arms.


Sarah wrapped her arms around my neck, shedding tears of self-pity."I thought you didn't want to take care of me anymore."

"How could that be?" I placed her on the sofa, knelt before her, and held her hand. "What happened to your foot?"

Sarah looked at her foot, biting her lip as she said, "Living alone, accidents happen.I thought it was just a minor injury and shouldn't bother you.But there's no one here. I'm pregnant, and I still have Max to take care of...



Her eyes filled with tears as she continued, "I can barely walk. I only called you because I had no other choice."

She threw herself into my embrace. Instinctively, I wanted to push her away,but I didn't.

"In the near future, you'll return to Annie," Sarah sobbed. "By then,I'll have to keep my distance from you... I won't be able to embrace you anymore. So now..."

She looked up at me, tears glistening in her eyes, "Please don't reject me.okay?"

Looking at her face, I suddenly wondered if Annie had ever felt this helpless when we were together. I wasn't sure if I was trying to atone, if I genuinely felt sorry for Sarah, or if there was another reason entirely.

In the end, I couldn't be cruel to her. I gently embraced her. Annie was once pregnant too." I said softly. "She would certainly understand your pain."

Sarah didn't respond.

"Even if I reconcile with her, she wouldn't stopy me from caring about you."I continued.


I failed to notice the flash of smugness that crossed Sarah's face. Had I seen it then, perhaps I would have realized how skillfully she manipulated me-a few tears, playing the victim, and I was completely hooked.

But at that moment. I only wanted to do the right thing. I placed my hands on Sarah's shoulders. "I'll call her right now."

Sarah looked at me in confusion.

"I need to clear things up with her in advance," I explained. "That way, if we do reconcile in the future, she won't be angry."


I knew Annie had blocked my number, so mycalls wouldn't go through.I picked up Sarah's phone and dialed Annie's number.

To my surprise, the call connected.

"Hello?" I said, my fingers unconsciously tightening around the phone.
###Chapter 82: I'll Get Jealous

Annie's POV

I rested against Howard's chtest, our bodies still warm from making love.The morning sunlight streamed through the blinds of his bedroom.I traced my finger along his chest, my thoughts drifting to practical matters despite our intimate moment.

"Lucy has an event at school." I said. "We should ask her tomorrow about the exact date."


"Good idea," Howard replied, his hand running lazily up and down my back. He paused before adding, "Having you by my side has made things so much easier for me."


"Oh?" I looked up at him, curious about the sudden admission.

"Before you came to live with us, I had to manage everything myself," he explained. "Especially things related to Lucy... I was constantly worried I'd miss something that might upset her. But now that you've become Lucy's mom. you've taken over these responsibilities."


I smiled and teased him. "With the salary you pay me every month, I'd feel guilty if I didn't handle these things. I'd just be wasting your money,wouldn't I?"


"I don't see it that way, Annie," he said, his fingers brushing my cheek."Even if all you did was keep Lucy company and help her improve, that money would be wel spent."

I paused, touched by his sincerity. "Really?"

Howard leaned forward and kissed me softly, "Yes," he whispered.

I reached for my phone on the nightstand.′′Bthe way, I need to visit my mother in Brooklyn tomorrow."

Howard's hand rested on my hip. "Would you like me to come with you?"

Since making our relationship official, the space between us had changed.His touch felt more honest now,more meaningful.

"Yes, that would be nice," I replied.


We lay together quietly until my phone buzzed. The screen showed a number I didn't recognize. As soon as I answered, I regretted it.

"Annie?" Philip's voice came through-that familiar tone of fake concern that always made my skin crawl.

I sat up straight, my good mood instantly ruined. Howard tensed beside me. "How didI you get this number?" I asked, keeping my voice flat. "I blocked you."

Philip ignored my question. "Sarah is pregnant with my child," he announced as if delivering great news.

I turned to Howard, mouthed "Philip," and put the call on speaker.

"When you forgive me and we remarry," Philip continued with stunning arrogance, "I hope you can be generous enough... to accept this child."

I laughed in disbelief. The nerve of this man! Howard's jaw tightened as he listened.

Philip clearly cared about this unborn baby, though not much for Sarah herself. That would make thetruth about Sarah's manipulation hit him even harder when he eventually learned it.

"When that happens," Philip continued, oblivious to how ridiculous he sounded, "I probably won't be able to love you as completely as before."

 My stomach turned. Six years of matriage to this man,and he still thought this was how to talk to me.

"Because a young child needs more attention and love than you do." he explained in that condescending tone hed used throughout our marriage-the same tone he'd used to explain why he missed Brian's school events or worked through our anniversaties. "Sarah, having also given birth.will need care as well..."

"Stop." I cut him off, my hands clenching into fists. The memories of being ignored and dismissed for years flooded back. "Have I given you any indication that I want to reconcile with you?

There was a pause-Philip clearly hadn't expected resistance to his grand plan.

"No," he finally admitted.

"Good," I said firmly. "I understandI you love Sarah and her child. If you want to build a life with her, that's between you and her. It has nothing to do with me. I won't interfere, and you don't need to inform me about it."

I had better things to do with my time than listen to Philip's self-serving fantasies. Every word from him pulled me back toward that suffocating marriage where nothing I felt or needed ever mattered.

After a long silence, Philip asked. "What would it take for you to forgive me?" His voice had that wounded tone that used to make me doubt myself. "Nothing." I answered immediately, feeling Howard's supportive presence beside me. "Because there's no possibility of us getting back together.Goodbye, Philip." I ended the call and blocked the number again. I tossed my phone aside and fell back against the pillows. "He's unbelievable." Howard pulled me close. "He doesn't deserve a moment of your attention."

I nodded against his chest. "I'd blocked his number, yet he still found a way to contact me. He's certainly persistent."

"Unfortunately, his persistence is completely misguided," Howard said,his voice hardening when discussing Philip.

I sat up and changed the subject. "Rather than thinking about him,I should focus on visiting my mother tomorrow-whether I should bring anything, and how to explain things to her without making her angry."

Howard touched my cheek. "Is she still opposed to your divorce?"

I sighed. "From my mother's perspective, I should never have gotten divorced under any circumstances. I defied her advice. She'll certainly scold me."


Howard's hand moved to my shoulder. "We'll handle it together," he promised, pulling me back into his arms and making me forget everything else.





The following morning, I woke up early in my own room. Howard and I had decided it would be better if I returned to my bedroom before Lucy woke up. After showering and getting dressed, I stepped into the hallway to find Howard waiting. He wore a dark blue silk pajama set that made him look even more handsome than usual. The memory of our night together flashed through my mind-his strong hands, his body against mine. He took my hand, his thumb brushing over my knuckles. The simple touch sent warmth through me. I looked at our linked fingers,still adjusting to this new reality between us. "What are you thinking about?" Howard asked quietly.

I answered honestly,"You."

Howard stopped at Lucy's bedroom door, his eyes fixed on me. "Oh?"

"I just realized that after making our relationship official, I finally understand what normal dating is supposed to be like," I explained.

Before Howard, I had only been with Philip. During our six years together,Philip rarely held my hand or kissed me unless he wanted something.I'd grown to think that was normal. But Howard was different-he touched me simply because he wanted to, not as a transaction or performance.

Howard smiled, a rare sight that transformed his usually serious face.Before he could speak, Lucy's bedroom door opened.

We automatically stepped apart as Lucy appeared in the doorway, eyeing our joined hands with suspicion.

"You two should tone it down a bitin front of me," she said, sounding much older than her five years.

"Okay," I said, letting go of Howard's hand.

Lucy immediately grabbed my hand and pulled me into her bedroom."Mom,when I'm around, you have to act like you love me more,otherwise I'll get jealous." I understood the fear behind her playful demand. "Lucy, it's not just an act-I really do love you," I assured her, kneeling to look her in the eyes.Lucy tried to keep a straight face but couldn't help smiling. "Well, alright then." "By the way, when is your school event happening?" I asked as I fixed her hair. "Probably next week," she said,not completely sure.

My schedule was flexible enough to make it work. "When the day comes,I'Il make sure to clear my schedule to be there with you..."

Lucy's face lit up. After finishing her morning routine, she came out and looked at Howard, who waited patiently in the hall. "Dad, do you have time next week?"


Howard never refused Lucy anything. Even with his demanding job,he would make time for her. "Yes," he answered without hesitation.

"Then can you come with Mom to my preschool event?" Lucy asked hopefully.

"Of course I can," Howard replied1, his expression softening in that special way reserved only for Lucy and me.
###Chapter 83: Mom's Worries

Annie's POV

I scrolled through my phone as Howard drove us to Brooklyn, trying to think of a gift for my mother. Nothing seemed right.

"I should have brought something," I muttered, tapping my screen harder than necessary.


"Still struggling with gift ideas?" Howard asked.

"Mom hates useless things. Clothes are 'too fancy,' decorations 'collect dust,'and flowers 'just die,"I said, mimicking her matter-of-fact tone.

After another minute of pointless scrolling. I opened my banking app instead. Since starting at Howard Technologies, my bank account had grown more than it ever did during six years with Philip. Between my salary, illustration work, and merchandise sales. I now had money that was actually mine.

I transferred $10,000 to my mother's account and texted her about it. Her immediate response was just a question mark.

I smiled. That was so like her -practical, blunt, and always suspicíous when things came too easily.

"Good news?" Howard asked,catching my smile.

"Just Mom being Mom." I put my phone away. "Money is the only gift she won't complain about." As we parked outside her building, Howard looked at me. "Want me to wait here?" "No,come up." I unbuckled my seatbelt. "I want her to see I'm doing fine."
The truth was, I wanted her to see Howard too. Wanted her to know I hadn't crashed and burned without Philip like she'd feared. I wasn't ready to admit how important Howard had become to me, but bringing him to meet my mother felt like a statement.

I knocked firmly on her door.

"Who is it!" Mom shouted from inside.

"It's me,Mom."

The door flew open, and there stood Ruth Miller, gray hair in a tight bun,wearing the same old sweater I'd seen dozens of times.

"You finally remembered your mother exists?" she said, though her eyes brightened seeing me. She noticed Howard and immediately sized him up."Come in,then."


We followed her inside. The apartment was exactly as I remembered-small,worn,but spotlessly clean, just like Mom herself.

We sat down, Howard and I on the couch, Mom in her old armchair.She kept glancing at Howard but grabbed my hand instead of asking about him.


"You mentioned divorcing Philip last time we talked," she said,squeezing my hand. "Been too busy to call and check. What happened?" My stomach tightened. Mom had always been against divorce - she'd survived as a single mother and didn't want that life for me. In her mind,a woman needed a husband for security.

"I already divorced him, Mom." I couldn't meet her eyes.

She smacked my arm hard enough to leave a mark. "Are you stupid?" Her voice rose to a near-shriek as her face contorted with disbelief. "Now that
###Chapter 83: Mom's Worries

other woman gets him for free! Everything you worked for, she just walks in and takes!"

I stayed quiet. Experience had taught me that defending myself would only make things worse.

"I don't care what you say," she continued, leaning forward with her finger jabbing the air between us. Her earrings swung wildly as she shook her head. "You need to get back with Philip immediately. Where's Brian? Is he with you?"

The question stung, but I kept my face blank.

"Listen to your mother," she pressed on, not waiting for my answer. Her hands gripped her knees so tightly her knuckles turned white. "Men can throw away wives, but never their children. That's their blood." She thumped the table for emphasis with each point. "Keep Brian with you,and Philip will come back eventually. Without the boy, he won't even look your way." Mom jumped to her feet so quickly her chair nearly toppled over. Her face turned scarlet, veins bulging at her temples. "Are you trying to kill me?"She pounded her fist against her chest repeatedly, her voice growing hoarse. "Who's going to support you without Philip?" Her arms flew wide,gesturing around the small apartment. "Do you know how hard this world is for a woman alone?" She pulled a crumpled tissue from her pocket and twisted it between her fingers as tears welled in her eyes. Her shoulders trembled slightly. I understood what caused those tears. Mom had worked three jobs sometimes, counted every penny at the grocery store, and worn the same clothes for years so I could have what she never did. Her entire life had taught her one lesson: women need men to survive.

"I support myself now, Mom." I kept my voice steady. "I have a good job and my illustration work. I make more now than I ever did with Philip.This month alone, I earned hundreds of thousands after taxes. Next month will be better."

The word "money" worked like magic. Mom's anger disappeared instantly,replaced by disbelief.

"You're not making this up?" She slowly sat back down.

"No. And I plan to earn enough to take care of both of us when we're older. The money I sent is just the start."

She waved her hand dismissively. "Keep your money. I can take care of myself. What I want to know is about Brian. You really left him completely with Philip?"

"He chose Sarah as his mother," I said simply. "I'm respecting that."

Mom took a deep breath, disappointment written across her face.She stared at me for a long moment.

"You should go now."

I stood up without arguing, Howard, who hadn't said a word the entire time,followed me silently out the door. Once we reached the car, Howard squeezed my shoulder. "Are you okay?" "Ill handle it," I said, blinking back unexpected tears. "She'll come around eventually." Back at the office, I sat at my desk with Mom's words still ringing in my ears. Relief washed over me that I hadn't listened to her about getting Philip back.

What if I had? Philip might have pretended to return, but he would have kept seeing Sarah behind my back.

Eventually, he might have expected me to accept them both in his life. The thought made me sick.

I looked around at my new reality - a job that paid well, a daughter who called me "Mom," and a relationship with Howard built on respect instead of control. For the first time, I felt like I was living my own life,not someone else's.

A knock interrupted my thoughts.

"Come in," I said from my desk.

Susan Moore entered and nodded to me.

She stopped at my desk. "We've finished translating your comnics.The international department will start promotion in a few days. The first animated episode translation is almost done too - it'll be ready in two weeks for simultaneous release."

She set a stack of papers in front of me. "We'll start with a smaller promotion since content is limited. As we translate more, marketing will increase.""Within a year, your comics will be known worldwide," she continued."Merchandise sales will explode. You'll be making more money than you can count." "So I'll actually be rich?" I asked, half-joking. "Definitely," she nodded. "I'm also talking to publishers about printing physical copies."
"But I haven't finished the story yet," I pointed out.

They'll release volumes," she explained. "You have enough for about two books already. And seeing how merchandise sales improve daily, I can't imagine how well the books will sell."
As she talked, a warm sense of pride spread through me. Everything I'd been working for was finally happening.
My fingers traced over the documents, my mind flashing back to Mom's worried face. If only she could see me now. I wasn't Philip's accessory anymore- I was building something real, something mine.
"This is amazing," I told the secretary, not hiding my excitement. "Thank you."

After she left, I leaned back in my chair,smiling. Mom was wrong. I hadn t crashed without Philip - I was soaring. A thriving career, Lucy's love,and Howard's respect. Everything I never thought I could have.
I took a deep breath, almost dizzy with happiness. It felt too perfect, too complete - like a fairy tale ending I'd never dared to hope for. And that's when the tiny voice in my head whspered a warning: Could anything really stay this perfect?
###Chapter 84:Grandma Ruth

Brian's POV

I stared at the ceiling, watching as morning sunlight crept across my bedroom. Another day. The light pattern on my comforter reminded me of how Mom used to point out shapes in the clouds when wwe'd sit in Central Park. My chest tightened at the memory.
Suddenly,I remembered-next week was the big event at preschool. Lucy and I would be reciting a poem together. The thought sat heavy in my stomach like a stone.

All the other kids would have parents there-cheering,taking pictures,beaming with pride. And me? I'd probably be the only one standing alone.Dad barely noticed me anymore. His world revolved around Sarah and her baby now. And Grandma Betty was just as bad, constantly fussing over Sarah like she was already family, like I didn't even exist anymore.
"Brian, time to get up." MMs. Taylor's voice came through the door, crisp and professional.

I dragged myself out of bed and shuffled into the hallway. The breakfast table was already set-a bowl of cereal, sliced fruit, and a glass of orange juice. I sat down and stared at the food. It wasn't anything like Mom's special breakfasts-her banana pancakes shaped like animals or her French toast with cinnamon smiley faces drawn in powdered sugar. But at least there was food. Everything had changed since Mom left. "Thank you," I said quietly, making sure to eat every bite. Mom always said wasting food was disrespectful to those who didn't have enough.Thinking about her advice made my heart ache all over again. After finishing breakfast, I took a deep breath and asked, "Ms. Taylor, my preschool has a parent-child event next week. Could you come?" Ms. Taylor exchanged a quick glance with Mitchell, who stood near the doorway. I could read their concerned expressions-they were worried about overstepping boundaries.

Mitchell cleared his throat. "Would your father be upset if we attended,Brian?"

At the mention of Dad, I felt my chest tighten and the small smile I'd managed disappeared instantly. "Dad only cares about Sarah now," I said,my voice getting smaller. "He won't even notice anything about preschool events."

I looked down at my empty bowl, whispering, "Dad hasn't really been home much lately... and Grandma Betty just wants to take care of Sarah's baby. So don't worry, nobody will care who I invite as my family."

I tried to keep my voice steady, not wanting them to see how much it hurt.But I think they knew anyway, because Mitchell's eyes suddenly got watery.

Mitchell knelt down to my level, meeting my eyes directly."Then I will definitely be there, Brian."
Ms. Taylor quickly added, "I'll come too! We'll both be there to support you!"
A warm feeling spread through my chest, and I couldn't help but smile genuinely. "You're both so nice.Thank you." Back in my room, I sat on the edge of my bed, imagining the day of the event. Would Mom be there? She lived with Lucy now, so she'd definitely attend to watch Lucy perform. That meant she would see me too...right? I went to my closet and carefully looked through every outfit. I needed to wear something really nice so Mom would spot me immediately in the crowd. And I would practice the poem perfectly so when Lucy and I recited it together,Mom would feel proud of me.

Maybe she'd take pictures or videos, and then I'd be on her phone. My eyes got misty thinking about it. I could pretend... just for a little while...that she came for me too.

Standing at the school entrance, I spotted Mom in the distance.She was holding Lucy's hand, with Uncle Howard standing beside them. Lucy hugged Mom's leg,seeming to plead for something. I froze in place,unable to approach them but couldn't look away either.
Mom smiled so gently, stroking Lucy's golden hair with such tenderness.She used to do the same for me-comfort me when I made mistakes,protect me when I was scared. Now all her warmth belonged to Lucy.
I bit my lip hard to keep from crying. Upper East Side Private Preschool boys don't cry in public-Dad always emphasized that.
Lucy skipped happily toward her friend Penny while Mom and Uncle Howard turned toward their car. I wanted so badly to run after them, to shout "Mom!" and make her turn around to see me. But my feet felt rooted to the ground, unable to take a single step.
"She must have seen me," I whispered to myself. "Because I was standing right next to Lucy. Mom must have noticed me."
I convinced myself that Mom had actually come to drop me off too.This thought gave me the strength to walk through the school doors, even though deep down I knew it was just my imagination. I felt my backpack lighten suddenly-Mitchell had taken it from my shoulders. "Brian, I'll pick you up after school," he said kindly. I nodded, "Okay, Mitchell. Thank you." Before entering the classroom, I couldn't help looking back one more time, hoping to catch another glimpse of Mom, but she was already gone.

Back home in the afternoon, I was sitting at my desk doing homework when my phone suddenly rang. Grandma Ruth's number flashed on the screen. I was surprised-she hadn't contacted me in ages.
"Hello?" I answered cautiously.

"Child," Grandma Ruth's warm voice came through the phone,"are you free tonight?"
I immediately relaxed a little. Grandma Ruth's voice was always so gentle,reminding me of Mom. After all, Mom's kindness must have come from her.

"Hmm?" I responded simply, unsure why she was calling out of the blue.

"Grandma misses you," she said in that warm way that sounded a bit like Mom, with her slight Brooklyn accent. "How about visiting Grandma after school?"

Her words sent a wave of warmth through me. Grandma Ruth actually cared about me, unlike Dad and Grandma Betty. I suddenly realized I hadn't visited her since Mom left.

"Yes!" I answered,feeling excited.

"What would you liketo eat? Grandma will cook for you," she asked, her voice full of affection. Mom always taught me not to be picky about food, to be grateful for what I received. "I like everything you make, Grandma," I replied honestly. My answer seemed to touch her, as her voice grew even softer:"Then Grandma will make all your favorite dishes!" "That's wonderful!" I exclaimed, feeling a rush of warmth. Grandma Ruth had always loved me, even after Mom and Dad's divorce, her love remained unchanged.

Hanging up, I leaned back in my chair, feeling a sense of comfort wash over me. I missed Mom terribly, but at least I still had Grandma. Maybe tonight I could ask her about Mom. Grandma Ruth would surely know how Mom was doing, whether she was truly happy. Perhaps I could even gather the courage to tell Grandma Ruth about next week's school event and invite her to attend.

Mitchell entered the room and, seeing my smile, smiled back. "Brian looks happy today?"
"Grandma invited me to her house for dinner," I answered. "Can we go to Brooklyn tonight?"
"Of course," Mitchell nodded. "I'll arrange the car right away."

Thinking about seeing Grandma Ruth, I felt both nervous and excited.I wasn't sure what we'd talk about, but at least at Grandma Ruth's house,I could feel that sense of being loved-the same feeling I had when Mom was around.
###Chapter 85: The Plan Was Brilliant

Caroline Gluck's POV

I stepped out of the elevator into Howard Technologies' pristine lobby,taking a moment to appreciate how my Louboutins clicked satisfyingly against the marble floor. The receptionist smiled at me with that practiced corporate warmth as I flashed my employee badge.
"Good morning, Ms. Gluck."

"Morning, Heather," I replied, making a point to remember her name.People are always more useful when they think you value them.
I'm Caroline Gluck, and I've been working at Howard Technologies for several months now. Most people here see me as a colleague. What they don't know is that I'm also Sarah Johnson's closest confidante-her secret weapon inside these glass walls.
Sarah and I clicked instantly when we met at a charity gala. Both of us understand what it means to be truly cultured, to have an eye for quality that goes beyond mere money. We became fast friends, kindred spirits navigating a world of pretenders.
I made my way to my office, observing my colleagues with the trained eye of someone who grew up in Manhattan's elite circles. Emma from Marketing walked by,Howard Technologies logo emblazoned on her travel mug like some garish billboard. So nouveau riche, I thought. Real class whispers, it doesn't shout. Kevin fromn Tech hurried past in what he probably thought was a decent suit. The shoulders were at least a quarter inch too wide,and the fabric clearly off-the-rack. I doubted he'd ever attended a truly sophisticated social gathering in his life. Poor thing. Miranda from HR nodded at me, her recently dyed hair catching the light in a way that screamed "salon chain" rather than "private stylist." No woman in a high social circle would ever be caught with such obvious coloring.

These people all graduated from prestigious universities, but education can't teach taste. That comes from generations of refinement-something Sarah and I understand implicitly.
I settled at my desk,checking my calendar for the day. Ever since Annie Baker's childish comic series exploded in popularity, Susan Moore had taken complete control of its promotion, shelving my carefully crafted marketing proposals for Sarah.
The thought still irritated me. Annie's simplistic drawings gaining such traction while Sarah's sophisticated storytelling remained underpromoted?Absurd. The masses truly have no discernment.
My phone buzzed with a text from Sarah: Can't wait much longer.Time to make my move on Howard.
I smiled to myself. Sarah was getting impatient, and when Sarah got impatient, things got interesting. Philip Baker had served his purpose as a stepping stone, but Howard Thompson was the real prize-wealthy,powerful, and infinitely more connected than Philip.
I texted back: Don't worry. I'll get you what you need. Speaking to Susan today about resources. Time to see what that glorified secretary was up to. I smoothed my dress and headed toward Susan's office. Susan's office was meticulous but utterly lacking in personality. The framed diplomas, perfectly aligned desk supplies, and that hideous motivational poster about "Determination" screamed middle-class functionality.No original artwork, no family heirlooms-nothing that spoke of history or heritage.

Susan herself was nowhere to beseen, but her computer screen remained on. I glanced around the hallway before stepping closer to peek at her monitor. Always good to know what's happening before asking for favors.
What I saw made my blood boil. A comprehensive plan for Annie's comic empire lay out in meticulous detail:
OPublishing contracts with major houses in twelve countries

OProduction capacity expansion for merchandise

OFactory acquisitions to increase manufacturing scale

OInternational marketing rollout scheduled for next quarter

Unbelievable. A simple secretary was controlling business decisions worth millions of dollars. For some amateur illustrator's childish doodles.Meanwhile,Sarah's sophisticated narrative art languished without proper support.

I heard footsteps and quickly stepped back, assuming a casual pose by the bookshelf. Susan entered carrying a stack of files, her sensible heels making substantially less noise than my designer ones.
"Caroline, I didn't see you scheduled," Susan said, not unkindly but with that slightly officious tone secretaries often adopt to feel important.  "Just thought I'd drop by," I replied with my warmest smile. "Hope I'm not interrupting anything crucial." "Not at all. What can I help you with?" Susan settled into her chair,straightening her serviceable but clearly off-the-rack blazer. I took the visitor's chair, crossing my legs elegantly, "I wanted to discuss a new comic series I've discovered. The content is quite extensive now, and I've drafted a promotion plan that I believe would resonate beautifully with upper-tier demographics."
"Oh? Which series are you referring to?" Susan's expression remained neutral, professional curiosity evident in her tone.
"It's a relatively unknown work," I replied smoothly. "But the artistic voice deserves cultivation. I was hoping we might allocate some resources toward building the creator's platform-similar to what we've done for Annie."

Susan's lips tightened almost imperceptibly. "All promotional resources are currently directed toward Annie's work, per Howard's explicit instructions.Her content has proven market viability."
I maintained my pleasant expression while internally rolling my eyes. This secretary actually thinks she has decision-making authority.
"I completely understand Howard's focus on proven performers,"I said,my voice honey-sweet. "But diversification benefits everyone. Sarah's sophisticated storytelling would attract an elite demographic that might find Annie's work a bit... simplistic."
Susan's professional mask slipped momentarily. "Caroline, with all due respect, company resources aren't allocated based on personal friendships.Annie's work generates substantial revenue and positive brand association.Her merchandising line alone outperforms most of our tech products in profit margin." How dare she speak to me like that? I thought, while maintaining my pleasant expression. One day, when Sarah succeeds with Howard,I'll make sure this overpromoted secretary understands her actual place in the hierarchy. I smiled to myself. This was classic Sarah-bold but clever. "What's your strategy?" "Of course," I said with practiced graciousness, "I completely understand the business perspective. I simply thought Sarah's unique vision might comnplement our existing portfolio."
Susan softened slightly. "All promotional decisions go through proper channels. If Sarah's work has commercial potential, it can be evaluated through standard procedures."

I nodded,accepting defeat for now. "Thank you for clarifying. I appreciate your time."
As I left Susan's office, my smile disappeared the moment her door closed behind me. That woman had no idea who she was dismissing so casually.
Back in my office, I immediately called Sarah, closing my door for privacy.

"You won't believe how dismissive Susan was," I said when Sarah answered. "The woman actually lectured me about 'proper channels' and'proven market viability.' As if she has the first idea about what sophisticated audiences appreciate."
Sarah's voice sounded tired. "Philip was here all night again, talking endlessly about reconciling with Annie while expecting me to comfort him.I'm done playing this waiting game,Caroline."
"I understand completely," I replied, genuinely sympathetic. Sarah deserved better than being Philip's emotional crutch. "Don't worry about your comic promotion. I'll leverage my publishing contacts directly.We don't need Howard Technologies' marketing department." "I need intelligence," Sarah replied. "Howard's schedule, his routines,where he goes when he leaves the building. Can you track that for me?"

"Absolutely," I said, already mentally cataloging what I knew about Howard's patterns. "The security system here logs all executive movements.As an employee, I can easily monitor the building exits without raising suspicion."

"Perfect," Sarah said, her voice gaining energy. "I need to orchestrate accidental meetings-nothing too obvious, just enough to establish a presence in his awareness."

"The coffee shop across from the south entrance," I suggested."He stops there most mornings around 8:30. And there's a restaurant on 53rd where he often takes business lunches on Thursdays."
"You're brilliant, Caroline," Sarah said warmly.

"I'll need photographs," Sarah continued. "Nothing explicit,just images of Howard and me together-angled to appear more intimate than they actually are. Something that could create doubt in Annie's mind if she happened to see them."

"And if she confronts Howard?" I asked, intrigued.

"Even better," Sarah said. "From what you've told me about their relationship, Annie already has insecurities from her marriage to Philip.One accusation leads to defensiveness, defensiveness leads to arguments,arguments create distance." I leaned back in my chair, impressed. "And you'll be there when the distance becomes unbearable.""Exactly," Sarah confirmed. "Small conflicts accumulate into major problems. When Howard finally becomes disillusioned with Annie's constant suspicion, I'll be the understanding, supportive presence he turns to."

The plan was brilliant.

If she succeeded-when she succeeded-my own position at Howard Technologies would be transformed. Perhaps a vice presidency? Director of Marketing? The possibilities were delicious to contemplate.
"I'll start monitoring his movements today," I promised. "And I'll coordinate with building security to ensure your entry won't raise questions."
"Thank you,Caroline," Sarah said warmly. "I knew I could count on you."

After hanging up, I immediately created several social media accounts to promote Sarah's work. A few well-placed posts in the right circles would create a ripple effect of curiosity.
I made notes about hiring a digital marketing team to boost visibility and engagement. If Howard Technologies wouldn't promote Sarah's work,I'd prove them wrong by creating demand independently. Susan Moore would regret dismissing me so casually.
###Chapter 86: Online Storm

Annie's POV

I had just finished my meeting with Susan about the latest analytics for my comic series and returned to my office.
The numbers were excellent, with international engagement exceeding all projections. After arranging to meet again on Friday to discuss merchandise expansion, I settled at my desk and opened my laptop.
Opening the comments section on my latest comic update was usually my favorite part of the day. I loved seeing how readers connected with my story and characters.

But today, my expression froze as I stared at the screen.

"What the hell is this?" I whispered, my heart beginning to race.

The comments section had erupted into chaos. Dozens of messages demanded explanations, accusations flying back and forth-all centered around my characters and their real-life counterparts.
I scrolled frantically to find the source of this sudden storm, and then I saw it-a comment from someone called ReaderForever357:
"I know the author's ex-husband and his first love, the ones portrayed in this comic. They truly love each other. Why does the author paint him as a cheater and her as a home-wrecker? It's unfair and dishonest." My stomach twvisted into knots. What is this? Someone's defending Philip and Sarah? Though no names were mentioned, anyone following my work could easily figure out who the comment referred to.Beneath it, dozens of replies had accumulated: ComicLover45: "Really? The author is lying in her own comic?" TruthSeeker: "So the author twisted the facts? I always thought she was the victim!"
NYCGirl: "Wait, we need to hear the author's explanation before jumping to conclusions."

I took a deep breath, trying to calm my racing heart. Don't panic, Annie. It's just a malicious comment. But my hands still trembled slightly,reminiscent of how I felt when I first discovered Philip's betrayal.

She thinks I'll just sit back and let this happen? I forced myself to calm down. I couldn't respond impulsively-that was exactly what Sarah would want.


After a moment's consideration, I decided on a direct but professional response:
AnnieBakerOfficial: "Are you suggesting that 'true love' justifies a man developing a relationship with another woman after marriage? Even if it violates wedding vows? Even if it hurts his wife and child?"

The comments section went quiet for a few seconds, then the account immediately responded:

ReaderForever357: "If he no longer loves you and you're clinging to the marriage, isn't that your fault? True love comes first. You should understand and let go." I almost laughed out loud. This logic is so twisted it could write fantasy novels. My heartbeat gradually returned to normal as a quiet anger replaced my initial panic. AnnieBakerOfficial: "According to your logic, are marriage vows meaningless? If we accept your premise-that they're true love-then why did he drag out the divorce for so long? Why maintain the appearance of a marriage while having a relationship with 'true love'? Shouldn't true love be brave and honest?"

The pause was longer this time. I could imagine Sarah sitting in her apartment, irritated as she thought about how to respond. Finally:
ReaderForever357: "He just didn't want to hurt you, out of kindness and consideration."

I shook my head, almost feeling sorry for this ridiculous defense.

AnnieBakerOfficial: "Truly kind people don't deceive and betray. Kindness isn't an excuse after betrayal; it's a guide foractions."

The tide in the comments section visibly shifted. Readers began countering the original comment:
ComicLover45: "Wait, so you're defending cheating? What kind of values are these?"

ArtisticSoul: "I get it, this comment is just trying to stir up controversy.The author's response is so professional!"
NYCGirl: "Well said. We support you!"

Seeing the supportive voices, I opened my direct messages and sent a message to the commenter:

"Sarah, did you think I wouldn't recognize you behind a different name?What do you gain by causing chaos in my comments section?"

The reply came almost instantly: "Yes, it's me. So what?" I needed her to understand I wasn't someone to be trifled with. I wasn't the same Annie who would silently swallow her pain anymore. "If you continue spreading lies under my work, I'll publicly expose everything you've done. My portrayal of you in the comic has been quite restrained. Don't test my limits, Sarah. If you truly anger me,things won't end well for you and Philip."
After sending this message, I felt exhausted but resolute. Sarah wouldn't give up easily, but I was no longer the Annie who could be easily defeated.

She wants my fear and uncertainty, but she won't get it.

I stood up and walked to the window, looking toward Howard's office.Should I tell him about this? He would certainly find a way to help me resolve it,perhaps one phone call would be enough to make Sarah back off.
But on second thought, I shook my head. This was my battle,my work.I was no longer the Annie who needed to rely on others. I had the ability to handle this challenge myself, and I was doing it well. The comic was my domain, and I didn't need to hide under Howard's protection.

"I can handle this," I said to myself, turning back to my desk.

Suddenly,my phone started buzzing non-stop. I checked it to find dozens of new notifications flooding in.

"What now?" I muttered.

I opened the first notification, which was a link sent by a reader. The link led to a video telling the story of a woman who went abroad without breaking up with her boyfriend, and another woman who took advantage to insert herself into their relationship. When the first woman returned,the couple rekindled their relationship, but the "interloper" turned around and accused the returning woman of destroying her relationship. The implication couldn't be clearer-Sarah was suggesting that I was the third party in her and Philip's original relationship. The comments section had descended into chaos: TruthSeeker: "So the author herself was the original homewrecker? How hypocritical! I'll never support someone with such double standards!"
MoralHighGround: "Condemning others for something you did yourself?Disgusting! UJnfollowing, I don't want to see the work of a hypocrite anymore!"

NYReader92: "I knew things couldn't be that simple! She's been portraying herself as the victim in her comics all along, but turns out she was the one who destroyed someone else's relationship!"

ArtCritic88: "This is the so-called 'truth'? First interfere with someone else's relationship, then pretend to be the victim? Portraying the ex-husband as the bad guy to gain sympathy? The work of such a person isn't worth following!"

ComicFan2023: "I've always liked your work, but I'm really disappointed after learning this. Creation should be honest, not twisting facts to exonerate yourself!"

BrooklynGirl: "The character in the video is exactly like the 'first love'character in the comic! It's so obvious that the author is talking about how she destroyed someone else's relationship! It seems the 'bad woman' in the comic is actually wronged!"

HonestOpinion: "My mom's family was broken up by a mistress, and seeing someone like Annie still able to parade around makes me angry! I hope more people see the truth!" My heart sank. This time, Sarah wasn't just twisting facts;she was completely inverting black and white. How should I respond to this? A direct denial would seem like quibbling;a detailed explanation would look defensive... Stay calm, Annie. Think about what Howard would do. He always saw through to the essence of things, never swayed by emotions.

I began writing down a response strategy. This wasn't a simple comment attack; it was a carefully planned reputation war. In this battle, I wouldn't surrender easily.
###Chapter 87: Crisis Into Opportunity

Annie's POV

I closed my office door and sank back into my chair, taking deep breaths to calm myself.
Sarah's online attack was spreading faster than I'd anticipated. When I first noticed those comments, I khew this wouldn't end simply.Looking more carefully through my comic's comment section now, it had indeed transformed into a battlefield.

The comment implying I was the "real homewrecker" had sparked a virtual war. Sarah was attempting to flip the narrative completely,portraying herself as the victim while casting me as the manipulative destroyer of her "true love" with Philip. Absolutely ridiculous.
When facing accusations without evidence, countering them is actually quite straightforward. I told myself, calmly beginning to search for what I needed.

Robert Johnson had been a somewhat notable entrepreneur when he married Sarah, and their wedding had been covered by several local New York media outlets. It took me only a few minutes to find exactly what I needed. I first took screenshots of Sarah and Robert's wedding coverage, then retrieved the digital copy of my marriage certificate with Philip from my cloud storage. These two timelines spoke for themselves-Philip and I had married a full year and a half after Sarah and Robert. Before hitting publish, I carefully considered my response:′′SOyou were still dating your ex-boyfriend a year and a half after marrying your husband? Isn't that the definition of 'two-timing?"After posting, the tide in the comments section shifted immediately.My readers quickly realized I was never the "other woman," and Sarah's entire narrative was pure fiction.

Apologies began flooding the comments section:

TruthSeeker: "I'm sorry for jumping to conclusions! She completely misled us!"

ComicLover45: "I can't believe I fell for her lies. Your evidence is irrefutable."

ArtisticSoul: "Timestamps don't lie! You were never the other woman!"

NYCGirl: "I should have been more careful instead of believing random accusations.So sorry,Annie!"

I smiled, graciously accepting their apologies: "If you truly feel guilty,perhaps consider purchasing some merchandise to support my work."

This wasn't a joke. Within minutes, the numbers on my sales dashboard began to skyrocket as if strapped to a rocket. The sting of Sarah's accusations gradually faded, replaced by an odd sense of satisfaction. She had inadvertently helped my business.

She created drama, and I made money. A fair exchange, I'd say.

I wasn't in a rsh for immediate revenge. My plan for dealing with Sarah had already taken shape, but timing was crucial. Her pregnancy temporarily provided her a layer of protection, but once the child was born,I would deliver my specially prepared"gift package," a reminder of the consequences of her actions.

For now, watching readers redirect their anger toward Sarah was satisfaction enough. They flooded her social media, criticizing her for fabricating lies and attempting to manipulate public opinion.
 "She tried to ruin Annie's reputation but only ended up boosting her sales!"

"Who tries to shame a comic artist and ends up advertising for her? Talk about shooting yourself in the foot!"

I was staring at the comments on my screen when my office door suddenly opened.

Howard stood in the doorway, his usually composed face etched with concern. He walked directly to my desk. "How are you feeling?" His voice was noticeably gentler than usual.

"I'm fine, why?" I looked up at him, puzzled.

Howard took my hand, his thumb brushing over my knuckles, sending warmth through me. "Susan mentioned there was a situation online.Someone attacking you?"

"Oh, that." I shook my head with a smile. "Just Sarah causing trouble."

"I handled it easily and managed to damage her reputation in the process,"
I added, a satisfied smile playing on my lips. "Actually, there are more people criticizing her now than me."


Howard's worried expression relaxed, though his hand still held mine."
You're not upset?"

"At this point, being upset wouldn't solve anything."Ianswered honestly."Instead, I asked myself how to turn this crisis into an opportunity.""Look..." I handed him my phone, displaying the dramatically rising curve on my sales dashboard. Howard took the phone,his eyebrows lifting slightly as he reviewed the numbers."You managed to increase sales in this situation? How did you do that?" I explained my strategy in detail, recounting how I had exposed Sarah's lies with concrete eviddence, then channeled readers' sympathy and guilt into merchandise purchases.

"People are fascinated by stories of affairs and betrayal," I explained. "Sarah tried to paint me as the villain who destroyed someone else's relationship, then shamelessly played the victim in my comics."

"When they discovered she had manipulated them, they felt foolish and guilty," I said with a smile. "I simply gave them a way to make amends-by supporting my work."

"Considering how many people were following this drama, even if only one percent decided to buy something..." I gestured toward the still-climbing sales figures.

Howard moved beside me, sitting on my office sofa with his arm naturally resting across my shoulders. His usually cold voice carried unmistakable approval. "Annie, with that mindset, you'll succeed at anything you attempt."

I accepted his praise confidently. "People need to evolve,don't they?Getting stuck in emotional reactions doesn't solve problems."

"When emotions eventually subside, the problem is still there waiting to be addressed," I continued. "Better to handle issues as they arise."
I looked directly into Howard's eyes. "Otherwise, how can we enjoy life?" Howard's lips curved into a rare, genuine smile. "Indeed." After Howard left, I continued monitoring the comments section.Sarah was still attempting to stir up negative sentiments,which I found strangely entertaining. Like a child refusing to admit defeat, repeating the same mistake over and over. I decided to respond publicly again: "Is there a problem? I'm human too-I need to make a living. I have to think about earning enough money to support my mother and myself. What will happen to me when I'm old if I don't maximize my earning potential while I'm young?"

As expected, my fans rallied around this pragmatic viewpoint, redirecting criticism back toward Sarah:

MoralHighGround: "What's wrong with her? Isn't it enough that she's the actual affair partner who destroyed someone else's marriage? Now she keeps harassing the victim's comment section!"

BrooklynGirl: "She tried to deceive all ofus, but our eyes are wide open now. And then she uses these ridiculous excuses to make us attack Annie again? Is she mentally stable?"

HonestOpinion: "The evidence is clear-Annie was never the otherwoman.Sarah needs to stop spreading lies."

Reading these supportive comments, my mood lightened. Leaning back in my chair, I contemplated Sarah's motivations.

She was challenging me out of jealousy over my growing fan base and success. Her attempt to turn readers against me was intended to force me to stop creating altogether. But it had only backfired. The more Sarah wanted me to sop drawing, the more determined I became to continue. I wouldn't just continue creating-I would focus on improving the quality of my storytelling and artwork with each update.The larger my fan base grew, the more frustrated Sarah would become. Until she gave birth, this would be my strategy-to provoke her with my own success. Consider it interest accumulating on the debt of pain Sarah had caused me. And when her child was finally born... I would deliver my special surprise. When that moment came, Sarah would truly regret the harm she had caused.

I refocused on my drawing tablet, channeling my determination into creating better work. The feeling of my fingers sliding across the screen gave me a sense of power-this was my world, my creation,and no one could take that away.
###Chapter 88: Pathetic Me

Philip's POV

I was reviewing the quarterly financial reports for Philip Investment Group.The numbers looked impressive. Even after losing several collaborative projects with Howard Technologies, my company remained strong. That brought me satisfaction.


I glanced at Brian's photo on my desk-him at three years old, laughing at the Central Park Zoo. The empty frame beside it bothered me. I'd removed Annie's photo weeks ago but hadn't replaced it. The empty space made something twist in my chest.

Annie should have returned to me by now. Instead, she was building a new life at Howard Technologies. The thought of her with Howard made my jaw clench. I slammed the financial report shut, making my assistant look up nervously.

My phone rang. Sarah's face on the screen. I paused before answering,surprised by my own reluctance.

"What is it?" My voice sounded cold. I was getting tired of Sarah's constant demands and mood swings. But then I remembered she was carrying my child and tried to soften my tone.

′′Mystomach feels uncomfortable..," Sarah's voice trembled. I recognized the pattern-Sarah always needed me when I was busiest at work."It's all Annie's fault," she continued, sniffling. "She exposed our relationship online." Annie's name made me sit up straight, anger burning in my chest. How dare she? She already had Howard's attention-wasn't that enough? Why couldn't she leave us alone? "People are attacking me, calling me a 'homewrecker,'" Sarah sobbed. "I don't even know what I did wrong."

I felt suddenly protective. Sarah was pregnant with my child. I couldn't let anyone hurt her or my baby, no matter how annoyed I sometimes felt with her. I remembered how Annie needed peace during her pregnancy with Brian. How could Annie attack another pregnant woman? This wasn't like her at all. What happened to the gentle Annie I knew?

"Can you please ask Annie?" Sarah pleaded. "If she tels me what I've done to offend her, I'll correct it immediately!"

I clenched my fist. Some part of me knew I might be getting manipulated,but I was too angry to think clearly. I considered myself a logical businessman, but with Annie and Sarah, I always ended uap ruled by emotions.

"T'll handle this," I said, ending the call. I needed to confront Annie.How could she treat a pregnant woman this way,especially after going through pregnancy herself?

I stared at Howard's contact on my phone. I couldn't call Annie directly-she'd blocked my number. But I could reach her through Howard. This wasn't about winning Annie back, I told myself. This was about protecting Sarah and my unborn child.

I pressed call. Howard answered with a cool "Can I help you?" He sounded surprised to hear from me. I didn't waste time: "Ask Annie why, as a woman, she keeps targeting another woman.What's the point of that?" The anger in my voice gave me satisfaction. I wanted Howard to see Annie's flaws-to see her spiteful side.Maybe then he wouldn't think she was so perfect. "Could you clarify which lady Annie is allegedly harassing?"Howard remained calm, almost sarcastic. His tone suggested my accusations were ridiculous, That made me even angrier.

"Sarah Johnson," I said, my teeth clenched tight.

The line went quiet. I pictured Howard looking down on me-this man who had taken everything that should be mine: my wife, my son's affection,even my social position. My jealousy burned hotter.

"Mr. Thompson, this doesn't concern you," I said, trying to sound calm."I don't want to direct my anger at innocent people, so please put Annie on the phone." I sounded polite, but inside I was furious. Who was he to get between Annie and me? This was our business.

"She is my girlfriend," Howard stated firmly. Each word felt like a knife in my chest. "And I've heard about the conflict between them today."
"So you're protecting her?" I asked mockingly, my anger obvious.

Howard laughed coldly. "What else would I do?"

Every word he spoke made me angrier. "Throughout this entire situation,she hasn't done anything wrong. What kind of boyfriend would I be if I let you lecture her?" Hearing him call himself Annie's "boyfriend" made me dizzy with rage.Even though I had Sarah, even though I ended my marriage to Annie,I couldn't accept her being with someone else. Annie should always be mine.This thought was ugly, and it disgusted me, but I couldn't deny it was there. "Since their conflict began online, Isuggest you search for the complete story there first," Howard said calmly. He was talking to me like I was a child. "Understand the truth before passing judgment." His tone made my blood boil, "Our companies maintain a partnership," Howard continued, "yet you're easily provoked by Sarah's words, quick to attack my girlfriend without considering the consequences. This seriously calls into question your professional judgment."

His words hit me like cold water. Was he threatening my business? Over a woman? "After all that talk, you just want me to leave Annie alone,right?"I almost shouted.


"From a professional standpoint, your impulsiveness makes you an unreliable partner," he said flatly. Each word stung my pride. "From a personal standpoint, you claim to love Annie, yet you consistently doubt and criticize her based on others' accusations."

"I regret everything Annie once had to endure," Howard added. Those words stabln business, people always respectebed my heart.

d me, flattered me, did what I wanted. Howard showed me none of that.He was suggesting I'd been a terrible husband who didn't deserve Annie.The worst part? Deep down, I knew he was right. That made me even angrier.


"Learn the details of the situation first," Howard suggested. He used the same superior tone I often used with my employees. Being talked to this way made me feel both ashamed and furious.

"Fine, I will," I snapped back. I grabbed my phone and searched social media. The first comments I found did criticize Sarah, just as she claimed. My anger grew-how could Annie be so cruel? This wasn't like her at all. But something made me keep searching. I needed to know why strangers were defending Annie. After more searching, I found a video showing what really happened: OSarah had first attacked Annie's comics and character

DAnnie had responded with evidence showing Sarah started it

OSarah had lied more,claiming Annie was the real "other woman"

DAnnie had posted our marriage certificate and Sarah's wedding announcement with her ex-husband, proving who was lying

My anger vanished, replaced by shame and embarrassment. Sarah had tricked me again, and I'd fallen for it like an idiot. I'd accused Annie without checking facts first. This wasn't even the first time-I'd believed Sarah's lies about Brian before too. Why did I let Sarah manipulate me so easily? Maybe because she knew exactly how to trigger my need to control Annie?

A horrible thought hit me: maybe I didn't really love Annie. Maybe I just couldn't stand her being outside my control. I couldn't accept that she was happier without me than she ever was with me. The thought made me sick,but I knew it was true.

"Have you finished reading, Mr. Baker?" Howard's voice startled me-I'd forgotten he was still on the line.

"Yes," I answered, feeling like a child caught doing something wrong.

"Do you still want to defend Sarah?" OSarah had first attacked Annie's comics and character

"Yes," I answered, feeling like a child caught doing something wrong.

"Do you still want to defend Sarah?" I couldn't answer. I was too ashamed. Once again, I'd made a fool of myself in front of Howard, proving he was right about me all along."There's nothing wrong with acting foolishly, as long as you recognize your limitations," Howard said calmly, but with a sharp edge. "If Annie truly wanted to create trouble for both of you, she's had plenty of opportunities. But she hasn't. She just wants to forget everything related to you. Yet you two keep entangling her." Each word hit me hard. The worst part was knowing he was right. Annie never started these conflicts-it was always Sarah and me who wouldn't leave her alone.


"Why?" Howard spoke slowly. "Do you think she's easy to bully because she has no one protecting her?"

That hurt. I should have been Annie's protector, not someone who hurt her. Now Howard protected her, and I was the person she needed protection from. This complete role reversal made me feel lost and jealous.

"No, absolutely not," I denied quickly, but my voice gave me away.

"Good," Howard said with disgust and hung up.

I sat in the dark of my study, flipping through photos of Annie and me.

A thought of Howard's arm around her waist sent me lurching to my feet,my fist clenched tight. The phone screen cracked under my grip,a jagged line splitting across our faces.

I threw the phone onto my chair and caught my reflection in the window-hair disheveled, expensive shirt wrinkled. A bitter laugh escaped me.


Here I was, Philip Baker, Harvard Business School graduate, CEO of a major investment firm-pacing around like a teenager over a woman I claimed not to want. Outmaneuvered by Sarah, outclassed by Howard,yet somehow still convinced of my own brilliance. Pathetic.
###Chapter 89: The Prank

Howard's POV

I hung up the phone, feeling a wave of disgust wash over me. This marked the third time Philip had called regarding Sarah's complaints about Annie. I've encountered countless adversaries in the business world,but rarely someone as lacking in judgment yet so self-assured as Philip Baker. An involuntary smirk crossed my lips as my fingers drummed lightly against the polished surface of my desk. The man was utterly foolish.


Annie emerged from a nearby room, immediately reading my expression.

"Philip again?" she asked, leaning against the doorframe.

I nodded, making no effort to conceal thecontempt in my eyes."Mr.Baker seems to believe his ex-wife is bullying his poor pregnant girlfriend online." I deliberately lowered my voice, infusing it with unmistakable sarcasm. "What an absurd accusation."

Annie walked over and settled onto the sofa. "I figured as much. Sarah faces resistance online and runs straight to him crying." I moved to join her, pulling her gently ontomy lap. I couldn't keep the disgust from my voice. "This so-called top-tier investor jumps to conclusions without performing even the most basic fact-checking." I ran my thumb over her knuckles, feeling the softness of her skin."What's more ridiculous is that he claims to love you while consistently defending someone who hurts you.""He never truly loved me," Annie stated calmly. "He just wants me back to play nursemaid when Sarah gives birth." A surge of anger rose within me. "What did he do to you?" Annie averted her gaze. "When I was still in the hospital after my miscarriage, he brought Sarah home and let her sleep in our master bedroom while arranging for me to stay in the guest room."

My body tensed instantly, a fierce protective instinet burning in my chest.If Philip had been standing before me at that moment, I couldn't guarantee I would maintain my composure. Imagining Annie lying alone in a hospital bed while her husband welcomed another woman into their marital bed-such behavior was utterly repulsive.

After taking a deep breath, I managed to say with forced calm,"Aman without principles." But I knew my voice was cold enough to freeze theair between us.


"Sarah's been causing you trouble lately. Would you like me to intervene?"I asked, already mentally listing three potential strategies to silence Sarah permanently.

Annie shook her head with a slight smile. "That won't be necessary. Her antics have actually brought me more readers and increased sales." She looked up at me, her eyes shining with determination. "I can handle this."

I gazed at her confident, composed demeanor, feeling genuine admiration sweep through me. To remain so resilient in the face of such challenges,transforming obstacles into opportunities-Annie's strength and intelligence never ceased to amaze me. This was one of the many reasons I found myself so deeply captivated by her. I squeezed her hand gently. "Ifyou need anything, juast tell me." I heard my own voice soften. Annie leaned against my shoulder, and I could feel her body relaxing. It occurred to me that during her time with her ex-husband,she had never received this kind of support. This strong woman in my arms had once been forced to face every storm alone. "It's noon already. Shall we have lunch together?" I asked quietly.

"Yes," Annie nodded in agreement.

I took Annie to a small restaurant hidden in a narrow alley in Midtown Manhattan.


"Susan recommended it," I explained simply. "The chef is supposedly quite skilled."

When the food arrived, Annie took a bite and her eyes brightened. "This is really excellent."

I watched her expression with a sense of satisfaction.

Suddenly,a young woman bounded up to our table, her eyes wide with excitement.

"Mr. Thompson! You really came!" she exclaimed. "I'm Molly from the marketing department. This is my family's restaurant!"

Before I could respond, she dashed toward the kitchen. "I'll have Dad prepare some special dishes!"

Annie raised an eyebrow at me. "A friend?"

I shook my head. "I'm not even sure who recommended this place." I took out my phone and called Susan to inquire about the situation. After a brief conversation, I hung up, feeling slightly puzzled. Just then,Molly returned with a plate of bright red food and was about to sit down beside me. "Do you mind if I sit here?" she asked Annie."Actually, I do mínd," Annie replied frankly. Molly blinked. "Then can I sit next to you instead?"

Annie nodded in agreement, and Molly immediately began enthusiastically serving her food. "My father's spicy stir-fried pork is our signature dish!"

I noticed that all the newly arrived dishes were unusually red and spicy,and more strangely, Molly's attention had completely shifted from me to Annie.Something didn't feel right.

Annie took a bite, and I could telI the food was extremely spicy, but she maintained a composed expression. "A very unique flavor."

"Right?!" Molly's face lit up with excitement.

After finishing our meal, Molly mentioned she needed to stay behind to help,so I escorted Annie back to the office.

Back in my office, I led Annie to my private lounge area.

"I noticed something interesting earlier," I leaned closer to her, lowering my voice. "You seem particularly adept at charming women who are initially interested in me."

Annie laughed. "What are you talking about?"

"First Catherine Morgan, now Molly," I gently caressed her cheek. "The moment they see you, they can't take their eyes off you."

"Are you jealous?" Annie moved closer, wrapping her arms around my neck. I shook my head, feeling an unusual sense of humor. "Just observing an interesting phenomenon." My voice unconsciously deepened. "But I can hardly blame them..." I leaned in to kiss her lips. The kiss started gently, then gradually deepened. I felt her close her eyes, grip my shirt tightly, and instinctively move closer. Her body heat radiated through the thin fabric of her blouse,making my heart race.

My hand slid from her waist to the small of her back, savoring the softness and curves I found there. Images of last night flashed through my mind-her naked beneath me, her skin glowing enticingly in the moonlight,her lips parted, the sounds she made driving me to the edge of reason. I wanted to feel all of her again, to press her down onto the office sofa,unbutton her blouse, and taste every inch of her skin with my tongue.

Just as I was about to take things further, an intense burning sensation suddenly spread from my lips, forcing me to pull back abruptly. My expression must have been quite distorted.

"What's wrong?" Annie looked at me, confused.

"Too spicy," I frowned, my lips stinging painfully.

Annie finally realized that the spice from lunch had lingered on her lips.Seeing my expression, she couldn't help but smile. "Should I get you something to drink?"

"There's a vending machine downstairs," I nodded, feeling extremely uncomfortable.

On our way out of the office, my keen eyes caught two figures hastily ducking around the corner of the hallway-Catherine's blonde hair and Molly's distinctive jacket. I immediately understoodeverything. Molly had deliberately served the spiciest dishes to Annie but not to me-this was a carefully designed prank. Catherine and Molly must have conspired together, aiming to make me burn when kissing Annie. Watching them hiding in the corner,giggling,I maintained my composure externally while internally beginning to contemplate how to respond to this "amusing" challenge. Howard Technologies never lacks creativity, and as CEO, I have a responsibility to demonstrate the company's innovative capabilities, even when it comes to pranks. Catherine and Molly had clearly forgotten one important fact: in this building, the true master of strategic planning is me.

I glanced at Annie following behind me and decided not to tell her the truth just yet. The opportunity to respond to this prank would come,and the method would need to be memorable enough.
###Chapter 90: A Taste of Revenge

Catherine's POV

Molly dashed out of the restaurant and headed straight for the Tech Department, where I was waiting. This recent addition to Howard Technologies' marketing team had quickly become one of my few genuine friends at the company. Her love of gossip and practical jokes unexpectedly matched my own temperament. Though sometimes too straightorward, her innocent enthusiasm always made our dull workdays more entertaining.

I spotted her from across the hallway, her face flushed with excitement as she waved frantically.

"Catherine!" she called breathlessly, clearly winded from running.

I immediately went to meet her, eager to know the results of our little scheme. "How did it go?"

Molly's eyes sparkled with mischief. "I followed your plan exactly! Annie had no idea, and she tried all the spiciest dishes."


I couldn't help but smile slyly. "Excellent. Let's go watch what happens next."


As we hurried through the corridors of Howard Technologies,I found myself contemplating my complex feelings toward Howard Thompson.While he'd been decent enough to me-even offering my father some investment advice-I knew it was only because of Annie.'In fact, I distinctly felt that Howard didn't particularly like me.

No, that wasn't quite accurate. More precisely, Howard seemed to view me as an interloper-an uanwelcome visitor interrupting his private moments with Annie.This thought irritated me. Annie and I were good friends! It was perfectly natural for us to spend time together. Howard had absolutely no right to be annoyed by our friendship.

"Hurry up!" I pulled Molly by the hand toward our hiding spot near the elevators.

We carefully concealed ourselves around the corner, waiting for Howard and Annie to emerge from his office. The spicy food prank was simple yet brilliant-Molly had deliberately served extremely spicy dishes only to Annie and not to Howard, so when they kissed (as couples inevitably do),Howard would feel an unexpected burning sensation on his lips.

As we waited, I recalled how Margaret Thompson had once inadvertently revealed at a charity gala that her seemingly invincible son Howard had a little secret: he couldn't handle spicy food at all. Even the tiniest bit of chili would make him lose his composure. This had been the inspiration for our prank.

When Howard and Annie finally walked toward the elevator, I glimpsed Howard's momentarily comical expression-his eyebrows twisted upward,his lips trembling slightly, and fine beads of sweat forming on his forehead.That perfectly maintained mask of cool composure had crumbled instantly.He quickly turned away, as if not wanting Annie to notice his discomfort.

After the elevator doors closed, we finally emerged from our hiding place.

"Success!" Molly and I high-fived. The prank had gone exactly according to plan.

"Yes!" Molly could barely contain her joy, clapping her hands together. I proudly lifted my chin, like a swan displaying its elegance. "From this moment on, all past tension between Howard and me is officially erased!" Molly looked at me with fresh curíosity. "You actually know Mr. Thompson personally?"

She clearly assumed we were just regular employees who could only admire Howard from afar in the hallways.

"I once pursued him," I answered without hesitation.

Molly's eyes widened in disbelief. "Are you serious?"

"Of course," I confirmed. I'd always been someone who owned up to my actions.

Molly blinked rapidly, processing this information. "I heard that employees who show interest in him or confess get either demoted or fired.



She leaned in closer, lowering her voice to a whisper. "How are you still working at Howard Technologies? Does he secretly have feelings for you?"

Her ridiculous suggestion made me laugh. "Absolutely not."

Molly tilted her head, looking confused. "No?"

"When I confessed to him, he made it very clear he wasn't interested in me,"I explained matter-of-factly. "Later, after Annie and I became friends, he let me work at Howard Technologies as a favor to her."


"Oh. I see," Molly said, sounding somewhat disappointed. "I thought I was witnessing the beginning of a passionate office romance!" Hearing this, I quickly glanced around to ensure no one could overhear our conversation. Once I confirmed we were alone, I leaned toward Molly. "Don't ever say anything like that again," I warned her seriously."If Howard heard you saying such things..." I paused for emphasis,"he would fire me without hesitation!" Molly immediately covered her mouth with her hand. "I understand! I won't mention it again!"

However,our celebration was quickly interrupted. My phone suddenly rang, the screen displaying Howard's direct line. My heart sank, and after a moment's hesitation,I answered.


"Miss Morgan, please bring Molly to my office immediately." Howard's voice was brief and forceful. He hung up without waiting for my response.

After ending the call. I felt a chill creep up my spine. I looked at Molly,who was still blinking those innocent wide eyes, seemingly unaware of the danger we now faced.

"What's wrong?" she asked, noticing my change in mood.

I maintained a serious expression. "Howard wants to see us."

"Then let's go," Molly replied casually.

I pulled her aside and whispered in her ear: "Have you forgotten we just pranked him?"


My reminder finally made Molly realize the potential consequences of our actions. Her eyes widened with anxiety. "Do you think he's going to get back at us?"


"Possibly," I patted her shoulder reassuringly. "We both need to be mentally prepared. Whatever he says, we absolutely cannot show any unusual reaction. Understand?"


Molly's expression immediately became serious. "Understood!"
###Chapter 91: A Taste of Revenge Part II

Howard's POV

I observed Catherine and Molly nervously approaching my office.

After receiving my call, these two women had delayed a full twenty minutes before appearing. Standing before me now, they deliberately maintained some distance from each other, as if trying to dissociate themselves.


Catherine's face was noticeably pale, her fingers constantly twisting together; Molly's gaze darted around, avoidingdirect eye contact with me.Seeing their nervous demeanor, I nearly laughed out loud but maintained my expressionless facade.

I casually set down the documents on my desk and addressed them in a deliberately controlled tone: "There's a new game project I'd like to assign to both of you. I specifically called you here to ask..."

I paused meaningfully, noting how Catherine's shoulders visibly tensed and Molly held her breath. Then I continued,"...if you have the capacity to take on this responsibility."

My tone remained strictly professional, without any indicaton that I was aware of their prank.

Catherine appeared momentarily stunned by this unexpected turn.She blinked rapidly, her lips parting slightly before closing again. Molly glanced toward Catherine, uncertain how to respond,her fingers nervously fidgeting with the hem of her clothing."Well?" I prompted simply. "We'd be happy to take it on!" Catherine responded eagerly without hesitation. Her voice suddenly rose by about eight pitches, her shoulders visibly relaxing.

I calmly continued, "I've already spoken with the department head. You can meet with him directly on the twentieth floor."


"That's great!" Both women noticeably relaxed, the tension leaving their faces as they excitedly left my office.

I watched them go, finally allowing myself a small satisfied smile.
Everything was proceeding according to my expectations.

*I always remember a slight.*

*Dare to play a prank on me?*

*I will certainly retaliate.*

*Though my methods are rarely obvious, people typically don't realize what's happened even after suffering the consequences.*

The office door was gently knocked on again, and Annie walked in. She had noticed my earlier interaction with Catherine and Molly, her expression curious. "Isn't there only one new project in the gaming department?" She paused before continuing, "I remember you discussing it with Susan. Wasn't that project particularly urgent?"

I allowed my expression to soften, explaining with a hint of humor: "That's correct."I elaborated, "Catherine has too much free time in the marketing department. She never does any actual work, just spreads gossip...""If we don't assign her to a department where she'll be appropriately challenged and busy, she might leave the company without learning anything of value."I took Annie's hand, feeling the softness of her skin, and added, "I simply want her to learn more skills."

My gaze fell on Annie's rosy lips, recalling the taste of chili, and I inwardly winced.


Catherine, that overly active social media enthusiast. She was too fond of meddling-this time she had even managed to get Annie to eat spicy food without direct intervention, thereby preventing me from kissing Annie.

I leaned back in my chair, my fingertips lightly tapping the desk as I contemplated my next move. I imagined that during the next group meal,Catherine might recommend extremely spicy dishes to Annie under the guise of sharing food recommendations. If this situation repeated itself,would Annie and I ever be able to kiss again?

No, I firmly refused to let anyone deprive me of intimate moments with Annie.


Just then, Susan called to inform me that the car was ready, reminding me that I had a business meeting to attend today. After explaining the situation to Annie, I made my way to the underground parking garage.




In the underground parking garage, I sat in the back seat as the driver started the engine. The driver braked promptly, and I suddenly noticed Sarah Johnson standing not far ahead, her visibly pregnant figure particularly striking in the sunlight. My eyes revealed undisguised contempt.I recalled that just yesterday she had been causing trouble for Annie online,and now she appeared at the company. I wondered what new plan she had to make Annie uncomfortable. Closing my eyes, I gently pressed my temples, considering how to permanently resolve this issue. Though Annie didn't want my help, being constantly harassed by someone like Sarah must be frustrating.

Seeing Sarah standing there, her gaze fixed on my car, I could guess what she was planning. This woman's behavior was too obvious, her amateur performance almost laughable. I instructed my driver: "Mitchell, slow down and pay attention to the lady ahead."

When my driver unexpectedly braked early. Sarah seemed somewhat taken aback, her prepared posture suddenly becoming awkward. Unwilling to miss this opportunity to interact with me, she quickly adjusted her strategy and walked directly toward my window.

"Stop," I commanded, while observing Sarah's eager approach. I lowered the window, curious about what new trouble she intended to create.

Sarah got straight to the point: "I want to talk to you about Annie Baker."Her voice was deliberately gentle, but the calculation in her eyes was unmistakable.


I responded coldly: "If I want to know anything about her, I'll ask her directly. I don't need you to tell me." My fingers tapped lightly on my knee,my patience limited. "Is there anything else?"

"I know you love Annie..." Sarah continued through gritted teeth, the jealousy in her expression distorting her makeup. I could sense that my protection of Annie would only increase her resentment toward Annie. She couldn't understand why a woman who couldn't even keep her own husband could now receive unconditional love from another man. Sarah continued with a light laugh: "And you trust her completely."Her tone became mysterious, as if she possessed some important secret. "You can choose not to listen to me, to remain in the dark forever." I looked at her deliberately mysterious expression, feeling only disgust. She paused, attempting to create a dramatic effect: "But can you guarantee that when you finally learn the truth...your relationship won't be affected at all?
###Chapter 92: No One Can Stop Me

Sarah's POV

I stood in the underground parking garage of Howard Technologies,gently caressing my protruding belly, my eyes fixed on the sleek black luxury car slowly approaching. Caroline had just texted to inform me that Howard was heading out for a business lunch meeting. As an insider at Howard's company, Caroline could easily access his schedule-information crucial to our plan.

My original strategy was to "accidentally" rush in front of Howard's car as it was leaving the garage, then pretend to be knocked down before the vehicle actually made contact. I would fall to the ground, screaming and clutching my stomach. This "accident" would force Howard to take me to the hospital. Afterward, I'd seize the opportunity to accuse him of hitting a pregnant woman, threatening to expose the incident online if he didn't take responsibility. Howard Technologies' stock would surely plummet,and Howard would be compelled to visit me daily at the hospital. Through these regular interactions, I was certain we would develop some kind of connection.


However, things didn't go according to plan. The black luxury car slowed prematurely, then came to a complete stop. The driver had clearly spotted me in advance. My plan was ruined.

*Damn it! This isn't how I imagined this would go.*

But with Howard right there in the car, I didn't want to miss this rare opportunity. I immediately adjusted my approach, walking as naturally as possible toward the window. I watched as the window slowly lowered,revealing Howard's perpetually expressionless face.

"I want to talk to you about Annie Baker," I made my voice sound as gentle as possible, hoping to capture his attention. "If I want to know anything about her, I'll ask her directly. I don't need you to tell me," Howard responded coldly, his fingers lightly tapping his knee. "Is there anything else?"

*So arrogant! No wonder Philip always complains about him. But you'll listen to what I have to say-no one can resist the information I'm about to reveal.*

"I know you love Annie..." I worked hard to control the jealousy in my voice. Looking at him, this high-and-mighty man so protective of Annie,I couldn't understand it. Why would a woman who couldn't even keep her own husband now receive all the attention of another man? It wasn't fair!

I continued with a light laugh: "And you trust her completely." I deliberately mnade my tone mysterious, as if I possessed some important secret.

"You can choose not to listen to me,to remain in the dark forever," I stared directly into his eyes, "but can you guarantee that when you finally learn the truth... your relationship won't be affected at all?"

Howard stared at me, his gaze so piercing it felt like he could see through my soul. I felt a wave of discomfort, but I couldn't back down now.

"Even if you truly don't care, you could at least hear me out," I added. "After knowing the truth, if you're certain it won't trouble you, then you can send me away. Isn't that fair?"

To my surprise, Howard signaled his driver to open the passenger door."Get in and talk," he commanded briefly.

*Perfect! He took the bait!*

I had intended to sit next to Howard, but when I opened the door, I found he had deliberately positioned himself on the side furthest from the door,maintaining an obvious distance between us. This small gesture irritated me, but I controlled my expression and gracefully slid into the car.

This was my first time observing Howard up close. His profile was sharply defined, his jawline angular, exuding an unapproachable, austere quality.He wore a perfectly tailored suit, every detail exuding refinement and power. Though I hated to admit it, he was indeed more masculine than Philip, more reassuring. He radiated a steady strength that didn't come from his appearance but from his inner confidence and control.

*No wonder Annie is attracted to him. What a shame-if we had met under different circumstances, perhaps...*

I quickly adjusted my thoughts, focusing on my plan. "Did you know how promiscuous Annie was before she got together with you?" I began my offensive.

Howard's lips curved slightly upward, as if mocking my attempt. "She only dated one man, married him, and eventually divorced him because her husband cheated." His cold gaze turned toward me, his tone clearly sarcastic. "If such a woman is considered promiscuous... what does that make a woman like you?"

*Damn him! How dare he belittle me like this?*

I felt my face burning, as if I'd swallowed fire. I almost lashed back.wanting to tell him he knew nothing about me, that I wasn't the kind of woman he imagined. But I had to stay calm, for the sake of my ultimate goal. After taking a deep breath, I changed tactics: "Before you defend her, do you know how she lost the baby in her womb?" Howard merely raised an eyebrow: "Oh?" *That's it, show interest. Now I'll deliver the fatal blow!* I couldn't help smiling, certain Howard would soon change his view of Annie. "Because she was unfaithful during her marriage, she had an affair with my husband, slept with him, and that's what caused her miscarriage!"


I eagerly observed Howard's reaction, expecting to see shock,anger,or at least doubt cross his face. I fantasized about him immediately pulling out his phone to confront Annie. However, his expression didn't change in the slightest.


"First, you've already divorced the man you call your husband,so he should be referred to as your ex-husband," Howard calmly corrected me.

*What? Is that all he cares about?*


"You can't change your ex-husband's relationship status just because you seduced someone else and became the other woman," he continued, his voice infuriatingly steady. "Don't try to smear Annie by implying she's the same kind of woman as you, one who seduces another's husband."

*This bastard! How dare he speak to me this way!*

"Second, her miscarriage occurred before she had any relationship with your husband," he added.

*How would he know that? Does Annie tell him everything? Even something like this?*

I felt a pang of jealousy pierce my heart. Philip and I never had that kind of honesty. "And, when she fell down the stairs, I was the one who took her to the emergency room," Howard's words felt like a bucket of cold water poured over my head. *What? Him? How is that possible?* I struggled to hide my surprise, hastily countering, "You got her there in time, so the baby was saved! It was only because she was having an affair with my ex-husband that she lost the baby!"

Howard's eyes suddenly became sharp and dangerous: "Do you think I'm an idiot? How could a baby survive a fall from that height? Why don't you try it yourself? If your baby survives such a fall, then I'll believe what you say."

*Is he threatening me and my baby? This cold-blooded bastard!*

I felt a wave of fear and instinctively shielded my stomach.

"Stop the car!" Howard suddenly commanded.

The driver immediately pulled over.

"You need to get out now," Howard said, the disgust in his voice making me feel a wave of humiliation.


I wanted to argue, to continue with my plan, but looking at Howard's icy stare, I realized my attempt had failed. I reluctantly exited the car, the door slamming shut behind me.


Standing on the sidewalk, watching Howard's car disappear into the distance, I felt a míxture of frustration and anger.

*Why didn't it work? My tactics always worked on Philip.* I bit my lip, thinking. Aren't all men concerned about whether their women are "pure"? Why was Howard completely unmoved by the suggestion that Annie might have cheated? *Perhaps he truly loves her. Perhaps their relationship is deeper than I imagined.* This thought irritated me even more. My approach must have been flawed. Howard clearly didn't care about what I mentioned. I needed to reconsider my strategy.

I took out my phone and dialed Caroline's number.

"Did you get the photos?" I asked directly.

"Of course," Caroline answered confidently. "Though they're just scenes of ordinary conversation. I managed to capture some special angles. Even strangers looking at these photos would think there's something special between you two."


My mood immediately improving. Although today's plan hadn't been completely successful, it was just the beginning. I had more strategies,more methods.


I would get everything I wanted, and no one could stop me. 
###Chapter 93: False Evidence

Annie's POV

I sat in my new office at Howard Technologies reviewing files for my children's book. My small office wasn't much, but it was quiet enough for me to work without interruptions. Howard was at a business mneeting.giving me time to focus on my drafts.

As I traced the outline of my new character with my finger, I noticed how different this story felt from my previous ones. It was brighter somehow,more optimistic. Maybe it reflected the changes in my own life lately.

A knock at the door interrupted my thoughts.

"Come in," I called,assuming it was Susan with some documents.

The door opened and a woman I didn't recognize walked in. She was in her early thirties, wearing a white suit with her golden-brown hair in a tight bun. She looked perfectly put together, but something about her eyes made me instantly uncomfortable and her perfume was suffocating.

"Hello, I'm Caroline Gluck from Marketing," she said with a smile that seemed rehearsed. "I came to see you. Someone sent me some photos I think you should look at."

I looked up, realizing this was my first time meeting Caroline in person.We'd exchanged a few messages before, but that was it. The moment I saw her fake smile that didn't reach her eyes, my internal alarm went off. "Nice to finally meet you in person, Annie. We've chatted a bit on the phone, remember?" Her voice was honey-sweet, but with an undercurrent I couldn't quite place.I nodded politely, maintaining a friendly facade while my internal radar went on high alert. Why would she suddenly appear at my office? Andwhat photos could be so important?

Something wasn't right.

"I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in photos," I replied calmly,returning my attention to my sketches.

Caroline ignored my response completely. She stepped forward and placed her phone directly in front of me. "Look, Howard and Sarah look so much like a couple here, don't they?"

The screen displayed several photos of Howard and Sarah talking inside a car. Though the conversation appeared ordinary, the angles had been carefully manipulated to create an impression of intimacy. In one, Sarah leaned forward, her face uncomfortably close to Howard's. In another,Howard's hand appeared to be reaching toward her, though it was clearly just the awkward perspective.

My stomach dropped as I stared at the photos. They weren't random snapshots-they'd been carefully staged. I glanced up and caught Caroline watching me with eager eyes. She leaned forward, tapping her fingers on my desk, clearly waiting for me to break down.

It hit me then: Caroline and Sarah were working together. Only Sarah would know Howard's schedule well enough to set up this "chance"meeting. Caroline's job was to show me these photos and watch me fall apart. They'd planned this whole thing to trap me. I kept my face blank as I pushed the phone back to her, refusing to show any reaction. "Sarah is quite charming, isn't she? She got Mr. Thompson's attention so easily," Caroline said with fake concern, clearly enjoying what she thought was my pain. "What do you have to offer compared to her?" She raised an eyebrow and went on: "When Philip was your husband. Sarah took him without trying. Even your son calls Sarah 'mom'now."She paused, watching me closely for signs of hurt. "And now you finally found a good boyfriend... but he's attracted to Sarah too."

I saw the joy she barely hid at thinking she was hurting me, but I felt strangely calm. I ran my fingers along the desk edge and took a deep breath, deciding to fight back instead of defending myself.

I kept my cool and even smiled slightly. "Is that so?" I said casually while playing with my pen. "Well, if she's got Howard's attention now..."

I deliberately set down my pen and picked up my phone, scrolling through my contacts with an almost theatrical flourish until I reached the blocked numbers. "Perhaps I should call Philip?" My voice carried a hint of sarcasm. "With Howard as her new supporter, Sarah probably doesn't need Philip's money anymore, right?"

Caroline's face changed instantly from smug to horrified. Her eyes went wide,her mouth dropped open, and all color drained from her face.

"That's between them!" she yelled, lunging for my phone and almost knocking over my coffee. "You can't interfere!"

I leaned back easily, avoiding her grabbing hands. "Your reaction is interesting, Caroline." I put my phone down and folded my hands."It shows that Howard and Sarah aren't actually involved. If they were,Sarah would have already told Philip herself,right?" Caroline tried to catch her breath and straighten her clothes. Her eyes wouldn't meet mine. "How did you know?" she whispered. "From the moment you showed me the photos," I answered honestly,gently swiveling in my chair. "Your plan was too obvious-you wanted to anger me, to make me suspicious of Howard, correct?" I stopped turning and faced her directly. "Did you and Sarah really think I'd be so easily manipulated?"

I stood up and walked to the window with my back to her. "You expected me to see these photos, get upset, and accuse Howard of cheating." I turned around to face her. "He's logical and would get tired of my accusations. Eventually we'd start fighting,and our relationship would fall apart."

I crossed my arms and watched her fidget. "Then Sarah could make her move. That's what you two planned, right?"

Caroline's fingers twisted together, her gaze flickering. Suddenly, as if finding renewed courage, she lifted her chin: "You're just making excuses!"Her voice rose. "Even if I showed you a video of them kissing, you wouldn't believe it. Because Howard is the best man you could find, and you're desperate to keep him. Even if he cheats, you'll pretend not to see it."

Her words struck a nerve, poking at old wounds. I forced mnyself to breathe deeply, then slowly walked back to my desk, tapping my fingers lightly on its surface. "If you want me to believe you, it's simple," I said calmly. "Repeat what you just told me in front of Howard."

Carolíne's eyes widened as if she'd been doused with cold water: "You want me to offend Howard?" Her voice was nearly a shriek. "According to you, he's now infatuated with Sarah," I said methodically,organizing the papers on my desk, my tone as casual as if discussing the weather. "If you help him get rid of a clingy woman who refuses to leave-meaning me-he should be pleased, shouldn't he?" I looked up, meeting her gaze. "If you don't dare, it only proves I'm right."Caroline stood there, visibly caught in a dilemma. Her fingers fidgeted incessantly, and her hem was crumpled from her nervous handling. If she did as I suggested, she would likely lose her job; if she refused, her scheme would obviously fail. I could see the thoughts tumbling through her mind, emotions flashing across her face-annoyance, embarrassment.calculation, and finally, compromise.

After weighing her options, she chose a dramatic exit. She took a deep breath, feigning indignation: "I was only trying to help you,and you don't believe me." She raised her voice, her tone exaggerated, like performing a one-woman show. "Fine! When they officially announce their relationship,don't come crying to me!"

With that, she straightened her posture, turned around haughtily, and left,her high heels clicking sharply against the floor. She slammed the door,leaving a suffocating cloud of perfume swirling in my office.

After she left, I let out a long breath and dropped the fake smile. I fell back into my chair and rubbed my temples. Acting calm in front of Caroline took effort, and Sarah's constant attacks on my relationship were wearing me down. This wasn't just random drama-it was a planned attack.


I picked up my phone and found Howard's number, my thumb hovering over it. His meeting mattered more than this petty scheme: Besides, I trusted him. I didn't need to bother him with every little problem.

Trust. The word made me smile sadly. It was the hardest lesson from my marriage to Philip.

I returned to my sketches, my pencil making a few lines on the paper,but I found my concentration had been broken. Despite my efforts to stay calm,
Caroline's words had triggered certain memories-my marriage to Philip,how completely I had trusted him, and how he and Sarah had betrayed me together.

I put down my pencil and covered my eyes, taking a deep breath. Howard wasn't Philip. They were nothing alike. I knew that. But old wounds still hurt sometimes when you least expect it.I got up and opened the window, letting the cool fall air hit my face.I looked at the busy streets and tall buildings below. The city view always helped me calm down.

No. I wouldn't let Sarah and Caroline's tricks damage what Howard and I had built.

I had a book to finish and a life to build. No one's games would distract me from that.
###Chapter 94: What Are You Planning?

Annie's POV

I saved the final illustration for my children's book and closed my tablet.My fingers were stiff from hours of detailed work, but finishing the project gave me a sense of accomplishment.

The peaceful moment ended when my office door burst open. Catherine Morgan stumbled in, her makeup smeared by tears, her designer blouse wrinkled.

"Annie!" she wailed, dropping into the chair across from my desk. "This is absolutely unbearable!"

I set my tablet aside. "What happened?"

"Your boyfriend happened!" Catherine dabbed at her eyes with a crumpled tissue. "Do you know where he sent me? That new gaming project team!"

I kept my expression neutral, though I had a good idea what was going on."I heard about your new assignment. How's it going?"

"How's it going?" Catherine's voice rose an octave. "I've been there for hours without even being able to use the bathroom! Two hours, Annie!The project manager watches us like a hawk. I had to make up an emergency just to escape for a few minutes!"

She leaned forward, eyes wild with frustration. "The workload is insane.The deadlines are impossible. And the worst part? Howard did this on purpose! He set a trap, and Molly and I walked right into it!"

I reached across the desk and patted her hand. "You've been working really hard. I'm sorry it's been difficult."

"He's terrifying," Catherine whispered, glancing nervously at the door. "I never thought he'd go this far just because of a little prank."

"A prank?" I asked, though I'd already guessed about the spicy food incident Howard had mentioned.

Catherine waved her hand dismissively. "Just a silly joke. Nothing worth mentioning." She quickly changed the subject. "The point is, this new position is killing me!"

I studied her carefully. "Despite the difficulties, have you learned anything useful?"

Catherine paused, caught off guard by my question. "Well... I guess I have picked up some new skills. The project lead is actually brilliant-when he's not driving us insane with deadlines. And the technical aspects are interesting..." Her voice trailed off.

"But?" I prompted.

"But it's exhausting!" she exclaimed, throwing her hands up. "I didn't sign up for this kind of pressure! I want my comfortable job in marketing back.All I did there was coordinate events and manage social media. It was easy."

"I thought you were planning to take over your father's company someday,"I reminded her. "The Morgan family business is substantial. Won't these management skills come in handy?" Catherine sighed and slumped in her chair. "I was thinking... maybe I could just find a husband willing to marry into the family and let him run Dad's company. Then I could keep working here, doing something simple." I couldn't help but laugh at her naivety. "Catherine, that's a dangerous plan. If you hand over control to someone else, what's to stop them from taking everything and leaving you with nothing? Your father built that company with hard work, not by finding someone else to do the difficult parts."

She frowned, clearly not having considered this perspective before."But learning all this technical stuff is so hard..." Her complaint sounded childish even to her own ears, and she winced.

"The things worth having rarely come easily," I said. "If you want to be respected as more than just 'Morgan's daughter,' you need to develop real professional skills."

Catherine looked at me for a long moment, then grudgingly nodded. "I guess you're right. It's just... nobody ever pushed me this hard before."

A sharp knock interrupted us. The gaming department's project manager-a stern man with thick glasses-poked his head in.

"Miss Morgan, your fifteen-minute break ended thirty minutes ago," he said,checking his watch. "We have a milestone to hit by six."

Catherine shot me a desperate look, silently pleading for rescue, but I just gave her an encouraging smile. With a dramatic sigh, she stood and smoothed her wrinkled blouse.

"Coming," she said reluctantly. As she trudged toward the door,she glanced back at me. "This conversation isn't over."

As Catherine left, I noticed Howard standing in the doorway. The subtle smile on his lips told me he'd heard at least part of our conversation. He stepped into my office,closing the door behind him.

"I'm back," he said, walking over to kiss my forehead. "I missed you."

I stood and hugged him, breathing in his familiar scent. "I missed you too,"I admitted, surprised by how mnuch I meant it.

As I held him, I couldn't help comparing him to Philip. My ex-husband rarely expressed missing me during the day. Had he ever truly loved me?I doubted it now. Howard never hesitated to show his feelings. There was something reassuring about a man who wasn't afraid to be vunerable.

"Sit down," I suggested, pointing to the sofa in the corner. "You look tired.How was your meeting?"

Howard studied my face carefully. "Something's different about your tone.What happened while I was gone?"

I took a deep breath, deciding to be direct. "Someone showed me photos of you and Sarah Johnson talking in your car today."

His expression darkened immediately. "Let me guess-Caroline Gluck?"

I nodded. "She claimed you didn't love me anymore, thatyou were developing feelings for Sarah instead." I kept my voice steady, meeting his eyes.

Howard's jaw tightened. He reached for my hand. "This was Sarah's plan all along. She approached me in the parking garage, insisting she had important information about you. She claimed you were hiding something from me."

"And you let her into your car to hear what she had to say?" I asked,curious rather than accusatory.

"I wanted to know what lies she would make up," Howard answered calmly. "I've been expecting her next move since she started harassing you online."

"What did she tell you?" I was genuinely curious about what new story Sarah had coneocted.

Howard's grip on my hand tightened slightly. "She claimed your fall down the stairs wasn't what caused your miscarriage." His voice was carefully controlled. "She said you had an... inappropriate relationship with her ex-husband, Robert. And that was the real reason you lost the baby."

I felt cold at his words. Of all the lies Sarah could have chosen, this one cut closest to a painful truth-though not in the way she'd implied.

Howard continued, his eyes never leaving mine. "Of course I know what exactly happened. And I want you to know that I trust you completely."

His unwavering faith in me warmed my heart. After years with Philip,who questioned me at every turn, Howard's trust felt like a precious gift.

"Thank you," I whispered, squeezing his hand. "That means more than you know."

"You called me that day, remember? When you were in danger?"

The memory rushed back-the desperate phone call I'd made to Howard after waking up in Robert's apartment, drugged and disoriented. I'd barely known Howard then, just enough to have his number, but he had been the only person I could think to call.

"You called me for help," Howard continued, his voice gentle but his eyes sharp with anger. "I sent people to investigate immediately.I know everything-how Phílip and Sarah drugged your drink at the charity event,how Robert took you to his apartment while you were unconscious, how you managed to escape by appealing to his wounded pride and sense of competition with Philip."

I felt exposed yet strangely secure. Howard knew more about my darkest moments than I'd realized. But instead of judgment, all I saw in his eyes was admiration and protectiveness.

"You were incredibly brave that night," he said, touching my cheek. "It's one of the many reasons I admire you, Annie." For a moment, I glimpsed something dangerous in Howard's eyes-a cold,calculating look that reminded me he wasn't just the gentle man who held me at night. He was also a powerful businessman who eliminated obstacles without mercy. I had little doubt that he'd already planned some form of punishment for Philip and Sarah.

"I can't believe Sarah dared to bring this up to you directly," I said,shaking my head.

Howard's lip curled slightly. "She thought she could manipulate me.I made it clear I knew the truth. I told her I was the one who took you to the emergency room after your fall. I said if a baby could survive such a fall, it would be a miracle." His voice turned ice-cold. "Then I suggested she try falling down the stairs herself to test her theory."

I looked up sharply at that. "Howard..."

"I didn't push her," he clarified quickly. "I merely pointed out how absurd her claim was."

I nodded slowly, thinking. "Still, her baby muast be protected."

Howard looked at me with genuine confusion. "Why? After what she did to you-after she indirectly caused the death of your child-why would you care about hers?"

"Don't you want revenge for your lost child?" he asked, his voice soft but intense.

I met his gaze steadily, my voice calm and certain. "It's precisely because I want revenge for my child..."

I let the sentence hang unfinished, a small smile playing at my lips.Howard studied me for a long moment, his expression changing from confusion to dawning realization, then to admiration mixed'with concern. "Annie," he said slowly, "what are you planning?"
###Chapter 95: A New Relationship

Annie's POV

The silence in the office was comfortable, a stark contrast to the chaotic energy Catherine had brought in earlier. I leaned back in my chair, stretching my stiff fingers, when the door opened again. This time, it was Howard.

The way he looked at me—with such unwavering focus—always made my heart flutter. He didn't say a word at first, just walked over and stood by my desk. The air between us felt charged, not with the tension of work, but with a deep, magnetic connection that had been growing for weeks.

"You've been working too hard," he said softly, his voice a low rumble that seemed to vibrate in the quiet room.

"I wanted to finish the project," I replied, looking up at him.

He reached out, his hand gently covering mine on the desk. The warmth of his touch was grounding. In that moment, the barriers I had spent years building around my heart felt like they were finally dissolving. He pulled me up from my chair, and for a heartbeat, we just stood there, centimeters apart, lost in each other’s gaze.

Howard drew me into his arms, a firm and protective embrace that made me feel like I had finally found my harbor. When he kissed me, it was a revelation—a blend of deep affection and a promise of a future where I wouldn't have to fight my battles alone.

I leaned into him, my hands resting on his chest, feeling the steady beat of his heart. It was a rhythm I wanted to get used to. As he held me, I realized that this wasn't just a rebound or a fleeting spark. This was a new beginning, a relationship built on mutual respect and a love that was as steady as it was intense. We weren't just two people anymore; we were becoming a team.
###Chapter 96:I Believe Her

Brian's POV

I trudged up the steps to Grandma Ruth's Brooklyn apartment building.dragging my feet with each step. For the past several weekends, I'd spy on Mom and Howard's house, watching their perfect life from a distance.But today was different. I'd promised Grandma I would visit her instead.

The building was old but well-maintained. As I reached Grandma's floor,I saw her already waiting in the doorway. Her gray-streaked hair was pulled back in a simple bun, and her eyes lit up when she spotted me.

"Brian!" she called, hurrying toward me with open arms.

I let her hug me, feeling strangely small in her embrace. She smelled like lavender, just like Mom used to before everything changed. The familiar scent made my throat tighten.

She pulled back to study my face, her hands gentle on my shoulders. The way she tilted her head slightly to the side as she examined me was exactly how Mom would look when checking if I had a fever.

"These days, you've been suffering, haven't you?" she asked, her voice soft and concerned. The question caught me off guard. Nobody had asked how I felt in what seemed like forever. Dad was too busy with Sarah, Sarah was too busy pretending to be nice when Dad was around, and Mom... Mom wasn't around at all. "I'm okay," I started to say automatically, but something broke inside me.My chin trembled, and before I could stop them, tears were streaming down my face. "Grandma, it's all Dad's fault!"I choked out, my voice breaking. "Why did he have to cheat? Why did he make me spend time with Sarah? Why did he tell me all those bad things about Mom and make Sarah sound so perfect?"

I wiped furiously at my eyes, embarrassed by my outburst but unable to stop. "I'm just a kid! What did I know? If he hadn't done all that, Mom and I would still be happy together. I hate him!"

Grandma Ruth quickly pulled me into another hug, her hand gently stroking my hair as she guided me inside her apartment. "Shhh, let it all out," she whispered, closing the door behind us.

She helped me wipe away my tears with her soft handkerchief. "He's certainly no prize," she agreed with a hint of bitterness. "But I can see my Brian has recognized his mistakes. You're a good boy who knows when he's wrong."

I couldn't stop crying. The tears kept coming, months of bottled-up feelings pouring out all at once. "But it's too late, Grandma. Mom doesn't want me anymore."

"Your mother..." Ruth began, her tone serious.

I panicked, not wanting to hear my grandmother criticize Mom. It wasn't fair-Mom wasn't the one who did anything wrong.

"It's not her fauIt!" I interrupted quickly. "I was so horrible to her. Before all this happened, she was the best mom ever. She was always there for me."


Ruth's eyes softened as she looked at me, with that same determined glint I'd seen in Mom's eyes when she was thinking deeply about something,"Your mother loved you and your father deeply. She gave everything for both of you. But you and your father betrayed her."

Her words stung, but I knew they were true. I remembered how I'dscreamed at Mom that I hated her, how I'd told her Sarah was better.The memory made me feel sick.

"I know she might need time," Ruth continued,her voice gentler now. "So,where are you living these days? With Philip and Sarah?"

I let out a bitter laugh. "No. After they got married, Sarah stopped pretending to care about me. Whenever Dad isn't home, she's awful to me.And Dad sometimes takes her side... he letsher be mean to me."

Ruth's eyes widened in shock.

-"I moved to Grandma Betty's housefor a while," I continued, trying to sound casual. "But she cares more about Sarah's baby than about me. So I moved out and live by myself now."

"Philip let you move out? A child your age?" Ruth's voice had risen in disbelief. "Has he lost his mind? Abandoning his own son for that woman?
I believe he does support you financially?"

I shrugged, trying to act like it didn't hurt. "No, but it's okay."

Ruth grabbed my hand and started leading me toward her bedroom."Grandma has money. I'll give you some."

"No!" I pulled my hand away. "Mom helped me save a lot of money before the divorce. As long as I don't waste it, I'll be fine for a long time."

Ruth's expression softened with pride. "Your mother always thinks ahead.She plans for everything. That's one of her best qualities."I nodded in agreement, feeling a pang in my chest at the mention of Mom's thoughtfulness. She had always protected me, even when planning for a future where she might not be with me. "But it's not safe for a child to live alone," Ruth continued, her forehead creased with worry in the exact same way Mom's would whenever I climbed too high on the playground.

"I'm not completely alone," I assured her. "Mitchell, our driver, and Ms.Taylor, mny tutor, live with me. They're really nice to me."

Ruth still looked concerned. "Would you like me to move in with you? To keep you company?"

The offer surprised me. "You would do that?" I asked, feeling a rush of hope. Living alone had seemed brave at first, but the nights were long and lonely. Having someone who actually cared about me in the same house would make everything better.

Ruth tapped my forehead gently with her finger, another gesture so like Mom's that I felt a lumpforming in my throat. "Of course I would."

"That would be awesome!" I couldn't help jumping up and down with excitement.

Ruth watched me, her smile tinged with sadness. "What if I talk to your mother? Maybe she could come see you, and you could talk things out?"

My excitement vanished instantly. "No, don't do that," I said quickly. "I don't want to make things harder for her."

The truth was, I wasn't ready to face Mom yet. Not after everything I'd done. As evening fell, Ruth busied herself in the kitchen, preparing what she called a "proper dinner" for me. The small apartment filled with delicious smells that reminded me of holidays and special occasions from before everything fell apart. She moved around the kitchen with the same efficient grace as Mom, never wasting a single motion. "So, how are things at school?" she asked casually as she set a plate piled high with food in front of me. "Are you still friends with that boy you used to mention... Max, was it?"

I bit my lip, not meeting her eyes. "Max isn't my friend anymore,"I admitted after a moment. "After Sarah started being mean to me,Max changed too. He told everyone in class that I'm 'unwanted' because even my own mother doesn't love me anymore."

Ruth's hand froze in midair, her expression darkening. "That child sounds terrible."

I shrugged, pushing food around my plate. "It's okay, Grandma. I have new friends at school now." I hesitated before adding, "And Lucy is nice to me."

"Lucy?" Ruth raised an eyebrow. "Who's that, dear?"

"She's a little girl who lives with Mom now," I explained. "Her name is Lucy Thompson. She's Mr. Howard Thompson's niece. He's taking care of her because her parents died. Mom is dating him now."

Ruth's eyes widened slightly. "Oh? Tell me more about your mother's...situation."

I took a sip of water, gathering my thoughts. "Mom works at Howard's company now. She makes children's books-she's really good at it.Howard is super rich and owns this huge company. He's really tall and serious-looking, but he's actually nice," As I talked about Mom's new life, I found myself sharing more details than I'd planned. "They live in this beautiful house with a huge yard.Lucy has her own playground and everything." "And this Lucy," Ruth prompted gently. "What's she like?" I couldn't help smiling now. "She doesn't talk much-she has somethingcalled selective mutism because of what happened to her parents. But she always shares her snacks with me at school. One time when Max tried to push her, I shoved him and pulled her away."

Ruth looked intrigued. "That's kind of you."

My smile grew wider. "And she thanked me."

Suddenly, a thought struck me, and my expression turned serious."
Grandma, if Mom marries Howard, Lucy would become my sister,right?"

Ruth nearly dropped her fork. "Well, technically yes,but-”

"I want that to happen," I interrupted, my voice stronger than it had been all day. "I want Mom to be happy. I want Lucy to be my sister. I just don't know how to tell Mom I'm sorry."

Tears threatened to spill over again. "I said so many mean things to her.I did so many hurtful things. She'll never forgive me."

Ruth reached across the table and squeezed my hand. "Don't say that,
child. Your mother loves you more than anything in this world. Give her
some time,give yourself some time. Everything will work out."

I believe her.
###Chapter 97: The Jade Gift

Annie's POV

The moon hung high outside the window, casting a silver glow over the room. I looked at the jade pendant in my hand, its cool surface a stark contrast to the warmth radiating from Howard as he stood close behind me.

"Do you like it?" his deep voice vibrated through the small space between us.

I turned around, meeting his gaze. "It's beautiful, Howard. But it's too much. I can't possibly accept something this valuable."

"It’s not about the value," he said, stepping closer until I could feel the steady rhythm of his presence. He reached out, his fingers brushing against the jade as he helped me put it on. His touch was light, yet it sent a wave of calm through me, a feeling of being truly protected.

I looked up at him, my breath hitching as I saw the intensity in his eyes. There was a raw, unspoken promise there—a commitment that went far beyond words. In that moment, the rest of the world vanished. There was no more office politics, no more shadows of the past, just the two of us in this quiet, sacred space.

Howard’s hand moved from the pendant to cup my face, his thumb grazing my cheek with a tenderness that made my heart swell. "Annie," he whispered, his voice thick with emotion. "You are more precious to me than any gem."

He leaned in, and our foreheads rested against each other. The air was charged with an undeniable connection, a profound bond built on trust and shared trials. When he finally kissed me, it wasn't just a gesture of desire; it was a seal of a new beginning.

He held me close, his arms wrapping around me like a fortress. I leaned into him, closing my eyes and simply feeling the strength of his embrace. We stood there for a long time, anchored by each other, knowing that whatever challenges lay ahead, we would face them as one. This wasn't just a fleeting moment; it was the foundation of our future.
###Chapter 98: My Last Chance at Being a Father
Philip's POV

I sat in my car, staring up at the balcony of Howard Thompson's mansion.Annie and Howard stood there together, holding hands as they looked at the night sky. They weren't kissing like the other night, but this simple moment seemed more intimate,more real.

I checked my watch - almost midnight. Two hours wasted watching someone else's lie instead of living my own.

Annie had changed. Before, she would desperately explain herself whenever I accused her of something. Now? She'd blocked my number.Howard stood between us like a wall I couldn't break through.

My knuckles turned white as I gripped the steering wheel. Annie finally had someone to protect her. The thought made my chest ache.

Howard put his arm around Annie's waist, and she smiled - a real smile I rarely saw during our marriage. A smile I never caused.

Why did I still attack Annie every time Sarah complained about her? Why couldn't I stop myself?

Had I always treated Annie this way? Made her feel accused, unheard,unprotected?


No wonder Howard said she'd never choose me again. Who would return to someone who hurt them so consistently?

I had everything a man could want - wealth, success, a child on the way.Yet here I was, hiding in the dark, watching my ex-wife like some pathetic stalker. Tears ran down my face. I knew I should leave her alone. If I truly loved her, I'd want her happiness, even without me.

But I couldn't stop coming here night after night. These brief glimpses of Annie were all I had left.

I wiped my tears away, disgusted with myself. Philip Baker crying over a woman who'd moved on. What had I become?

My phone rang. Sarah's name on the screen. I answered, already regretting it.


"Hello?"

"Annie encouraged people to cyberbully me..." Sarah's voice was controlled,calculated. "Didn't you stand up for me earlier? After you hung up,you never contacted me again. I want to know what happened."

"Do I look like an idiot to you?" I snapped, gripping the phone tightly.

"Is it because I've been treating you decently lately? You think that means I still love you? That you can manipulate me however you want?"

"Philip, I don't understand what you mean..." Sarah sounded confused,which only made me angrier.

"You understand perfectly," I said. "You started trouble with Annie online.When she defended herself, people criticized you. Then you told me Annie was cyberbullying you!"

I hit the dashboard with my free hand. "I believed you and confronted Annie! And what happened? I looked like a fool when I learned the truth!All because you lied to me!"

"Sarah, I won't believe a single word you say from now on."

Silence. I could practically hear her calculating her next move. "I'm sorry..." she finally said, her voice softening. "Being pregnant and criticized online made me emotional. If you don't like it, I'll change next time!"


"Really?" I couldn't hide my disbelief.

Suddenly, Sarah's tone changed completely. "Oh! Philip, come quickly! My stomach hurts terribly!"

Her voice rose in panic. "What if I'm miscarrying?"

Despite my anger seconds before, fear took over. I'd aIready lost Brian.This baby was my last chance at family.

"Don't worry, I'm coming right away!" I started the car.

"Okay," Sarah whispered.

I looked at the balcony one last time as I pulled away. Howard and Annie had gone inside, their peace undisturbed by my presence.

As I drove to Sarah's apartment, I cursed myself. Hadn't I just promised not to believe her lies? Yet here I was, rushing to her at the first mention of danger to the baby.


What is wrong with me? I ran a red light. At work, I made decisions based on data and logic. With women, I became completely irrational.

I found Sarah lying on her apartment floor,face pale.

"How are you feeling?" I knelt beside her.

"Not good," she whispered. "Take me to the hospital."

I remembered Annie after her fall - how I wasn't there, how I failed her.I couldn't make that mistake again. "It's going to be okay. I'm here," I lifted her carefully.

Sarah wrapped her arms around my neck, her head against my shoulder.
As I carried her to the car, I felt both worried and suspicious. Was this another trick? I couldn't risk it - not with my child's life at stake.

"T'll drive fast, but safely," I placed her in the passenger seat. "We'll get there in time."


Sarah smiled weakly. "I trust you."

I sped through empty streets, running yellow lights. We reached the hospital in minutes, and I carried Sarah straight to the emergency room.

"My wife is pregnant and having severe abdominal pain," I told the nurse,the word "wife" slipping out by habit. "She needs immediate attention."

The staff took Sarah for examination while I paced the waiting room,imagining the worst.

What if she loses the baby? I can't lose another child.

The hospital smell brought back memories of Annie's miscarriage - my absence, my failure. I checked my watch repeatedly, growing more anxious by the minute.

This time will be different. This time I'll do everything right.

The doctor finally approached me.

"There's nothing to worry about," he said. "Both mother and baby are perfectly healthy."

Relief flooded through me. "Thank you,doctor."

I helped Sarah to a seat, keeping my voice gentle. "We're fine. Nothing's wrong." She stroked her belly, smiling. "That's wonderful. I don't know how I would have faced you if something had happened."

"Don't talk like that," I said, genuinely relieved the child was safe.

Sarah's expression changed. "Actually, I think this is Annie's fault."

"If she hadn't responded to me online," Sarah said softly, "people wouldn't have attacked me. My stomach wouldn't have hurt... and you wouldn't have had to rush here so late."


She grabbed my sleeve. "Could you contact Anne and talk to her about this? I am pregnant. She should be more considerate. For the baby's sake!"

"Absolutely not! That's ridiculous!" I pulled my arm away. "If you want to avoid conflict with her, stop provoking her!"

"I can't do that!" Sarah's eyes filled with tears. "I love you, but you love her! Every time I see her doing well, I feel so jealous!"

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "I always wonder if I need to be as good as she is to deserve your love. But I can't be like her. So I try to bring her down... to make it seem like we're not so different. It helps me cope."

She started crying. "If you ask me to stop, I'll suffocate. Philip, please,for the baby's sake... help me."

I saw exactly what was happening. Sarah was using our unborn child to manipulate me into hurting Annie again. The thought made my stomach turn.


But what if she was right about stress affecting the baby? What if my refusal caused complications? Could I live with that?

I looked at Sarah's pregnant belly. I thought of Brian, who barely spoke to me anymore. I thought of the child Annie and I lost. How many more chances would I get to be a father?

I gave in. I borrowed a phone from someone nearby and called Annie.

"Who is this?" Annie sounded suspicious.

"It's Philip." I spoke quickly. "Please don't hang up. I have something important to tell you."

"What do you want?" Her impatience was obvious.

"When Sarah mentions you online, could you not respond?" I hated myself with each word. "Your response today got her criticized. It affected her baby... she almost miscarried."


As I spoke, shame washed over me. I was letting Sarah manipulate me into attacking Annie again. I was becoming the villain in Annie's life once more.


But my fear of losing another child overpowered everything else.I had failed Brian. I had failed Annie. This baby was my last chance at being a father.


I waited for Annie's response, my heart poundling. How had I sunk this low? When had I become a man who would hurt someone he claimed to love for a woman he didn't even trust?


The silence stretched on, a perfect judgment for what I had become. 
###Chapter 99: Persistent Philip

Annie's POV

The night breeze caressed my skin as I leaned against the balcony railing,gazing at the distant lights of New York City with a newfound softness in my eyes. Today's events-from Catherine's dramatic complaints about her new work assignment to the touching gift from Lucy's grandparents-though complicated, left me feeling unusually content.

Howard stood beside me, his tall frame blocking the cool wind. He turned to face me, and in the moonlight, his usually serious face had softened.

"Lucy's grandparents seem to like you," he observed, studying my profile.

I smiled, shaking my head gently. "They're just transferring their feelings for their daughter. Because I take care of Lucy."

Howard's gaze lingered on me, his eyes filled with unmistakable admiration. "No, it's more than that."

I reached out to lightly touch his face. "But you're different. You genuinely love me."


"Yes," Howard admitted without hesitation. "The first time I'saw you was at the hospital. Lucy pointed at you and said you were Brian's mom."

His voice grew softer, more intimate. "You looked so vulnerable then, yet gentle and beautiful at the same time."


Howard found my hand, his thumb tracing circles in my palm. "The next time I saw you was when you fell down the stairs and lost your baby."

His expression momentarily darkened. "You were lying in a pool of blood.your face pale. That's when I realized how much suffering you'd endured,how terribly you'd been treated." He pulled me closer, his warmth enveloping me. "As we spent more time together. I gradually discovered the real you-independent, resilient, with clear goals and dreams."

His gaze met mine, intense and sincere. "Before I realized what was happening, I was drawn to you. By the time I became aware of it,I had fallen deeply in love with you."

Howard didn't seem to expect an immediate response. Instead, he cupped my face in his hands and leaned down to kiss me. I closed my eyes,losing myself in the gentle pressure of his lips on mine.

This peaceful moment was interrupted by my phone ringing. I reluctantly moved away from Howard to check the caller ID-an unknown number.My instincts told me I should answer.

"Hello?" I asked cautiously.

"Annie, it's Philip." His voice immediately made me tense. "Please don't hang up. I have something important to tell you."

My body stiffened, fingers tightening around the phone. "What do you want?"


Howard noticed the change in my demeanor, his brow furrowing with concern. I put the phone on speaker so he could hear too.


"When Sarah mentions you online, could you not respond?" Philip's voice sounded tense, almost desperate. "Your response today got her criticized.It affected her baby... she almost miscarried."


The same ridiculous logic again. Sarah publicly attacks me online, I simply clarify the facts, and I'm asked to be silent? Because "she's pregnant"? As if pregnancy is some kind of immunity card that allows you to hurt others without consequences. I listened with increasing disbelief to Philip's absurd request. After everything Sarah had done to me-after the child I lost because of her-he was asking me to silently accept her harassment?


Is he really that naive? Or has his intelligence completely failed him? A grown man, CEO of a Wall Street investment firm, making such a childish request. Does he truly believe the world revolves around Sarah because she's carrying a child? This kind of thinking that ignores right and wrong is suffocating. Philip has always been like this, only seeing what he wants to see, interpreting everything in the most self-serving way possible.

"Philip, do you hear yourself?" I asked coldly. "Do you realize how absurd you sound?"

"Please, Annie. For her child's sake-"

"You dare," I interrupted, my voice sharp. "From the beginning, this entire situation,I have been the victim. And now, just because she claims her child might be affected, I should let her spread lies about me?"

Philip's voice turned defensive. "She's pregnant!"

"And that gives her the right to harass me online? Damage my reputation?"My voice rose as years of suppressed anger surfaced. "Philip, let me ask you something-is that child mine?"

There was a pause before he reluctantly answered, "No."

"Then I have no obligation to tolerate her behavior," I said firmly. "I know better than anyone that she's using this child to keep you close.She would never let anything happen to it."

I took a deep breath, calming myself. "Tell your girlfriend to stay away from me. Because next time, my response won't just be clarifying facts."

Without waiting for his reply, I ended the call and immediately blocked the number. My hand trembled slightly as I put down the phone.

Howard took my hand, his touch reassuring. "That was Philip?"

"Yes," I nnodded, taking deep breaths to calm myself. "He borrowed someone else's phone to call me because I've blocked his number."

Howard's lips twisted into a contemptuous smile. "He really goes to great lengths to defend Sarah."


Before he could say more, his own phone rang. He glanced at the screen.raising an eyebrow in surprise.

"Speak of the devil," he murmured, showing me Philip's name on the screen.

Howard answered with professionally cold couresy,"Mr. Baker, what can I do for you?"

Philip's voice came clearly through the night air. "Can you limit the resources provided to Annie? Perhaps reduce her promotion opportunities?"


Howard's face remained impressively neutral, though I could see anger flickering in his eyes. "The affairs of my company are none of your business,Mr.Baker."

"But if Annie didn't have so many followers, Sarah wouldn't be attacked online," Philip insisted, his reasoning both desperate and flawed.

Howard's patience was visibly waning. "If Sarah hadn't provoked Annie in the first place, none of this would have happened. Don't you think that's the real issue here?"


"I'm just asking for your help," Philip's voice took on a pleading quality I'd rarely heard during our marriage. "For Sarah's child." Howard's tone turned icy. "I suggest you find the real problem instead of asking the victim to make further concessions."

There was silence on the other end for a moment before Philip spoke again.his voice low. "I understand Annie is the injured party here. But I'm desperate, Howard. Sarah is using the child to manipulate me, I know that.But what if her claim about stress affecting the baby isn't a lie? What if my refusal causes complications?"

There was a note ofvulnerability in his voice. "I've already lost Brian-he barely speaks to me anymore. I lost Annie and the child we should have had. This might be my last chance at being a father."

Howard's expression softened slightly, though his voice remained firm."
Then perhaps you should focus first on being a better father to Brian,
rather than enabling Sarah's behavior."

"It's not that simple," Philip sighed. "Nothing is simple anymore."

"I can't help you with this problem, Philip," Howard finally said. "Annie has been through enough because of you and Sarah. I won't let you victimize her again."

After the call ended, Howard pulled me close, his arms wrapping protectively around me.

"He's a mess," I whispered against Howard's chest.

Howard nodded, his chin resting on top of my head. "He made his choices.Now he has to live with them."

We stood in silence for a while, watching as stars appeared one by one in the night sky. Despite these interruptions, a sense of peace still enveloped me. For the first time in years, I felt truly protected,truly valued.

"You handled Philip so calmly just now.,." Howard began,a note of admiration in his voice. "You've changed."

I smiled at him. "I've learned that sometimes the most powerful response is simply refusing to engage."

"You always had that strength," Howard replied, tucking a strand of hair behind my ear. "You just needed to discover it."

"It's getting late," I said softly, glancing at my watch. "I should check on Lucy, make sure she's sleeping well."

Howard nodded, pressing a light kiss to my forehead. "Go ahead. I'll stay out here a little longer."


I took one last look at the quiet New York skyline below, wondering if just a short while ago, Philip had been somewhere down there,watching us.I was no longer the Annie Baker who could be pushed around, and that change was profound and irreversible.
###Chapter 100: Howard Thompson, Your Luck Won't Hold Forever.
Sarah's POV

I sat on the sofa, my eyes fixed on Philip as he stood in the hospital hallway making his call. He'd borrowed someone's phone, so I couldn't hear Annie's side of the conversation. A flutter of anxiety mixed with anticipation rose in my chest. I knew Philip would stand up for me. After all, this baby was my trump card-the mere mention of it was enough to make him obey.


I studied his profile, noting how his brow furrowed deeper by the second,his expression growing increasingly troubled. A twinge of unease rippled through me. Had Annie refused him again? Why couldn't that woman just quietly accept my taunts? The thought irritated me, but I knew better than to let it show on my face.


Philip ended the call and walked back into the room in silence. I immediately switched to my concerned expression, eyes widened with practiced vulnerability.

"How did it go? Did Annie agree to back off?" I asked softly, making my voice sound small and hopeful.

"As you wanted, I got chewed out. And no, Annie didn't agree to anything." Philip replied, frustration evident in every syllable.


Hearing his response sent a wave of satisfaction through me. Annie may not have yielded, but Philip had been scolded-exactly what I'd hoped for.Every time he defended me and suffered for it, he became more dependent on me, more in need of my comfort and validation. I felt that delicious sense of control, the corners of my mouth lifting involuntarily.

I suddenly realized I was smiling and quickly tried to compose my
features, but it was too late. Philip had noticed.

Something shifted in his gaze, a flicker of suspicion that made my heart race. I couldn't let him see through me.


"I'm so sorry," I quickly grabbed his hand, adding a deliberáte tremor to my voice. "I only asked for your help because I have no other man to rely on."


I paused, allowing my eyes to moisten slightly as I looked up at him."I had no idea Annie would be so cruel to you just because you tried to help me."


I watched Philip's expression carefully,noting how his anger seemed to subside somewhat, but he pulled his hand away sooner than expected.Inwardly, I felt a flash of annoyance. Why was this man becoming increasingly difficult to manipulate?

"Hmm." Philip's response was curt, his eyes no longer meeting mine.I could sense his eagerness to leave.

This wasn't a good sign. I had expected him to double down on supporting me after Annie's rejection, as he usually did. Instead,he seemed to be distancing himself. My mind began calculating my next move,though I maintained my fragile demeanor outwardly.

Philip stood up. "It's late, and I have work tomorrow. I should get going."

I quickly assessed the situation-trying to make him stay might backfire.Since I'd already accomplished my goal of making him confront Annie,tonight's mission was essentially complete. Besides, I had more important matters to attend to.


"I won't see you out then," I said softly, already planning my  next steps for after his departure. I stood at the door, watching Philip's retreating figure, my mind already crafting ways to use this incident to getcloser to Howard. After Philip's car disappeared from view, I quickly closed the door and pulled out my phone.



This was a perfect opportunity to capture Howard's attention,perhaps even plant a seed of doubt about Annie in his mind.


I found Howard's number, took a deep breath to compose myself, and dialed. When I heard his voice, my pulse genuinely quickened-not just from nervousness, but from the effect his deep, magnetic voice had on me.

"Hello?" Howard's voice sounded calm and distant.

"It's me, Sarah Johnson." I deliberately made my voice sound soft and slightly anxious. "Mr. Thompson, did Philip just contact Annie?"

There was a pause on the other end, followed by a simple "Hmm?" This response caught me off guard; typically, men showed more concern when I displayed vulnerability. I quickly adjusted my approach.


"I didn't think he would do that," I continued, injecting a note of hurt into my voice. "I just mentioned feeling upset..."


"Who could have imagined he'd get so angry and call to complain." I added, while internally knowing this was precisely the outcome I had orchestrated. Having Philip attack Annie, then playing innocent with Howard-a win-win situation in my book.

But Howard's reaction completely blindsided me.

"You don't need to explain anything to me. I'm not interested in your affairs." His voice was as cold as ice.


His words stung. I was accustomed to men paying attention to me,defending me, considering my feelings. But Howard seemed completely immune to my tactics. I bit my lip, experiencing a mixture of genuine disappointment and feigned hurt.

"Are you saying that because you're afraid of making Annie angry?" I asked tentatively, wondering if Annie was the obstacle preventing me from getting closer to Howard.

"Not at all," Howard's rebuttal was calm and direct. "Sarah, you started this whole thing."

His subsequent words cut into my pride like a knife: "Then Annie defended herself with evidence... everyone criticized you. Logically,things should have ended there, but you couldn't accept that, so you had to find someone to fight your battles. Now you're playing innocent with me,shifting all responsibility to Philip who was just trying to help you. It's absurd."


I felt a surge of anger and humiliation. How dare he speak to me this way?Even more shocking was his next question.

"How do you think Philip would feel if he knew all his concern for you was repaid with this kind of betrayal?"

Howard's words sent a chill through me. How had he seen through me so easily? The character I'd so carefully constructed seemed completely transparent to him, I couldn't help wondering if I had underestimated this man.


My situation was suddenly precarious. Philip's support was beginning to waver, and Howard was completely unmoved by my charms. I urgently needed a new benefactor, or things would become very difficult after the baby was born.

My tone became stiff as I tried to salvage some dignity:′′Aa CEO of your stature, surely you're not petty enough to gossip about trivial matters like this?"

I was warning him, hoping he wouldn't share our conversation with Philip.If Philip learned how I spoke about him behind his back, I might lose his support entirely.

Howard responded with casual indifference: "I might mention it in passing at work."


His answer made my blood run cold. Was he threatening me? I didn't know how to respond and opted for silence.

The line went dead. Howard had hung up. I stared at my phone screen,a wave of humiliation and anger washing over me.Why wasn't Howard as easily manipulated as other men?

I refused to end things this way. I dialed Howard's number again,planning to restart the conversation with a different approach. But the call indicated he was busy. I tried several more times with the same result.

A terrible thought occurred to me-had Howard blocked my number? I opened my photo gallery, selected my most flattering selfie, and attempted to send him a message. In the photo, I was smiling, my expression a calculated blend of innocence and seduction that worked on most men.

But the message failed to send.

This tíme, anger completely overwhelmed me. I wanted to throw my phone against the wall, to scream, to release this feeling of humiliation.But I ultimately controlled myseIf. I knew I couldn't lose control, at least not now.


I took several deep breaths, forcing myself to calm down, If Howard was immune to my usual tactics, I would need to devise a new plan. I wouldn't give up-I never easily surrendered something I wanted.' I gently caressed my abdomen, a cold smile spreading across my face.I still had Philip in my grasp, this baby, and many other resources I could leverage. Howard Thompson, your luck won't hold forever.
###Chapter 101: Solving Trouble

Howard's POV

My phone vibrated in my pocket for the seventh time tonight. I didn't bother checking it. Sarah was becoming increasingly desperate, her tactics more brazen.


A cold smile tugged at my lips. It was time to end this game.

I pulled out my phone and scrolled through my contacts.Mytthumb paused over Robert Johnson's number.

Sarah's ex-husband would prove more useful than he could imagine. I pressed the call button.

He picked up on the third ring.

"Mr. Thompson?" The surprise in his voice was gratifying. "You're calling me?"

"You're starting a new business venture, but no one's willing to invest.correct?" I kept my voice calm, deliberately casual.

"Yes,but how did you-"

"They all believe you'll squander the funds. A rich boy who inherited wealth but lacks actual business acumen." I cut him off, my fingers tapping lightly against the railing.

There was a pause. "Since my family business went bankrupt... yes."His voice dropped, laden with resentment.
"I can provide full funding." I went straight to the point, seeing no reason
 

to waste time.

"What do you want in return?" His wariness was immediate.

"Do you still love Sarah?" I asked, knowing the question would strike a nerve.

Robert's silence spoke volumes. I could hear his breathing quicken on the other end of the line.

"With my financial backing, your company could be successful very quickly,
"I lowered my voice. "A successful man-Sarah would willingly return to you."

"So... what do you need me to do?" Interest had crept into his voice now.

"Create a social media account using my name. Add Sarah, engage her in conversation." My tone remained even, betraying nothing.

"Why?"

"She's been interfering in my life recently, affecting my relationship with my girlfriend." I offered enough truth to seem forthcoming,but not the complete picture.

"You want me to... pretend to be you?" Suspicion colored his words. "To what end?"

"Simply talk to her. See how she responds to what she believes is attention from me." I paused. "You'll understand once you begin."
"I don't know about this..."

"Consider it carefully,"I said. "Five million dollars in investment capital against a few hours of cnlin
 

Contact me when you've made your decision." I ended the call,feeling a sense of release as I set the phone down.

Robert was merely a pawn on my chessboard, unaware he was helping me play a much larger game. When he impersonated me and chatted with Sarah,he would witness firsthand her true nature-the greed sparkling in her eyes, not love. He would discover her "affection" was nothing more than a carefully orchestrated performance, a tool to gain what she wanted.
And when Philip discovered the child in her womb might not be his,he would discard her like a worn-out rag.

I couldn't suppress the cold smile that formed on my lips. Sarah would ultimately be left with nothing-no Philip, no Robert, and certainly not me.
The men she had tried to manipulate would see her for what she truly was,one by one.

The only variable was Robert. I needed him to be intelligent enough to execute my plan, yet foolish enough to believe the reasons I'd given him.

The glass door slid open behind me, and Annie's perfume reached me before she did. My body responded immediately to her presence-a visceral reaction I couldn't control. She moved to stand beside me,offering me a glass of water. Her fingertips brushed against the back of my hand.sending an electric current through my skin.

"What are you thinking about?" She leaned forward, her eyes searching mine. "You're smiling so mysteriously."

She was close enough that I could count each of her eyelashes. Her lips were moist from the water she'd just sipped, tempting me.

"I'm planning a surprise for you," I deliberately lowered my voice,"after
 

Sarah's baby is born. You'll be pleased."

Curiosity flashed in her eyes, but her wisdom prevented her from asking further questions. That was something I admired about Annie-she knew when to remain silent.
"Then I'll look forward to it." Her smile contained a trust that warmed something deep inside me.

I took a sip of water, my gaze never leaving her lips. She noticed,her cheeks flushing slightly, but she didn't look away.

The silence wasn't awkward at all.


"It's getting late," Annie finally said,glancing at her watch. Her voice carried the gentle weight of tiredness. "We should get some rest."

I caught her wrist, feeling her pulse quicken beneath my thumb.She didn't pull away. Instead,she moved closer.

"When I'm less busy, we should travel together," I said, my thumb gently caressing the soft skin on the inside of her wrist."Just the two of us.I want to know you better."

"Is that necessary?" Annie tilted her head, her eyes particularly bright in the moonlight. "I feel like we already know each other quite well."

My fingers traveled up her arm, feeling the subtle trembling of her skin.

"We've never really had a conflict," I looked directly into her eyes,my voice dropping lower. "I want to know how you react when we disagree...I want to see all of you, the good and the bad."

Her breathing quickened, her eyes flickering with desire mingled with
 

thoughtfulness.

"Why not wait until Lucy's school break, and the three of us can go together?" she suggested. her voice slightly husky. "That way,we can see how we function as a family."

When she said "family." I felt a satisfactionI'd never experienced before.I couldn't resist pulling her closer, my arm encireling her waist.
"Whatever you want," I whispered near her ear, feeling her shiver against me. "Your ideas always surprise me in the best ways."

Annie nestled against me, her soft body pressed to mine. Her hair brushed against my chin, sending a pleasant tingle down my spine.
"If only Philip and his family would stop interfering in my life," she said softly, her lips almost touching my neck,"everything would be perfect."
I tightened my arms around her, my hand sliding down her back, feeling her breath catch as I touched her.

"That will happen soon," I promised, my voice deepening with desire."Tll help youresolve this problem."

She looked up at me, our faces inches apart, her pupils dilated with wanting.

"You sound so certain," she breathed.


I lowered my head, stopping with my lips just centimeters from hers.She unconsciously licked her lips, a gesture that sent heat coursing through me.

"We're together now, and we're good together," my fingers wound into her hair. "As time passes, it will only get better."
 

"Eventually, we'll marry." I continued, my voice growing huskier."Philip will understand he has no hope left."

I gently bit her earlobe, satisfied by her soft gasp.

"He'll avoid you on his own, knowing you belong with me forever."

Annie's fingers clutched at my shirt, her body growing warm in my embrace.

"I wish that day would come sooner," she said, her fingertips tracing the muscle contours of my chest through my shirt.

I captured her hand and brought it to my lips, placing a light kiss on her fingers. Desire flickered in her eyes.

"By the way," I deliberately changed the subject, wanting to test her reaction, "I'm planning to groom Lucy to inherit my company."

Annie's expression shifted from desire to surprise, but she didn't pull away from me.

"I need to start preparing her soon," I said, my fingers tracing her collarbone.

"She's only five!" Annie's brow furrowed slightly.

My hand rested on her shoulder, my thumb gently caressing her neck. Her pulse quickened, but she didn't move away.

"To develop a business mindset, you have to start early. I won't be teaching her complex strategies," my tone was firm but gentle. "Rather,values and principles for handling situations."

Annie listened attentively, her expression soft. She neither dismissed my
 

words nor questioned them. I suddenly realized she was the first woman T'd met who truly listened to me.

"I didn't realize you were planning so far ahead... I support you," she said softly.

That simple statement of support tightened something in my chest.Not because of what she said, but because of the trust in her eyes as she said it.

"Thank you," my voice was rougher than I'd intended. "Your support means a great deal to me."

"Lucy is your daughter," Annie's hand came up to touch my cheek. "I already think of her as my own."
Her words struck something deep within me.I held her tightly, controlling myself to not appear too emotional.
"Starting tomorrow, I'll make time to be with Lucy,teach her some basic principles," I murmured into her hair.
"All right," Annie looked up, her lips nearly touching mine. "I'm confident she'll become an excellent heir."

I couldn't restrain myself any longer and claimed her lips with mine. Her mouth opened eagerly to mine, a soft moan escaping her throat as our tongues met. The sound sent heat rushing straight to my groin.

In one fluid motion, I lifted her into my arms, her legs instinctively wrapping around my waist. Our bodies pressed together, my hardness evident against her softness.

"Bedroom," I growled against her neck, already carrying her through the doorway.
 
###Chapter 102: Maybe Someday, Our Rel ati onship Could Be Repaired

Annie's POV

I woke from a deep sleepto find myself in Howard's bed. The space beside me was empty, but his scent still lingered on the pillow. I ran my fingertips lightly over the spot where he had slept, feeling the lingering warmth and recalling moments of intimacy from the night before.A sweetness spread through me, along with a sense of security that felt entirely different from my time with Philip. Back then, even sharing a bed had often left me feelingprofoundly alone.
After collecting my thoughts, I got up and dressed, quicklyfreshening up before leaving the bedroom. Standing in the hallway, I took a deep breath,feeling a sense of stability I hadn't experienced in years. This house was gradually becoming a true home in every sense of the word.
I wanted to find Lucy, and as I walked down the hallway, I heard voices coming from ahead. Following the sound, I discovered Howard crouching in front of Lucy, telling her a story. Lucy had initially tried to break free from Howard to find me, but as the story progressed to a crucial point, she became completely captivated.

Only when Howard finished and began extracting the business principles from the story did Lucy's expression change to one of sudden understanding.Her eyes still filled with curiosity, she asked, "Dad, are there more stories like this one?"

"Of course," Howard gently patted her back reassuringly. "Go get ready.and when we take you to school, I'll tell you another one."
 

"You promise?" Lucy fixed Howard with an intense stare. "No last-minute changes!"

It was clear Lucy genuinely enjoyed these little stories.

Howard smiled tenderly: "I promise."

Lucy immediately dashed toward her bedroom, her face alight with anticipation. Watching her retreating figure,I couldn't help remembering Brian at her age, showing the same enthusiasm for the fairy tales I used to tell him. That seemed like a lifetime ago now.
I approached Howard, silently comparing his parenting style to Philip's completely different approach. "Your method seems quite effective."
"Yes." Howard nodded, clearly pleased that Lucy was willing to listen to his stories. "I even considered setting up a small shop for Lucy to manage herself."
"Do you realize how old she is?" I asked, surprised. For an experienced businessman, the idea of having a five-year-old manage a store seemed startling.

Howard nodded: "Precisely because I know her age, I abandoned that idea."


I sighed in relief and offered my perspective: "It would be more appropriate to let her try when she's in college. It's too early now."

Howard took my hand: "That's exactly what I was thinking. Let her explore freely during her first two years of university, then start taking over the company in her final two years. By the time she graduates, we can travel the world together and enjoy life."


I looked at him seriously: "That won't work. Howard, even after she graduates,you can't retire immediately. You'll need to stay by her side for at least two more years. Only when she's fully adjusted can you completely step back. Otherwise. I'm concerned the pressure would be too overwhelming for her."
Howard disagreed: "I made my own way when I was young."

"But times are different now." I countered. "Besides, you built your company step by step. You know how massive Howard Technologies has become. If someone had handed you such a large company to manage right after graduation, could you have handled it?"
Howard was momentarily speechless. In his eyes. I saw a flicker of surprise-he probably hadn't expected me to so directly point out the flaws in his plan.
I didn't push him for an immediate answer, just calmly held his gaze. This was a delicate balance in our relationship: he understood business, while I understood emotions and growth. We complemented each other, rather than one person always leading.

After consideration, a look of acknowledgment flashed in Howard's eyes,and he nodded: "All right, we'll do it your way."

I felt relief wash over me,along with a warm sense of being respected.
When I was with Philip, my suggestions were rarely truly heard: "Good."

After breakfast, we took Lucy to school together. Usually, she preferred staying close to me, but today, she was drawn to Howard, captivated by his stories. She looked at him expectantly.

Howard was clearly pleased with this change. He gently placed his large
hand on her back and began telling another story.
I listened alongside them,growing increasingly surprised by Howard's approach. He was completely different from others. Most people prefer teaching children with abstract principles, but Howard transformed these principles into simple, relatable stories. After hearing them, Lucy felt as though these events had actually happened.'

She looked up at Howard, curiosity sparkling in her eyes:"Dad,did your friends really experience these things?"
Howard didn't deny it: "In a sense,yes."

"I've noticed many of your stories are about bosses unwilling to pay employees fair wages," Lucy observed, looking confused. "But if employees received more money, wouldn't they work harder and create more profit for the company? Don't they want the company to succeed?"

Howard gently stroked Lucy's head: "Not necessarily."

Lucy looked even more perplexed.

Howard smiled as he explained: "Initially, it might be because there isn't enough startup capital-they don't have enough money to pay others.Later, when they start making money, they become unwilling to share.Lucy,you need to understand that human nature is inherently greedy."

Lucy tilted her head: "Why do you say that?"

"Let me use you as an example," Howard said, gently pinching her cheek."Suppose you received two hundred dollars in allowance each month. You could buy anything you wanted, and no one at home would interfere."

Lucy's eyes brightened: "That would be amazing!"
 .

"Yes," Howard continued, "but what if you wanted a toy that cost a thousand dollars, and you didn't have enough money? What would you do?"


Lucy couldn't come up with an answer.

Howard went on: "You could either save money or earn more. But if you save, it would take five months. If you partnered with Penny to earn money, promising her half of your monthly income as her salary..."
Lucy carefully calculated using her fingers.

Howard watched her chubby fingers move back and forth, his eyes radiating a tenderness I'd never seen before. I quietly observed his expression, realizing that Lucy was becoming the bond connecting us-a little angel who could bring out a softer side even in a business elite like Howard.

"In the first month, you earned four hundred dollars and gave her two hundred. At this point, you still need six hundred dollars to buy the toy you want. In the second month, you earned eight hunadred dollars,"Howard's voice was deep and powerful, yet without any commanding tone.
He leaned closer to Lucy, his voice becoming more intimate: "Would you give her just two hundred dollars, keep six hundred for yourself, and immediately buy the toy you want? Or would you give her four hundred dollars and keep four hundred for yourself?"

Lucy fell into deep contemplation: "If I give her four hundred dollars,I'd have to wait another month."

Howard didn't pressure her for a precise answer: "Exactly. When you can overcome greed and appropriately compensate others for what they deserve,
 .you become a qualified businessperson."

Lucy nodded seriously: "Dad, don't worry. I'll try my best."

Howard looked at her with pride.

After a while, Lucy asked curiously: "By the way, Dad, do I absolutely have to become a businessperson in the future?"

This question caught Howard off guard. He had hoped to leave the company to Lucy as her inheritance but had apparently never considered whether this was what Lucy actually wanted.

After a long silence, he asked: "Don't you want to be in business?"

Lucy thought carefully: "I don't know yet."

When the car stopped at the kindergarten entrance, Lucy quickly said goodbye to us. Spotting Penny in the distance, she immediately ran over,eager to share Howard's stories. Penny listened attentively, her head slightly tilted in curiosity.

I noticed Brian-my son-changing his walking rhythm. Usually, he would hurry past Lucy, but today he slowed his pace. Something in Lucy's conversation seemed to have caught his attention, making him pause.

I watched as Brian slowed down, following Lucy and Penny into the school grounds, and felt a spark of hope rise within me. This was the first time he had shown interest in Lucy, perhaps a good sign.

Maybe someday, our relationship could be repaired.
 
###Chapter 103: Plans Within Plans

Annie's POV

Howard sat in thecar with an unusually serious expression. As we drove toward the company, his brow remained furrowed,lost in thought.

He hadn't spoken since we left home, which was unusual for our morning commute.

"What are you thinking about?" I asked, noticing his contemplative state.

Howard rubbed his temple before answering. "I just realized that perhaps our plan has been too optimistic." He sighed deeply. "We've been assuming Lucy will take over the company after she graduates from college.



"But we haven't considered what happens if she's not interested in running the company."

This was indeed a valid concern we had yet to address.

After a moment's hesitation, I asked, "Are there other potential heirs?"

Howard shook his head firmly. "No."

"There are some distantrelatives with children," he continued, his voice steady. "But I don't trust them."


"They're too far removed from Lucy," he explained, genuine concern in his eyes. "If I gave the company to them, how would I ensure they'd provide Lucy with appropriate living expenses?"

I couldn't help but smile at his long-term thinking. "Aren't you thinking

 

too far ahead?"

"Either way, I'm her father," Howard replied calmly. "These are things f need to consider."

"True," I agreed, patting the back of his hand reassuringly. "But all these worries are based on the assumption that she doesn't want to take over the company."

"Howard, canI't interest be cultivated?" I suggested.

Howard looked at me with surprise.

"If you're willing to gradually influence her, I believe she'll learn to enjoy making money someday," I continued confidently.

My words seemed to dispel Howard's concerns. "You're right."

I completely understood his position. In business and corporate matters,Howard was always confident and decisive. But when it came to raising a child, he lacked experience. This inexperience sometimes led him to overthink.


I held his hand, offering silent support.

Howard's demeanor relaxed. "Thank you," he said softly.

"You're welcome," I responded with a gentle smile.

After arriving at the company, we each returned to our respective offices.

I had just begun working on my children's book drafts when my phone suddenly vibrated with multiple notifications. Opening the messages, I was surprised to find they contained screenshots of several chat conversations.
 

Checking the sender. I saw it was Caroline Gluck-Sarah's friend. She rarely contacted me, so sending these must be related to Sarah somehow.


Caroline followed with an explanation: "Last night. Howard added Sarah with a private account and chatted with her until late."

"Is this what a man who loves you would do?" she added sarcastically."Not very impressive, is it?"

Frowning. I opened the screenshots to examine the content. Sarah's profile picture was the one she always used, chatting enthusiastically with an account labeled "Howard Thompson" that was sending numerous messages.

"Howard's" responses were cold and brief.


I stared at the screenshots, feeling a mixture of confusion and unease.Howard had been with me all last night; we'd stayed in bed until late.This morning he'd risen early to tell Lucy stories, then we'd had breakfast together before driving to work. Howard simply couldn't have had time to chat with Sarah.


Were these screenshots fake? Or was there something I didn't know about?


Suddenly,I remembered Howard mentioning on the balcony yesterday that when I publicly exposed Sarah's behavior, he would also give me a surprise gift. Was this what he had been referring to?

I needed to find out. Setting aside my work, I took my phone and left my office, taking the elevator up to Howard's floor. His secretary Susan saw me and nodded with a smile, indicating I could go in directly.

I knocked lightly on the door and entered Howard's spacious office. He was focused on his computer screen but looked up when he heard my
 

footsteps.

"Is this the gift you prepared for me?" I asked tentatively,showing him the screenshots on my phone.

Howard glanced at them briefly. "Yes."

"But don't worry," he reassured me, "I don't have time to waste on her."

"The person chatting with her daily is actually her ex-husband, Robert."

This statement made everything clear. I quickly understood Howard's strategy.Sarah currently had two men she could manipulate: Philip and Robert. But evidently, that wasn't enough for her-she was also trying to entangle Howard.

"You've got Robert pretending to be you while chatting with Sarah," I articulated the first part of the plan, "so when the true father of the baby in her womb is finally revealed..."


Howard's eyes flashed with appreciation as he nodded for me to continue.

"...she'll immediately lose Philip's support," I analyzed. "After losing Philip.she would naturally try to secure you as a backup. But when she discovers she's been talking to Robert all along..."

"She'll completely collapse, losing her final escape route," Howard finished.his eyes gleaming with admiration.


"You invested in Robert's business, didn't you?" I asked, already certain this was part of the plan.

Howard raised an eyebrow, slightly surprised. "How did you know?"

"That's the most perfect revenge," I reasoned.′′Robert remained poor,

Sarah wouldn't care about losing him. But if Robert regains his wealth..."

"She'll deeply regret losing a man who not only loved her but was also financially stable," Howard picked up my train of thought. "The psychological impact will be devastating."

Howard nodded appreciatively. "You understand my thinking well."

"Is it fair to target only Sarah?" I questioned, thinking about how Philip had been equally despicable in our marriage.

Howard squeezed my hand reassuringly. "Don't worry, that's already ín the plan."

"You just need to wait."

Philip was a fool who would believe anything Sarah said. With what we knew-that Sarah's baby wasn't Philip's, and that Philip had already alienated his own son-the situation was already primed for disaster.

Sarah, to ensure the interests of her unborn child,would likely convince Philip to undergo a vasectomy. When Philip discovered the child wasn't his, it would be too late-he would permanently lose the ability to have more children.


Howard didn't need to intervene much. He just needed to watch Philip's life crumble.


"Alright," I replied, soothed by Howard's confirmation.′′Ijust wanted to make sure it wasn't you chatting with her, to avoid any misunderstandings.
"

Howard's gaze softened with approval. "I appreciate that you're willing to discuss these concerns with me. That's good."
 

"Keeping things bottled up damages our relationship, even when nothing actually happened."

"Yes," I agreed, reflecting on my past with Philip. I had tried to communicate openly with him, explaining my feelings and concerns,but Philip never cooperated.

He would impatiently dismiss my worries, saying things like, "Why are you bothering about these trivial matters?"

Or he would insist that once something was in the past, it should be forgotten.

He always made me feel like I was being petty or overly sensitive.
Eventually, I stopped trying to communicate and became silent.

Now, finding someone whose thoughts aligned with mine brought me genuine happiness.

"Howard, I really appreciate that you consider my feelings," I said sincerely.

"You're welcome," Howard replied, taking my hand and gently stroking it with his thumb. "I just made some minor adjustments to your original plan."


Just then, Howard's phone rang. He answered and put it on speaker."Hello?"


"Mr. Thompson, Robert Johnson is waiting for you in the meeting room.
When would you like to meet him?" his secretary's voice came through.

"Right away!" Howard responded. He had specifically cleared his morning schedule for this meeting. He quickly stood up and said to me, "I'm going to discuss business cooperation with Robert. You continue with your work."

I couldn't help buit smile. "Of course."
 
###Chapter 104: Hope Things Go Smoothly

Howard's POV

I walked briskly toward the meeting room,my thoughts lingering on the conversation I'd just had with Annie. My plan was progressing smoothly-having Robert pretend to be me while chatting with Sarah was a clever arrangement that would ensure her complete collapse when the truth was revealed, leaving her without any support. The "gift" for Philip was also prepared, waiting only for the right moment to be unveiled.


As I pushed open the door, I paused momentarily. The Robert Johnson standing by the window was almost unrecognizable from the drunk,desperate man I'd encountered in that photography studio.He'd cut his hair, shaved his stubble, and wore a suit that, while not custom-tailored.was clean and proper. The most noticeable change was in his eyes-no longer cloudy and empty, but rekindled with a spark of life and hope.


When our gazes met, an unspoken awkwardness filled the air.He unconsciously touched his cheek, where I had landed my fist. I noticed his fingers trembling slightly, suggesting the memory still made him uneasy.

"Mr. Thompson," he said, immediately straightening his posture when he saw me enter. His tone carried a careful respect, though his eyes instinctively avoided direct contact.


I acknowledged him with an expressionless nod, deliberately ignoring our unpleasant history. I had no regrets about intervening for Annie's sake,but at present. I needed Robert's cooperation.

"Have a seat," I said, gracefully settling in the chair opposite him."Before I transfer the investment funds to you, would you mind if I reviewed your business proposal?"
 

The tension between us remained palpable. He attempted to maintain professionalism, but quickly averted his gaze whenever our eyes met. For a man who had once been knocked to the ground by me, now engaging in business negotiations with me, this discomfort was practically inevitable.


I knew Robert understood this was a rare opportunity. My time was exceedingly valuable in business circles. Many who requested my help reviewing their proposals were politely declined, yet here I was, offering assistance voluntarily.


Robert quickly retrieved documents from his briefcase and handed them to me. "Not at all. This is my latest business pan."

I accepted the papers, examining several pages with focused attention before looking up. "Do you have a pen?"

"Yes!" He reached into his suit pocket almost eagerly, producing a pen.

I returned the documents to him and began methodically identifying issues and suggesting improvements. As I watched Robert diligently taking notes, I privately assessed his reactions and comprehension.He appeared to possess genuine business acumen, merely lacking proper guidance.

"Your market analysis is overly optimistic," I explained patiently. "You should consider more potential risk factors."

After completing my review. Robert expressed his gratitude: "Thank you.Mr. Thompson. Your advice is invaluable."

"You're welcome," I replied with a composed expression. "Leave your account details with me, and I'll have my secretary transfer the funds to you."

"When my company succeeds. I won't forget your support," Robert said.
 

his voice barely containing his excitement.

"Don't mention it," I nodded casually.

Just as the meeting appeared to be concluding, I noticed Robert hesitating,glancing at me several times before looking down again.

"If you have something to say, you can tell me directly. There's no need to be evasive," I stated frankly.

Robert unconsciously touched his cheek where I had struck him, his expression somewhat embarrassed. "I... we've met before."

I maintained professional composure, though my eyes reflected acknowledgment. "At the photography studio."

A subtle tension permeated the air. We both recalled the moment I had burst through the door and violently knocked him to the ground.

"About that day... I owe Annie an apology, and you an explanation,"Robert said quietly, guilt evident in his voice. "I understand why you had every right to be angry with me then."


I merely tapped the armrest lightly, waiting for him to continue. I had no regrets about protecting Annie.

"When Philip brought Annie to my place... I never touched her," Robert looked directly into my eyes, sincerity visible in his gaze. "Even in her condition, she somehow managed to awaken my conscience. If not for her strength and wisdom that day, I'd probably still be lost, with no direction in life."


I noticed Robert touching the still-bruised area on his chin. but I showed no remorse. Protecting Annie had been instinctive for me-even knowing

the truth now. I wouldn't apologize for my actions.

"She's a remarkable woman," Robert added softly. "I truly hope she finds happiness."


My expression softened slightly. "I'm glad to hear the truth."

"It's the least I could do." Robert handed me a note with his bank account number.


Taking the note, my tone became somewhat gentler. "If you have other questions in the future, you can come to me. If I have time, I'll certainly help you. Robert, I now want your company to succeed quickly more than anyone else."

"Is it because I just mentioned Annie?" Robert asked.pleasantly surprised.

I didn't answer directly. "Primarily because I see potentiaI in your project."

Watching Robert leave with renewed confidence, a satisfied smile formed on my lips. His candor had once again confirmed Annie's innocence,strengthening my resolve to exact revenge on those who had hurt her.


Shortly after Robert's departure, my secretary knocked and entered. "Mr.Thompson."

"Yes," I crossed my legs, signaling her to continue.


"Regarding Annie," Susan Moore reported, "after she handled Sarah's online provocation the other day, sales of the company's peripheral products showed remarkable growth."

She reviewed data on her tablet, surprise evident in her eyes. "Sales are three times higher than projected.
 

Multiple online platforms are discussing her confrontation with Sarah,generating substantial traffic and attention."

"That's good news." I nodded slightly. Annie's wit and courage had impressed me once again.


"Yes," Susan Moore added, "though I'm concerned this might just be a temporary effect, and the interest could fade quickly."

I tapped the desk, contemplation in my eyes. "Do you see that as a problem?"

Susan Moore paused momentarily. "Indeed, I forgot we were already planning to increase Annie's exposure and promotion."

"How are the negotiations with the publishing house progressing?" I shifted directly to the next topic.

"Smoothly," Susan Moore reported concisely. "We're emphasizing expanding influence as a priority,accepting lower per-book profits for long-term growth."


"Exactly right." I nodded approvingly. "We're building a lasting brand, not chasing short-term gains."


"Additionally," Susan Moore continued, "we've prepared sufficient production capacity to ensure we won't face supply shortages."

"Excellent." I tapped the desk with satisfaction. "You've performed exceptionally during this period. I've decided to allocate a portion of the company's earnings from Annie's works as your additional bonus."

Susan Moore's eyes immediately brightened. "Really?"

"Of course." I said calmly. "You know I never make empty promises."

"Thank you for your trust! I won't disappoint you!" Susan Moore could barely contain her excitement.

"But remember, no matter how busy work gets. you must take care of your health." I gestured slightly,indicating she could leave.


After Susan Moore departed, I walked to the floor-to-ceiling window.Annie's career was flourishing,giving me genuine satisfaction.

I reflected on Annie from last night, her soft lips, those slender legs wrapped around my waist... The mere thought was enough to make my body warm. If not for my work responsibilities, I'd call her to my office right now, have her sit on my desk while I slowly unbuttoned her blouse,and then...

I took a deep breath, forcing myself back to reality. In the reflection of the window, I noticed the desire flickering in my own eyes, which made me smile slightly. Annie affected me more profoundly than any woman ever had.


I just hope things continue to go this smoothly.
 
###Chapter 105: Is There Anything Else We Coul d Try?

Philip's POV

I stormed into my office, hurling my briefcase onto the desk with enough force to make the windows rattle. The sound startled employees passing by my door, their heads turning in unison before quickly averting their gazes. I didn't care. The hospital visit with Sarah had ignited a rage I could barely contain.

There had been absolutely nothing wrong with her. No complications. No emergency. Just another manipulation that had pulled me away from critical mneetings. I collapsed into my leather chair, massaging my temples in circular motions, trying to calm the pounding in my head.

The shrill ring of my phone cut through the momentary silence. Mother. I stared at her name flashing on the screen, debating whether to answer. On the fifth ring. I reluctantly picked up.

"Is Sarah alright?" Betty's voice carried the unmistakable tone of concern that had become exclusively reserved for Sarah and her pregnancy.

"Just mentioning her makes me angry," I practically hissed through clenched teeth. "But the doctor says the baby is fine. In fact, there was never anything wrong in the first place."


"That's a relief." The tension in my mother's voice immediately dissolved,replaced by her typical authoritative tone. "Philip, I think you should consider reconciling with Sarah. She's carrying your child, after all."

"Absolutely not!" I shot up from my chair, my voice rising involuntarily.The anger bubbling inside me threatened to spill over completely.
 

"Calm down, Philip," Mother's voice sharpened. "You're always so emotional. You need to think about the Baker family interests first. That means Sarah's baby must be protected at all costs. The Baker family needs an heir."


Her words struck their intended target. I inhaled deeply, fighting to regain control. Brian's estrangement had already been a devastating blow. Could I really risk losing another child?


"I understand." I finally replied, my voice carefully measured before ending the call.


After hanging up, I walked to the window as an overwhelming sense of powerlessness washed over me. Why was I so fixated on having children?This obsession likely stemmed from my mother's influence and family expectations.

The pressure to continue the Baker legacy weighed heavily on me.especially after my failed marriage and estrangement from Brian. For a moment, I felt trapped in an inescapable cycle-my mother's expectations.family pressure, Sarah's manipulations, and my guilt toward Annie.

I shook my head vigorously, trying to dispel these suffocating thoughts.I was Philip Baker,Wall Street elite. I could solve any problem. A plan began forming in my mind-if I could approach Annie through copyright negotiations, perhaps I could salvage something. This thought lightened my mood momentarily, reigniting a small spark of hope.

As I was lost in thought, my secretary knocked gently on the door frame,standing at the entrance to my office. The expression on her face immediately dimmed my newfound optimism.

"Has the copyright purchase from Annie been completed?" I asked eagerly,
 

leaning forward unconsciously. This question was far more than a business transaction to me-it represented my chance to reconnect with Annie.


"She directed me to contact Howard Technologies' comic department, but I believe she doesn't want to sell the copyright to us," my secretary replied cautiously.


"What do you mean?" I frowned, feeling a wave of disappointment that quickly transformed into indignant anger.

My initial plan had been to offer a low price merely as a legitimate excuse to contact Annie. Now it seemed that approach might not work,but I wasn't ready to give up.

My secretary continued her report: "I've heard her children's book merchandise is selling extremely well through Howard Technologies.Her monthly commissions are growing substantially."

This news stirred complex emotions within me. Instantly, jealousy and regret surged through me-why couldn't this success have happened under my support? Why was it Howard, not me, who provided her the platform to showcase her talent?


"Is that so?" I'responded with feigned composure, though my fingers unconsciously clenched into fists, knuckles turning white. I recognized my own contradiction-never hesitating to spend lavishly on jewelry for Sarah,yet becoming so miserly when it came to Annie's copyright. This disparity filled me with shame, which I quickly masked with arrogance.

"Since she thinks our current price is too low, we can increase our offer," I said, injecting an artificial casualness into my voice, as if this were merely a routine business decision. "As long as the copyright price doesn't exceed
 

a certain amount, you can continue negotiating with them."

A thought flashed through my mind: if I offered Annie a substantial sum all at once, surely she would be persuaded. After all, who could resist the temptation of a large amount of money? This idea reinvigorated me briefly,but was quickly followed by self-loathing-once again, I was trying to solve problems with money, just as I did with Sarah.

"I'll contact them immediately," my secretary nodded, pulling out her phone to send messages.

I tried to focus on other documents, buit my concentration was completely shot. My fingers drummed incessantly on the desktop, eyes fixed on the clock, each minute stretching interminably. Finally, my secretary returned to my desk.

"Mr. Baker. Tve contacted the copyright manager at Howard Technologies comic department.'

She showed me the entire conversation: first asking if the refusal was due to the price being too low, then proposing a higher amount, and finally offering a substantíal sum. Each response was a rejection, with the copyright manager's final reply being unequivocal: "This isn't about money.



After reading the messages, I jumped to my feet, staring at the phone screen in disbelief. Anger, confusion, and hurt tangled together in my chest.

"That's impossible!" I exclaimed, feeling a rage born of humiliation. "No one turns down an offer like this! I'm willing to provide an extremely generous price, and they still refuse to sell?"

I paced back and forth, fingers roughly combing through my hair,unable
 

to comprehend the meaning behind this rejection. Did Annie truly hate me so much that she wouldn't even do business with me? Or was Howard interfering, deliberately blocking my attempts to approach Annie?

"Are they trying to drive up the price?" I asked,my voice tinged with desperate hope-if it was merely about price, I still had a chance.

My secretary analyzed the situation with professional detachment. "Annie is earning significant commissions through Howard Technologies.With her income trending upward, she has no financial incentive to sell her copyright, regardless of our offer."

Her words extinguished my anger, leaving only a hollow feeling in its place. I loosened my tie and slumped back in my chair.

"So there's nothing we can do," I murmured.

The realization hit hard. Annie was thriving without me-achieving the success I'd never helped her reach. I'd always assumed she needed me, but the truth was painfully clear: she was better off without me. The thought wounded my pride deeply.

After a moment, I straightened up. "No, there must be a way."

"What do you suggest?" I asked, desperate for any solution that might reconnect me with Annie.


"You have two options," my secretary replied. "Either partner with Howard Technologies, or develop our own competing products."

I fell silent. Her advice made perfect business sense, but I had no real interest in chíldren's books-I only wanted an excuse to see Annie again.Now even that slim chance was gone.

"Is there anything else we could try?" I asked, unable to hide the hope in my voice.

"Yes," she answered simply.

"Oh?" I looked up, a spark reigniting in my eyes. Perhaps there was still a chance to repair my mistakes, to win back Annie's heart. "What is it?"


My secretaryhesitated momentarily. "You could try reaching out to her through her mother."

My expression darkened immediately. "Ruth Miller?"

Yeah. maybe it could work.
 
###Chapter 106: My plan

Sarah's POV

I sat at my vanity, scrolling through Howard Thompson's chat messages from last night for what must have been the tenth time. Each review only strengthened my conviction in my irresistible charm. The brief responses he'd sent were exactly what I'd expected from a man of his caliber-reserved yet clearly interested. Men like Howard didn't gush; they measured their words carefully. But the fact that he'd messaged me at all was the validation I needed.

With a satisfied smile. I tapped the screen to capture several screenshots.then swiftly composed a message to Caroline Gluck.

"Send these screenshots to Annie Baker," I wrote, my manicured nails clicking against the screen. "Let her see who her man was chatting with last night."


I swiveled in my luxurious leather chair, savoring the mental image of Annie's face when she received these screenshots-the shock, the anger,the insecurity that would inevitably follow. Howard might thinkhe was devoted to her now, but I'd planted the first seed of doubt. Annie would do the rest of the work for me, questioning him, perhaps even confronting him. Nothing destroys a relationship faster than suspicion.

I gently caressed my swollen belly, feeling the slight movement within.This pregnancy was perhaps my most powerful weapon-it garnered sympathy, protection, and an inexplicable power over mena like Philip who desperately wanted children. Society always sided with expectant mothers.

"Annie Baker," I whispered to my reflection, a cold smile playing on my lips, "who do you think you are? Just an illustrator drawing childish
pictures."

I picked up my phone again, checking to confirm Caroline had received my instructions.

"Sent." came her swift reply, making me nod with satisfaction. "Annie will definitely be devastated."

"Well done," I texted back, feeling a rush of control. "We have more plans to execute."


I loved this feeling-orchestrating evens like a master puppeteer while remaining seemingly uninvolved.


I walked toward my walk-in closet, sliding hangers along the rack as I selected today's outfit. The question of Annie's appeal to Howard continued to irritate me.

"A woman from Boston with no family connections or social standing," I muttered as I pulled out a designer maternity dress. "What right does she have to stand beside Howard Thompson?"

The fabric felt exquisite against my skin-soft, expensive, worthy of the woman I was.


"Howard has always had impeccable taste in everything," I mused,smoothing the material over my stomach. "How could he possibly look at someone like her?"


With my outfit selected, my plan began taking clearer shape in my mind.I
applied my lipstick with methodical precision, contemplating my next
move.

"Betty Baker is the perfect weapon," I thought, my eyes narrowing as I
 

considered Philip's mother. That pompous Upper East Side socialite was so predictable-obsessed with family legacy and social standing.She'd been fawning over my pregnancy since the announcement, desperate for another grandchild since Brian had become so distant.

I reached for my phone and dialed Betty Baker's number, my facial expression instantly transforming into one of vulnerable distress.

Betty answered almost immediately. "Sarah, dear! How are you feeling today?"

"Oh, Betty," I said, deliberately making my voice sound fragile and emotional. "I've been better..."

"What's wrong? Is it the baby?" The immediate concern in her voice made me smile inwardly. So predictable.

I launched into my carefully crafted narrative, a masterfully edited version of recent events that painted me as the innocent victim and Annie as the heartless aggressor.

"I'm carrying the Baker family's precious grandson," I said sweetly. "But Annie... she's been so cruel to me."

"What did she do?" Betty's voice already had an edge to it.

"I merely expressed some thoughts online," I said, my voice deliberately smaller, "and Annie publicly humiliated me. She should have just stayed quiet, considering her history with Philip. After all, she's just a woman Philip didn't want anymore. What right does she have to attack me?"

I paused, letting my words sink in before delivering the knockout punch.

"The stress she caused..." I let my voice break slightly, "It nearly made me

miscarry. Can you imagine? Your grandson almost lost because of her vindictiveness."


"That's absolutely outrageous!" Betty practically shouted into the phone."How dare she!"


"I know," I whimpered. "Philip tried to defend me, and she humiliated him too. I'm starting to think I should just avoid her completely.Since she enjoys bullying me and no one can stand up for me... she'll probably keep finding ways to attack me. If I stay far away from her,maybe she'll insult me less often."


I could practically hear Betty's blood pressure rising through the phone.

"You absolutely do not need to hide!" Betty's voice rose indignantly. "Wait right there, I'm going to teach her a lesson she won't forget!"

"You would do that for me?" I injected a note of hopeful surprise into my voice.


"Of course! Who does she think she is to offend anyone she pleases? Has she forgotten how I disciplined her when she was in our family? She needs to be reminded of her place!"

I allowed a small smile to form on my lips. My prey had taken the bait perfectly.

"Mom!" I exclaimed, using the term I knew would please her."I'm so touched that you're willing to protect me! Honestly, I already feel better knowing you're on my side."

I added the final touch, my voice dropping to an intimate whisper: "I think the baby feels better too... he knows his grandmother loves him so much."
 

"You just wait for my good news!" Betty responded triumphantly before hanging up.

The moment the call ended, my expression transformed instantly. The pitiable, vulnerable "daughter-in-law" act vanished without a trace.

I elegantly wiped away tears that had never actually fallen and smiled smugly at my reflection. These Upper East Side matrons were so predictably manipulable-obsessed with status, family legacy, and their own importance.

I set my phone down and walked to the window. My plan was in perfect motion: Betty would attack Annie while I appeared completely uninvolved.
The beauty of using proxies was that my hands remained clean while chaos unfolded around my targets.

I thought again about Howard's messages from last night, my fingers absently stroking my belly as I imagined my future:

Annie would soon lose her luster in Howard's eyes-her background wasn't suitable for someone of his stature anyway. I would appear at precisely the right moment, displaying my elegance, understanding, and sophistication. Howard would inevitably realize I was the woman truly worthy of standing beside him.

By then, I wouldn't need Philip anymore. The child would secure my position regardless of whose DNA it carried. A paternity test was the last thing I wanted, but I'd cross that bridge if necessary.
 
###Chapter 107: What Can the Police Do to Me

Annie's POV

I was working on my latest children's book illustration when my phone suddenly vibrated against the desk, breaking my concentration. An urgent message from the company's front desk receptionist flashed across the screen: "Mrs. Baker is downstairs causing a scene. She's shouting that you're bullying a pregnant woman."

Betty Baker. My former mother-in-law.

I sat back in my chair, a familiar knot forming in my stomach. Sarah must have been crying to her again, playing the victim as she always did.Some things never changed.

From the window. I could see Betty at the building entrance, dressed in an expensive tailored suit. She was gesturing wildly, and a small crowd had already gathered around her.

"Annie Baker is shameless! She deliberately targets a pregnant woman with harassment!" Betty's shrill voice drifted upward.

A surge of anger rose in my chest, hot and swift, but I breathed deeply and felt it subside almost as quickly. There was a time when a single accusation from Betty would have sent me into a panic, desperate to appease her. That version of Annie Baker no longer existed.

I returned to my desk and opened my computer, fingers moving with deliberate calm. When I moved out of the Baker mansion months ago, the head of security-who had always been kind to me-had given me a special "gift": backup copies of all security camera footage from inside the mansion for the past three years. I'd accepted it thenwithout much
 

thought, never imagining I'd actually need it. But after Sarah began her social media attacks, I'd started organizing these recordings, and unexpectedly discovered some rather illuminating scenes featuring Betty and Sarah.


I quickly prepared the materials, sending commands to the display system in the building lobby. Just as I finished mý preparations, the door to my office burst open. Catherine Morgan strode in, her cheeks flushed with indignation.


"Have you heard? Your former mother-in-law is making a scene downstairs!" she exclaimed breathlessly, her eyes wide with excitement.

"I know," I replied calmly. "I'm preparing to go down and meet her."

Catherine noticed the video clips playing on my computer screen.her curiosity immediately piqued. "What's that?"

"Evidence Betty would prefer people didn't see," I explained, minimizing one window to show another. "When I lived at the Baker house before the divorce, the head of security gave me backups of surveillance footage.I originally kept it as protection against Sarah, but I discovered quite a lot of scenes with Betty's involvement as well."


Catherine's eyes widened as she processed this information. "So you have...



"Enough to shut them up," I answered simply, rising from my chair."Come on, it's time to go downstairs."

We took the elevator down and found the lobby filled with curious onlookers. Betty was still outside, her audience growing.

I pushed open the glass doors and stepped outside. Betty immediately
 

swiveled toward me, marching over until she was just inches from my face,her manicured finger nearly touching my nose.

"You vicious woman!" Her face was ashen with rage, her voice piercing enough to make nearby observers wince. "You just can't accept that my son dumped you! You're jealous of him and Sarah, so you encouraged people to bully my pregnant daughter-in-law online!"

Despite my outward composure, I could feel my heart rate accelerating.

"You want to make her so miserable she miscarries! How evil can you be?"Betty continued her tirade, her eyes bulging with fury, veins standing out on her forehead.

I sensed Catherine tensing beside me, ready to jump to my defense, but I gently gripped her wrist, silently asking her to wait.

"First, let me clarify that I didn't do any of those things," I replied evenly,my voice calm despite the adrenaline coursing through me. "Second, even if I did everything you're accusing me of... it would still be insignificant compared to what you've done to me in the past."

Betty clearly hadn't expected this response. Her eyes narrowed as her lips trembled slightly with shock. "What is that supposed to mean?"

The anger and hurt I'd suppressed for years threatened to surge forth like a tidal wave,but I forced myself to remain composed.

I raised my hand, pointing toward the display screens at the building entrance. "It's quite simple. Let's look at the evidence."

The display screen lit up, and the first video began to play-Betty at a dinner party, deliberately mocking my Boston accent: "Darling, perhaps you should read more books. At least you might learnto speak like

someone with proper breeding." Everyone at the table had laughed while Philip merely frowned slightly, saying nothing in my defense.

Watching this again. I felt a twinge in my stomach as the memory resurfaced. I had cried for an hour after returning to our bedroom that night.


The next clip showed Betty forcing me to wear clothes she had selected:"Either wear this or don't show up at all. Women in the Baker family must maintain certain standards."

The third clip was even more cutting-her picking up one of my drawings and ridiculing it in front of Philip: "These have absolutely no artistic value.They're just childish scribbles."

Betty's expression transformed from anger to horror in an instant, her eyes growing round as saucers, her mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water. "Where... where did you get this? Annie; I order you to turn that off immediately!"

"Why would I listen to you?" I asked, feeling a strange sense of liberation wash over me, as if I'd finally set down a burden I'd been carrying for years.


Betty immediately straightened her posture, her facial muscles tightening."Because I am your mother-in-law!"


"Former mother-in-law," I corrected her, feeling a small satisfaction in the clarification. "I'm divorced from Philip,remember?"

From the crowd of onlookers, comments began to emerge about Betty's behavior.


"What a nightmare ofa mother-in-law," someone muttered.

Betty's cheeks flushed crimson as she heard these remarks. "What are you all looking at? She was my son's wife at the time! How I disciplined her was a family matter!"


"You're right." I nodded, "I didn't fight back then because I was too weak."

Betty appeared to relax slightly. but I continued: "That doesn't mean I didn't keep evidence."


The display screen switched to the most explosive footage-Betty and Sarah conspiring in the study of the Baker mansion.

"This is the only way you'll get Philip," Betty was saying to Sarah in the recording. "Annie is too naive. She'll never suspect it."

Sarah's voice dripped with smugness: "Once Philip gets tired of her boring housewife life, he'll naturally turn to me."

Betty nodded in agreement: "I'll help you. A girl from Boston with no background doesn't deserve to be part of the Baker family."

Shocked murmurs erupted from the crowd. I stood there, feeling a strange serenity wash over me, as if years of injustice had finally found some form of resolution.


"That's outrageous! Helping her son find a mistress?"

"She pretended to care about her daughter-in-law while stabbing her in the back..."


Betty's face had turned deathly pale, her forehead beaded with fine sweat,her eyes darting frantically between the crowd and the screen. "Why are you bringing up the past? This all happened a long time ago!"

Looking at her contorted features. I felt a flicker of pity. She had always believed she was in control, never imagining that one day she would be confronted with her own actions.


"Speaking of recent events." I turned toward the screen, "let's look at what Sarah has been up to lately."

The display showed Sarah's provocative posts and my measured responses.The evidence clearly demonstrated that Sarah had been consistently initiating conflict, while I had merely defended myself.

"So the mistress started it all!"

"Using pregnancy as a shield-disgusting!"

Betty's lips quivered, her hands anxiously clenching and unclenching. "
Even if Sarah made mistakes, she's a pregnant woman. Her emotions are naturally unstable. You should be more understanding."

"Why?" I asked quietly, though my insides were churning. Her favoritism was so blatant, so automatic-just as it had been countless times before.

Betty opened her mouth but no words came out. She suddenly looked ten years older.


"I never initiated any conflict with Sarah," I continued,feeling a strength growing within me. "Each time, she provoked me, and I merely defended myself appropriately. And you, Betty, have come to my workplace to spread lies."

Betty's eyes flickered as she tried to regain her composure."As they say,flies don't land on eggs without cracks! If Sarah targeted you, you must have done something!"
 

With deliberate calm, I pulled out my phone and dialed the police. Betty's expression transformed from arrogance to disbelief, finally settling on fear.

"If you don't listen to me, I'll tell Philip to completely give up on seeing you and Brian!" she threatened, her voice clearly trembling despite her attempt at intimidation.


"Is that so?" I responded coolly, simultaneously explaining the situation to the operator on the other end of the line.

When Betty heard me actually calling the police, her face turned ashen,cold sweat breaking out on her forehead. "I haven't broken any laws.What can the police do to me?"
 
###Chapter 108: She's Probably Chatting With Robert

Annie's POV

The tension in the air had become almost palpable outside Howard Technologies. Betty Baker's expression had transformed from arrogant confidence to growing fear. Her question-"What can the police do to me?"-hung in the air between us.

I maintained eye contact with her while continuing my conversation with the police operator. "Yes, she's been harassing me at my workplace,spreading false accusations, and damaging my professional reputation."

Betty's composure crumbled further, her perfectly manicured finger trembling slightly as she pointed at me. "This is absurd! If anyone's reputation has been damaged, it should be Sarah's!"

The crowd of onlookers began murmuring among themselves. Any sympathy they might have had for Betty had completely evaporated after seeing the video evidence of her past behavior.

"Normally, police might not get involved for mere verbal insults," I explained calmly to the onlookers, "but I'm now considered something of a public figure. Her defamation could easily impact the sales of my products."

I glanced meaningfully at the prominent Howard Technologies logo displayed on the building behind me."And she hasn't just insulted me;she's disparaged Howard Technologies as well. The impact of her actions is quite substantial."

Betty's face grew even paler as the severity of her situation finally seemed to dawn on her. The police wouldn't simply dismiss this as a family
 rt dispute.

"You're overreacting." Betty attempted to appear unconcerned, but her voice had lost its earlier confidence. "This is a private matter between family members."


"Former family members," I corrected her again, my voice quiet but firm."And you brought your accusations to my workplace, which makes it a public matter."

Several members of the crowd nodded in agreement, their eyes shifting between Betty and me.

"I've been nothing but respectful to Sarah," I continued. "Even when she deliberately provoked me, I only defended myself. Yet here you are,trying to intimidate me at my workplace."

Betty's lips pressed into a thin line, her expression hardening as she realized she was losing control of the situation. "Philip was right about you.You're petty and ungrateful!"

I felt a flicker of old pain at her words, but it quickly faded. That particular barb had lost its power over me. "I'm simply protecting myself and my work from your baseless accusations."

Catherine Morgan stepped forward, placing a supportive hand on my shoulder."From what I've seen today, Mrs. Baker, you're the one being petty. Annie has shown remarkable restraint."

Betty shot Catherine a venomous glare but seemed to recognize that she was rapidly losing ground with the crowd.

Thirty minutes later, two police officers arrived promptly. I submitted the evidence I had compiled-not just the videos but also documented records
 rt

of Betty's public accusations. The officers' expressions remained professional and serious as they reviewed the materials.

"Mrs. Baker, we'll need you to come with us to provide a statement," the taller officer said to Betty, whose aristocratic demeanor had completely collapsed by this point.

"This is ridiculous! I haven't done anything wrong!" Betty protested, but her voice lacked conviction. The evidence was too damning, the witnesses too numerous.

When the officers attempted to escort her to the police car, Betty began to struggle. "You can't do this to me! Do you know who my family is?"

The officers remained unmoved by her protests. "Ma'am, please don't make this more complicated than it needs to be."

"This is all your fault," Betty hissed at me, her eyes narrowing with hatred."Philip was right-you're petty and ungrateful!"

I simply watched as the police led her away, feeling neither victorious nor satisfied-just a quiet sense of relief. The cycle of harassment had to end.

As Betty was escorted to the police car, I turned to the remaining onlookers and said, "You've all seen that I didn't instigate any of this. If I truly still had feelings for her son, I would never have allowed his mother to be taken to the police station."

I took a deep breath before continuing, "Besides, I'm in a new relationship now.We're very happy together."

Catherine Morgan, who had been standing supportively by my side throughout the ordeal, shook her head in disbelief. "How can someone be so shameless? You've been completely separated from her son for ages,yet
 rt

she comes to your workplaceto harass you and cause trouble over Sarah's issues? And she expects you to accommodate her daughter-in-law? On what grounds?"


"I honestly don't know," I replied with a shrug.

Catherine seemed eager to continue our conversation, but her expression suddenly changed as she glanced over my shoulder. She quickly crouched down, using the crowd as cover, and began to slip away.

"If Howard asks if you've seen me," she whispered hurriedly, "remember to say you haven't!"

I couldn't help but smile. "Alright."

"What happened here?" Howard's deep voice came from behind me moments later as he stood beside me, his expression concerned.

I was genuinely surprised to see him come down personally. "The usual,"I sighed, explaining. "Sarah received criticism online for her behavior,blamed me for it, and first tried to get Philip to defend her."

"When that failed, shecomplained to her mother-in-law."

Howard raised an eyebrow, silently encouraging me to continue.

"Fortunately, I was prepared," I went on. "I showed everyone evidence of Sarah's provocations... but Betty wasn't satisfied and continued to insult me quite viciously. So I called the police."

Howard gently stroked my head, his touch reassuring. "As long as you weren't hurt."


I smiled up at him, feeling a warmth spread through my chest. "Don't
 rt

worry, I'm quite clever about these things."

A bystander who had witnessed our interaction approached curiously. "Is he your boyfriend?"


I glanced at Howard, uncertain how he wanted to handle this public inquiry about our relationship.

Howard answered without hesitation: "Yes, I am."

This revelation sent ripples of surprise through the remaining crowd.

"Her current boyfriend is actually Mr. Thompson?" someone whispered loudly.

"He's so much better than her ex-husband!" another voice chimed in.

"Absolutely! Mr. Thompson is successful with an excellent reputation."

"Her ex-husband cheated on her and was stingy with her!"

"Only a fool would still pine for such an ex-husband!"

After considerable discussion, the crowd seemed to reach a consensus.

"That old lady had the nerve to claim she still loves her ex-husband?"

"Was she deliberately trying to make us all look like fools?"

As the buzz of the crowd gradually faded behind us, Howard and I returned to his office.


"Sarah is the one who's truly at fault," I mused, leaning against his desk."
Yet when she complains to others, she completely reverses the facts."

"I'm genuinely amazed at her ability to lie so blatantly with a straight face."
 rt

Howard took my hand, his expression thoughtful. "Have you considered that this might be her strategy? That she's deliberately trying to make your life difficult?"


I looked at him, puzzled. "Why would she target me if she doesn't have genuine grievances?"

"Your illustrations are becoming increasingly successful," Howard explained. "She might be envious of you."

His fingers tightened slightly around mine. "She may be attempting to disrupt your peace of mind, keep you constantly frustrated, unable to focus on your work."


"That way,you couldn't earn your own income and would be forced to depend on a man, just like her."

My expression grew serious as I considered his words. "That's quite malicious,isn't it?"

"I absolutely won't let her succeed," I declared with determination. "If she wants me angry and miserable, I'll deliberately be especially happy every day."


Howard nodded approvingly. "Once you understandI her objective, her tactics become transparent."

"If my assessment is correct," he added, "she's probably chatting with Robert right now, who she thinks is me. And I can guess the content-disparaging you while presenting herself in the best light."
 
###Chapter 109: Howard Was Right

Sarah's POV

I lounged in the warm afternoon sunlight streaming through the windows,lazily tapping at my phone screen to compose a message to Howard: "Did my mother-in-law make a scene at Howard Technologies today?"

While waiting for his response, I gently caressed my slightly protruding belly, feeling the subtle movements within. This child represented my future security, regardless of who the biological father might actually be. A smile played across my lips at the thought-men were so easily manipulated by the prospect of fatherhood.

The screen remnained dark. Howard appeared to be busy, not responding immediately. This didn't concern me; men of his caliber were always occupied with important matters. I continued sending messages at a measured pace:

"I'm so sorry."

"I tried to convince her not to go."

"But she insisted."

"Nothing I said could stop her."

Of course, these were complete fabrications. In reality, I had deliberately incited Betty to cause a commotion. That old woman was painfully easy to manipulate, especially when I mentioned "fighting for the Baker family grandson's rights." But Howard didn't need to know any of that.

Finally, a reply appeared: "Is that so? She's older and you're young. If you really wanted to stop her, you probably could have."
 

My heart skipped a beat at such direct criticism. Howard's attitude toward me was typically cool, but he had never questioned my statements before.Could he be starting to see through me? I quickly typed out a defense:

"But I'm pregnant."

"I was worried it might affect the baby."

Silence fell again. I bit my lower lip, deciding to change tactics.Perhaps I should try to extract more information about his feelings toward Annie:

"I don't understand why people around me seem to prefer me."

"While they don't seem to like Annie."

"Like my mother-in-law."

"Since Philip and I got together, she's treated me like her own daughter..."

"She never lets me do heavy work, always saves the best food for me."

"But when Annie was still married to Philip, she wasn't treated nearly as well."


"I heard my mother-in-law often set rules for Annie, making her life miserable."


"Why do you think that is?"

"Am I better in some way?"

As I sent these messages, I inwardly laughed. Each question was carefully crafted to lead Howard into admitting I was more appealing than Annie.However,his response caught me completely off guard:

"Maybe it's because Annie doesn't talk behind people's backs like you do."

I stared at these words, momentarily speechless. This was nothing like Howard's usual manner of speaking. Even when cool toward me, he had never criticized me so bluntly. To maintain the image I'd worked so hard to cultivate, I chose to remain silent, pretending to be offended.

However, today's events were too important, and my curiosity about the outcome was unbearable. Breaking my usual pattern. I took the initiative:

"Anyway, Annie must have been so embarrassed, right?"

A smug smile played on my lips. The mere thought of Annie being publicly humiliated by Betty at her workplace was positively delightful.

"If I were in the same situation, I would have handled it mnuch better."

"I certainly wouldn't lose control of my emotions like Annie and embarrass you."

I deliberately framed it this way, hoping to draw closer to Howard. To show him how different-how elegant and composed-I was compared to Annie.


But his answer was unexpected: "She handled it very well."

This wasn't right. Not only did he fail to agree with my assessment, but he was actually praising Annie?

"The incident today has become quite significant. You can check online."

I immediately opened my browser, my heart racing with anticipation.What I found nearly made me drop my phone.

"Showdown at Howard Technologies! Former Mother-in-Law Confronts

Annie,Gets Publicly Humiliated!"

"Betty Baker's Embarrassing Moment: She Was Supporting Her Son's Mistress All Along!"


"Annie Baker Presents Irrefutable Evidence: Former Mother-in-Law and Mistress Sarah Conspired Against Her!"


I quickly scanned the comments below, each one piercing my heart like a needle:


"Now I understand. why Annie divorced. Who could tolerate such a mother-in-law?"

"Wait, so Sarah was involved with Annie's husband before the divorce?Disgusting!"

"That video is shocking-mother-in-law and mistress plotting to break up her son's marriage. These wealthy families are truly corrupt!"

"Sarah using pregnancy to gain sympathy is despicable!"

"Annie was so composed-if I were her, I would have lost it! Calling the police was exactly the right move for dealing with such people!"

My eyes fell on a news headline: "...Annie Baker then presented multiple video evidences, including footage of Betty Baker and Sarah Johnson conspiring to destroy her marriage..."

Nothing but criticism of me! More people now knew I was the other woman! What had that stupid Betty done? I had only intended for her to provoke Annie, make her lose control and embarrass herself...

I continued scrolling, but the situation only grewworse:

"Truth Revealed: Sarah Johnson and Betty Baker Collaborated to Destroy Philip Baker's Marriage, Now Playing Victim?"

"Annie's Counter-Attack: Wall Street Elite's Ex-Wife Uses Security Footage to Expose Former Mother-in-Law"


"#TeamAnnie is trending, with hundreds of thousands of netizens supporting this brave single mother"

I felt nauseated-this was completely contrary to what I had envisioned!

The outcome was the exact opposite of my plan! Betty's actions had only made things worse! Was that old woman deliberately sabotaging me? Or was she simply too stupid to understand appropriate public behavior?

I took several deep breaths, forcing myself to remain calm. Since things had already reached this point, I might as well continue playing the role of the innocent victim:

"About her former mother-in-law going to her company..."

"Instead of directly addressing her former mother-in-law, she shifted the focus to me."

"Does she hate me that much?"

I feigned naivety: "Why does she harbor such hostility toward me?"

"That's not a question you should be asking me, but yourself," Howard replied almost immediately. "Think about what you've done to her, and I believe you'll understand."

I stared at the screen, momentarily speechless. My fingers hovered over the keyboard,typing several lines of defense, only to delete them one by one.

My heart raced, and fine beads of sweat formed on my forehead.

Howard's words cut like a sharp sword,striking the most vulnerable part of my heart. His tone was so direct,merciless,completely different from his usual style.


A sudden fear gripped my heart. Had he seen through all my pretenses?Or even more terrifying, had he never been genuinely interested in me at all? My plans, my future, the perfect path I had laid out for myself-everything could collapse at this moment.

I abruptly tossed my phone aside and began pacing back and forth in my house, my nails digging deep into my palms. Betty's foolish behavior,the online abuse, Howard's cold response, and Annie-the woman who should have been beneath my feet but was now winning everyone's sympathy and support.

"Damn it!" I slammed my fist into the soft couch; but this did nothing to alleviate my anger. My plans, my perfect image, were disintegrating bit by bit.


I took a deep breath, forcing myself to calm down. Perhaps Howard had a point? No,impossible! I quaickly dismissed the thought and reorganized my thinking. Why should I reflect on my actions? I was only fighting for the life I deserved. This world never treats the weak kindly; everything I did was merely for survival.

Determined to salvage what I could, I picked up my phone again.I needed to reach out to Caroline immediately-she always had useful advice for damage control. But before I could dial her number, another message from Howard appeared on my screen:

"I hope you're learning something valuable from all this,Sarah.Sometimes

the truth has a way of revealing itself, no matter how carefully we try to hide it."


My hands trembled as I read his words. For a moment, I almost felt like I was looking at a completely different person-someone who had been watching me, studying me, perhaps even testing me all along.

I closed my eyes, gathering my scattered thoughts. This wasn't over. A temporary setback didn't mean defeat. I still had Philip,his child growing inside me, and the influence that came with the Baker name.

After all, I'd faced worse challenges before. This was just another obstacle to overcome,another game to play-and I never lost for long.
 
###Chapter 110: Obstinate Delusion

Philip's POV

I had just wrapped up an investment meeting when my phone rang.Seeing my mother's name on the display, I answered casually,"Mom,what is it?"

"I'm at the police station." Betty's voice carried an unnatural tension that immediately set me on edge. "Could you come pick me up?"

"What? Police station?" I sat bolt upright, my attention fully captured."How did you end up there?"

"We'll talk when you get here!" Her tone was impatient as she abruptly ended the call.

I hastily set aside my work and rushed to my car. I couldn't fathom why my mother would be involved with the police.

As I walked into the station, I immediately heard my mother's strident voice echoingthrough the lobby: "This is absolutely ridiculous! I merely went to speak with her-what crime is that?"

I spotted her at the reception desk, confronting a visibly irritated officer.Several passing policemen glanced at the scene, their expressions a mixture of surprise and resignation.

"Mom!" I hurried forward, grasping her arm firmly. "Enough. Let's go home."


Betty turned to face me, her indignation slightly diminishing. "Philip, tell them I've done nothing wrong! I simply went to speak with Annie, and she called the police!"

Annie? Everything suddenly clicked into place. Sarah's recent complaints hadn't been unfounded--my mother had indeed gone to confront Annie.

"I apologize, Officer," I pulled my mother toward the exit while addressing the policeman. "I'll have a serious talk with her."

"Mr. Baker," the officer called after me, "your mother was publicly harassing your ex-wife outside Howard Technologies and spreading defamatory statements. We could have detained her, but considering her age,we've only issued a warning. Please ensure this doesn't happen again."

I nodded in acknowledgment, feeling the heat of embarrassment rise in my face. As my mother attempted to interject, I practically dragged her from the police station and bundled her into my car.

"How could you create such a scene at the police station?" I closed the door, my voice involuntarily rising. "What exactly did you do?"

Betty straightened her collar, which had been disheveled during our exit,and scoffed. "I simply went to Howard Technologies to have a word with Annie. That ungrateful woman actually called the police! As her former mother-in-law, am I not even entitled to speak with her?"

I took a deep breath, forcing myself to remain calm. "Mom, we're divorced.You're no longer her mother-in-law, and she has no obligation to listen to any of your criticisms or suggestions."

"What kind of logic is that?" Betty stared at me incredulously. "Marriage bonds can be dissolved, but how can family connections be so easily severed? From the moment she married you, she should forever respect the Baker family!"

I started the car and pulled away from the police station,feeling a wave of

exhaustion wash over me. "What exactly did you hope to accomplish by going to her workplace?"

"It was for Sarah's sake, of course!" Betty's voice was filled with righteous indignation. "Sarah is carrying your child and was publicly humiliated by Annie online. Not only did you fail to defend Sarah, but you allowed yourself to be insulted as well. I had to make Annie understand that the Baker family is not to be trifled with!"

My fingers tightened involuntarily around the steering wheel. This was precisely the issue-Sarah consistently managed to convince my mother that she was the innocent victim, while Annie was the unreasonable aggressor.


"Mom, I need to correct something," I struggled to keep my voice steady."Annie only retaliated because Sarah provoked her first. Have you considered why Annie would suddenly post that content online? It was because Sarah had already published defamatory statements about her."

Betty fell silent, though thetightness in her jawline told me she wasn't accepting my explanation.

"If you want a more peaceful life moving forward, you'd be wise to maintain some distance from Sarah," I continued. "She's been particularly provocative lately."


Betty immediately countered: "And you're just supposed to tolerate it?Philip,you've already lost Brian, and your only hope now rests with the child in Sarah's womb. If you don't treat her well and she gets upset enough to harm the baby, what will you do then? Find another wife and try for another child?"

I fell silent. My mother's words cut like a sharp knife, striking my most

vulnerable point. Since my relationship with Brian had deteriorated, I had indeed placed all my hopes on Sarah's unborn child. But lately, I'd found myself wondering-was this really the life I wanted?


"You need to understand that everything I do is for your benefit," Betty said, her tone softening as she noted my lack of response.

I suddenly realized that since divorcing Annie and getting involved with Sarah, my life had become chaotic. Each day was filled with arguments,suspicions, and various minor incidents. Initially, I had found this lifestyle stimulating, but now I found myself longing for the peaceful, warm days I'd shared with Annie.


"When it comes down to it, I think Annie is just inconsiderate and lacks class!" Betty continued complaining. "Society's consensus is that pregnant women deserve special consideration. But Annie-"

"What relation are you to Annie?" I interrupted.

Betty answered without hesitation: "Her former mother-in-law."

"So essentially, you have no relationship with her," I replied, my tone verging on sarcastic. "Why should she make allowances for you or Sarah?"

"But you're her ex-husband!" Betty exclaimed passionately. "She once loved you so much, valued you above her own life..."

Her words pierced my heart like a needle. Yes, Annie had once loved me deeply. She married me shortly after graduating from college, when her eyes held only me, treating me as her entire world. And how had I repaid her? With betrayal, deception, and ultimately taking away her son.

"But Mom,she doesn't love me anymore," I heard my voice grow somber. "She has Howard Thompson now, and..." I swallowed hard, "he's far better

than I am. She genuinely has no feelings for me anymore. If Sarah would simply stay home and focus on her pregnancy instead of causing troubole..."

"She doesn't even deign to speak with you," Betty finished my thought.her tone revealing clear disapproval. "How can she be so cold-hearted?How can someone completely let go of a man they once loved?"

I didn't contradict her, offering only a bitter smile. "Perhaps during those six years of marriage, her feelings for me had already faded. My entanglement with Sarah was simply the final push she needed to completely give up on our relationship."

"Fine, then." Betty remained unconvinced, but she recognized that pursuing the topic would only increase my frustration. For the remainder of the journey, we sat in silence, each absorbed in our own thoughts.

Back at home, I prepared two cups of tea, hoping to ease the tense atmosphere. Betty sat on the sofa, appearing much calmer.

"Mom, promise me you won't cause any more trouble for Annie, all right?"I handed her a cup of tea, speaking softly.

Betty accepted the tea and nodded perfunctorily, but her gaze had already shifted to a photograph of Brian on my desk. She set down her cup,walked over, and picked up the frame, her fingers gently tracing Brian's features.


"I haven't seen my darling grandson in quite some time," her voice suddenly became gentle. "How is he doing in school?"

"Fine," I answered, though my heart tightened. "He's been... busy lately."

In truth, I wasn't certain. Brian had almost stopped taking my calls and deliberately avoided being picked up by me.

Betty stared at the photograph, her expression becoming deep and complex."Such a bright child, truly inheriting the Baker family's excellent genes. I miss him terribly."

Her words seemed innocuous, but that intense focus in her expression gave me a sense of unease. I knew my mother too well-Betty Baker was not someone who conceded defeat easily. Today's setback at the police station clearly hadn't shaken her determination.


Perhaps my mother had simply shifted her strategy. If she couldn't confront Annie directly, maybe through Brian... perhaps she was already planning to use her grandson as a new point of leverage.

"Mom," I set down my tea, my voice carrying a warning. "Don't involve Brian in this."

Betty turned to me, her face displaying an innocent expression. "I'm simply missing my grandson. What's wrong with that?"

But I caught the shrewd glint in her eyes, and I knew this matter would never be as simple as she made it seem.
 
###Chapter 111: I'm Already Looking Forward to Next Time

Howard's POV

I placed the last signed document on the corner of my desk, completing today's work ahead of schedule. My mind drifted back to the conversation I'd had with Lucy this morning.

While Annie was still asleep, I had telling stories to Lucy. She had suddenly picked up a toy airplane from her collection, examining it with serious concentration before looking up at me with those inquísitive blue eyes.

"Why can airplanes fly?" she'd asked, her voice soft but clear.

Kids were so unpredictable.

I'd explained the basic principles of aerodynamics in simple terms-how the shape of wings creates lift, how engines provide thrust,and how the air pressure differences help keep the plane aloft. To my surprise, Lucy had been completely captivated, asking me at least a dozen follow-up questions,some so technical that even I couldn't provide complete answers.

"What happens if the air gets too thin?" "Why are some wings straight and others angled back?" "How do pilots know which buttons to press?"

The memory brought a smile to my face.

I picked up my phone and dialed the head of HR.

"Mr. Thompson, what can I do for you?" Susan's efficient voice came through.

"I need a science tutor for Lucy," I explained. "Someone with expertise in aerodynamics and physics, but who can teach at a child's level."

"T'll find someone right away," Susan assured me. "Any specific time requirements?"


"The sooner the better. Tonight would be ideal, if possible. Lucy and Penny will both benefit from it."

"Tll make it happen," she promised.

Once I'd arranged for Lucy's tutor, I headed over to Annie's office. I found her at her desk, brow furrowed in concentration as she sorted through several draft sketches for her romance comic series. She didn't notice me immediately, which gave me a moment to appreciate her focused expression-the slight bite of her lower lip, the intensity in her eyes as she assessed her own work.

I sat down in the chair opposite her desk. "What's on your mind?"


Annie looked up, momentarily startled before her expression softened."I've finished these comics, but I don't have accounts set up to publish them."

"Need some help?" I offered.


Annie hesitated, concern flashing across her face. "I was wondering if I could use your phone number to register some accounts. But if you think it might affect your image..."

Without a second thought, I pulled ouat my phone and handed it to her."Here,use it."


She stared at the device in surprise. "You're just giving me your phone like that?"

"Why wouldn't I?" I reached out to gently stroke her hair."You're my girlfriend, the person I want to spend my life with. I have nothing to hide from you."


Annie took the phone. I bet Philip had never allowed her to touch his phone during their six years of marriage.

"Thank you," she said softly.

"It's only right." I replied, leaning in to place a quick kiss on her lips.

Annie quickly set to work, her fingers moving efficiently across the screen as she registered accounts and uploaded her content. After a few minutes,she handed the phone back to me. "All done."

"That was fast," I commented, pocketing the device without even checking what she'd done. My trust in her was implicit.

"Do you think I should accept advertising offers?" Annie asked casually,organizing her sketches into neat piles.

"It would increase your revenue," I analyzed objectively, "but might affect merchandise sales."


Annie nodded thoughtfully. "Then I'l stick with merchandise sales for now."


"Why?" I asked, genuinely curious about her decision-making process.

"I'm using your account," she explained, her expression earnest. "If there's any issue with the advertisements, it could affect you. I don't want to cause you any problems."

"Merchandise sales will eventually plateau," I pointed out. "When that
ens. you'll have no income."

"Tll have savings by then,"Annie smiled, her eyes crinkling at the corners."I could take a break, focus on caring for Lucy." Her expression brightened further. "And whiletaking care of her, I might find new inspiration..."

"That makes sense," I agreed, appreciating her long-term thinking.

As we continued our conversation, I noticed Annie's gaze occasionally shifting away, as if she were contemplating something she was hesitant to voice.

"What is it?" I prompted.

Annie bit her lip before speaking. "Don't you think... you've been coming to my office too frequently lately? It might cause gossip."

I paused, taking a moment to understand her concern. "You're worried our relationship might affect work?"

"Yes, considering how many people work here," she explained.

I couldn't help but smile. "I thought you were saying we spend too much time together."


"What? No..." Annie's cheeks flushed. "That's not what I meant..."

"Now that you mention it though," I leaned closer, my voice dropping to a lower register, "I find myself wanting more time with you."

Annie's blush deepened, but she maintained a serious expression. "Howard,we're still at the office. We should maintain some professional boundaries."

"My company has always supported employees' freedom to meet their needs," I murmured near her ear. "Like taking necessary breaks."

Annie's breathing quickened slightly, her professional resolve visibly wavering. "At this time of day, everyonte's probably rushing to finish work before going home... the women's restroom should be empty."

"Why don't you check and see?" I suggested, struggling to maintain my composed exterior despite my growing anticipation.

Annie nodded and left the office. A few minutes later, I received a message confirming her assessment.

I walked unhurriedly toward the restroom, making sure no one was watching before entering and locking the door behind me. I proceeded to the furthest stall where Annie was waiting. The moment I saw her,standing there with anticipation written across her features, desire ignited within me.


"Every time I see you focused during meetings," I whispered near her ear,"I imagine pushing you onto the conference table."

Her face flushed immediately. "Howard!"

"Haven't you had similar thoughts?" My hands were already finding their way beneath her blouse.

"I..," her voicę trembled at my touch. "Sometimes I dream about you taking me on your desk."

The moment she made her candid confession, my desire ignited completely.I pressed her against the wall, eagerly capturing her lips with mine.Her response was equally passionate, her arms encircling mny neck as her entire body pressed against me.

I pinned her against the partition wall, my handssliding beneath the hem of her blouse to feel her skin, burning hot with desire. The moans

escaping her throat acted like an aphrodisiac, intensifying my senses.Seeing Annie-normally so confident and independent-now so sensitive and vulnerable beneath my touch ignited a powerful sense of possession within me.


Her fingers deftly unbuckled my belt. each touch making my desire increasingly difficult to contain. Though the space was small,it was perfect for keeping us pressed together without an inch of separation. Her skirt was pushed up as my fingers explored her most intimate area, feeling how ready she was for me.


"So you were worried about coming to the office too frequently," I deliberately whispered in her ear, "not about us doing this too frequently."

"Both... a little..." her words were interrupted by my touch, causing her to let out a soft gasp.

"But your body seems quite honest," my fingers circled gently at her sensitive spot. "it seems I haven't been trying hard enough if you still have energy to worry about such things."

"Howard..." she bit her lip, her voice carrying a plea.

"Is this how you show your gratitude?" I asked teasingly, though my fingers didn't cease their movements.

"How...how should I thank you?" she asked between breaths.

"Like this." I hesitated no longer and thrust into her body.

When we finally joined, we both released sighs of satisfaction. The confined space made every movement more intimate, every rhythm deeper.Her legs wrapped around my waist, her nails digging into my back,leaving her mark.

I gazed at her impassioned face, those eyes-usually so confident-now unfocused with pleasure, her lips parted,emitting suppressed gasps. The thought that this version of her belonged only to me caused the possessiveness within me to spead like wildfire.

"Annie..." I quickened the pace while kissing her lips, swallowing all her moans.


In this forbidden place, with the danger of someone entering at any moment, our senses were infinitely heightened. Every touch, every inch of skin friction brought unprecedented stimulation. I could feel her every contraction. every slight tremor, driving me increasingly wild.

When her body suddenly tensed, then violently trembled,I knew she had reached her peak. She bit down on my shoulder to prevent herself from making a sound. Her reaction completely demolished my last defenses,and I released as well.

"I'm already looking forward to next time," I confessed against her lips,knowing with absolute certainty that this desire would never fade. And I didn't want it to.
 
###Chapter 112: I Will Never Regret It

Philip's POV

After dropping my mother off at her house, I returned to my office. For several minutes, I simply stood in front of the windows, staring out as darkness began to fall.

I couldn't understand why I kept allowing Sarah to cause Annie pain.Each time Annie endured another unfair attack, she moved one step further away from me. The most painful realization was how deeply uncomfortable Annie's absence from my life had made me. I found myself wishing I could go back in time-I would leave Sarah, focus on creating a beautiful life with Annie, and be the husband she deserved.

But it was too late for regrets now.

A knock at the door interrupted my thoughts.

I quickly adjusted my expression. "Come in," I called out.

Ruth Miller burst into my office, her face red with anger. "Philip Baker,what is wrong with you?"

I immediately stood to greet her. Though Annie might have given up on me and Brian, her mother was still a connection to her. If I could make a good impression on Ruth, perhaps she would think I was worthwhile and convince Annie to reconcile with me.


I forced a smile. "Mom, please have a seat."

"Don't pretend to be cordial," Ruth said coldly. "I've moved into Brian's house-your and Annie's former home. That child needs someone to look after him."

I stared at her in surprise. "You've moved in?"

"I had to." Ruth's eyes blazed with fury, "because his father has completely abandoned his son! The boy is five years old, Philip! Five!"

I attempted to defend myself. "It's not that simple..."

"When you divorced my daughter and got together with Sarah," Ruth interrupted, raising her voice, "I convinced myself you had found true love,so I never criticized you."

The pain in her tone made me uncomfortable.

"I just thought Annie deserved better. Annie supported you when you had nothing, quietly helping you achieve the success you have today. And how did you repay her? As soon as you had money and your first love came back,you only had eyes for Sarah."

Though I knew Ruth despised me for this, she had always kept her feelings buried. Apparently, today she wasn't going to remain silent.

I quickly apologized. "Mom, I know I was wrong."

"Hmph!" Ruth wasn't a naive girl; she easily detected the insincerity in my tone."Do you really?"

I nodded solemnly. "Absolutely!"

"I don't believe you," Ruth responded coldly. "If you were truly sorry, you wouldn't continuously let Sarah manipulate you and neglect your own son!



I tried to defend myself. "Have you considered why I'm doing this?"Ruth's disgust at my attempt to excuse myself only intensified."Philip

Baker, whatever your reasons, neglecting a child who cannot take care of himself only proves one thing you're despicable."

"As for your romantic issues, I won't comment too much."

"The last time I saw Annie," Ruth suddenly said, with a hint of pride in her voice, "she looked completely different.".

My heart tightened slightly. "What do you mean?"

"She's no longer that depressed woman," Ruth looked directly into my eyes,
"she's very happy now, her face glowing with a radiance I haven't seen in years. She told me she has a good job at Howard Technologies and can fully support herself independently."

Ruth's lips curved slightly upward, "She says she's finally found her worth and peace. My daughter is more beautiful and stronger than before she left you."

I maintained my composure, but inside I was pierced by a sharp pain.Although I had already heard the news about Annie and Howard being together,hearing these details from her mother, confirming that she had truly moved on, was harder to bear than I had imagined. I had naively thought that Annie might still harbor some feelings for me, but that hope was now completely shattered. I remembered the woman who had once given everything for me, only for me to push her away with my own hands.


I lowered my head, trying to hide the pain flickering in my eyes.

I quickly tried to explain. "But there are reasons for all this. After Sarah and I got together, Brian was always causing problems..."

Ruth angrily slapped my desk. "Brian initially loved Sarah, I know that

very well," she said coldly. "He chose her over his own mother."

"Now you're telling me that as soon as Sarah started dating you,Brian mysteriously developed issues with her?"

"Have you completely lost your mind?"

Ruth's sharp words left me pale-faced.

Seeing my reaction, Ruth decided she had said enough. "I've made my position clear."

"You haven't been taking care of Brian or treating him well."

"When you're old and he doesn't want to support you, don't complain!"

I found Ruth's defense of Brian and criticism of me unbearable. "Rest assured. I won't complain," I responded tensely.

"Sarah is carrying my child," I continued. "Once this child is born, I'll leave all my assets to them. No need to trouble Brian."

Ruth sighed deeply, her eyes flashing with a moment of realization.

"You know," Ruth said slowly, her voice low and firm,"I originally didn't understand why Annie was so determined to leave you. But now I get it."She looked directly into my eyes, "If you can be so cold to your own child,what could Annie expect?"

Her words pierced my chest like a sharp blade. I was speechless because,to some extent, I knew she was right.

"Under these circumstances, record a video statement as evidence," Ruth suggested.

"In the video, state what year it is now, the size of your company, and its approximate annual profit. That way, when you grow old and seek Brian's support, he can simply show the video to everyone. It would prove that you abandoned him when you were making money. No one will blame Brian for refusing to care for such a father."Ruth continued: "Also mention your current age, Brian's current age, and clearly state that you've decided to stop supporting Brian and don't expect him to take care of you in the future."


Ruth added, "Once you do this and I have the video, I promise we won't bother you again. Don't worry-even if Brian needs money, I'll find a way to take care of him myself. I promise he will never ask you for money.How does that sound?"

I found Ruth's proposal absurd. I had only intended to teach Brian a lesson, expecting that once Brian ran out of money,he would recognize his mistake...

Then I would forgive him and restore his allowance.

But after Ruth's intervention...

I almost wanted to completely wash my hands of Brian.

I didn't immediately agree. "Are you sure about this?"

Ruth nodded firmly, with no hesitation in her gaze. "Yes, I'm absolutely certain."


If I record this video, I thought, Ruth might see that I'm willing to compromise. She could tell Annie that I've changed, that I'm more reasonable now. This might be my last chance to get Annie back.

I picked up my phone, pointed it at my face, and began recording.

After finishing, I sent the video directly to Ruth. "I hope you never regret this."


"Don't worry," Ruth answered after checking the video to ensure it contained all the content they had discussed. "I will never regret it."

As Ruth prepared to leave my office, she suddenly stopped,turned to look at me, with a certain determination in her eyes.

"Philip," she said quietly, "Ive decided to call Annie."

My heart suddenly accelerated, my palms beginning to sweat. "What are you going to tell her?"

Ruth's gaze fixed on me, her voice firm: "Everything. Everything that happened today. Including your plan to abandon Brian for Sarah's child."

"You can't do that!" I instinctively raised my voice, then forced myself to calm down. "It will hurt Brian..."

This wasn't what I thought it would be.

"Do you really care about hurting anyone, Philip?" Ruth questioned, "All you care about is yourself, nothing more."

She turned toward the door, but looked back one last time: "I want Annie to know she made the right decision. Leaving you was the wisest choice of her life."


With that, Ruth slammed the door shut.
 
###Chapter 113: New Office

Annie's POV

In my office. I was reviewing the final touches on a new children's book illustration when my phone suddenly vibrated. Glancing at the screen, I was surprised to see my mother's name lighting up the display.

I answered with a casual, "Hi, Mom."

"Annie," Ruth's voice came through, uncharacteristically urgent. "I need to apologize to you."

Her words caught me completely off guard. My mother was many things-practical, hardworking, direct-but rarely apologetic. I set down my pencil,giving her my full attention.

"Apologize? For what?"

"For not supporting your decision to divorce Philip," she said,her voice heavy with regret. "I've been too conservative, always thinking Philip was'not that bad' of a person. I discouraged you from leaving him."

I leaned back in my chair, momentarily speechless.

"What brought this on?" I finally asked.

"I just spoke with Philip," my mother explained, her tone hardening. "That man-he's not even human! How could he do this to you? To his own son?"


The vehemence in her voice startled me. "Mom,what happened?"

"He cheated on you with his first love, abandoned the wife who supported

him when he had nothing, took away your child, and now he's neglecting Brian!" Her words came in a rush of indignation. "And that mother of his-Betty-she doesn't care for Brian at all. All she cares about is Sarah and her unborn child!"


I remained silent, allowing her to express the anger she had apparently been containing.

"T've been blind," she continued, her voice softening slightly. "You made the right decision leaving that family. Annie. You were absolutely right."

A small smile formed on my lips. So they had finally shown their true colors to my mother as well. They had practically abandoned Brian-the child they had fought so hard to take from me-in favor of Sarah's unborn baby.

How they would regret this decision when they eventually discovered the child might not even be Philip's.

"Thank you for saying that, Mom," I replied, genuinely touched by her support,late though it was.


"I want you to know," she continued, "that whatever you decide to do from now on, I support you completely. You have my full backing."

"Thank you, Mom," I said again, feeling a weight I hadn't realized I was carrying lift from my shoulders.

"Don't be so formal with me," she said with a hint of her usual briskness."We're family. There's no need for all these thank-yous."

Before I could respond, she abruptly changed tone. "I need to go now.I have some things to arrange."

"Wait-" I began, but she had already ended the call.

I sat there for a moment, staring at my phone. The conversation had been unexpected but deeply gratifying. My mother's validation of my decision to leave Philip felt like the final piece of a puzzle falling into place.

My reflections were interrupted by a message notification.Howard had texted,asking me to come see his newly remodeled office. I frowned slightly in confusion-I was intimately familiar with Howard's office,having spent considerable time there, including some rather...unprofessional moments. What could be new about it?

Curiosity piqued, I made my way through the bustling corridors of Howard Technologies. The company was thriving, and the energy was palpable in every corner. As I approached Howard's office, I noticed subtle changes-the reception area had been extended, and there was a new door adjacent to his main entrance.

When I stepped inside. I gasped involuntarily.Howard's already spacious office had been expanded to nearly twice its original size. The familiar desk and leather chairs remained, but beyond them, through an elegant archway, was a completely new space.

Howard stood in the center of the room, his tall figure commanding as always, a rare smile playing on his lips as he watched my reaction.

"What do you think?" he asked, gesturing toward the addition.

I stepped further into the office, taking in the details. "It's...impressive.But what's that?" I pointed to the adjoining space.

"That," he said, guiding me through the archway, "is your creative space."

The new area was flooded with natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows.

In the center stood an adjustable drawing table, positioned to capture the best of the daylight. A comfortable chair was tucked neatly beneath it.Along one wall, shelves held an array of professional-grade markers.colored pencils, and various art supplies, all meticulously organized by color and type.

Display boards had been mounted on another wall,perfect for showcasing and reviewing works in progress. In a corner sat a small refrigerator,which Howard opened to reveal my favorite drinks and snacks.

"I thought you might prefer working here," Howard explained, watching my expression carefully. "Rather than in your separate office down the hall.11


I turned to him, surprise evident on my face. "You want me to share your office?"


"Is that a problem?" he asked, his voice level but his eyes searching mine.

"Won't people in the company talk?" I hesitated, thinking about the potential gossip this arrangement might generate.

"That's precisely the point," Howard replied with characteristic directness."
I want everyone in this company to know that you're my girlfriend."

I studied his face, sensing there was more to this than professional acknowledgment. "Is that the only reason?" I asked, a teasing glins in my eye.


Howard didn't shy away from my implication. "No," he admitted frankly."It also means we don't have to sneak around when we want to be... close."

"Howard Thompson!" I exclaimed, feigning shock at his brazenness.But inwardly, I was drawn to this combination of authority and candor-the

way he could be so commanding yet so transparent about his desires.

I couldn't help but reflect on how different this was from my marriage to Philip. Philip had always maintained appearances,saying what was proper rather than what was true. Howard, by contrast, was unapologetic about his feelings and intentions. There was something thrilling about that honesty.


"So?" Howard prompted, bringing me back to the present. "Will you accept this arrangement?"

Looking around at the thoughtfully designed space-a place created specifically with my needs and comfort in mind-I found myself nodding."Yes. I accept."

The satisfaction in Howard's eyeswas immediate. It struck me again how different this relationship was from my previous one. Philip had always viewed my illustrating as a hobby, somnething to be tolerated rather than celebrated. Howard not only encouraged my professional development but took pride in it, creating space for my work within his own domain.

I was part of his life, his present, and his future. This idea meant a great deal.

A knock at the door interrupted our moment.

"Come in," Howard called.

Susan Moore, Howard's efficient secretary, entered holding a tablet. "I have updates on Ms. Baker's comic publication, Mr. Thompson."

"Go ahead," Howard nodded, gesturing for her to continue.

Susan turned to me with a pleased expression. "The printing details for

the physical versions of your comics have been finalized. The books should be published within the next few months."

"That was fast," I remarked, genuinely surprised by the efficient timeline.

"The publishing market for physical books hasn't been doing well recently,"Susan explained. "Publishers haven't had any bestsellers lately. When they saw how quickly your merchandise sales were growing, they believed your books could help them turn a profit. They've prioritized your work, which has accelerated the production process."

She scrolled through her tablet before continuing, "We've also hired staff to coordinate with international publishers. They're interested in your books and are willing to handle everything with a standard profit-sharing arrangement."

I couldn't help but appreciate how pleasant it was working at Howard Technologies. I could focus entirely on my creative work while others handled the business aspects with remarkable efficiency. This level of support would have been unimaginable during my time with Philip.

"Do you have any objections to these arrangements, Mr.Thompson?"Susan asked,turning to HIoward.

"None," he replied simply.

Susan nodded, then paused slightly before adding, "That's all the good news. Now for the bad news."


My head snapped up in surprise. What? Bad news?
 
###Chapter 114: Bad News

Annie's POV

"So, what's the bad news?" I asked, looking at Susan, curiosity and a touch of uneasiness intertwining in my chest.

Susan's expression turned hesitant. her lips pressed together slightly."
There's a newly released web comic with storylines significantly similar to your work."


I raised an eyebrow, not understanding the problem. This was common in the creative industry, as long as it wasn't direct plagiarism...

"But..." Susan continued, her voice noticeably lowered, "it contains numerous defamatory elements about you and Mr. Thompson."

My heart suddenly accelerated, an ominous feeling washing over me.

"It claims Annie had an affair during her marriage, and that Mr.Thompson was the third party..." Susan's gaze dropped,clearly finding the subject difficult to broach. "The comic insinuates that Philip was completely the deceived party, that he only decided to divorce you after discovering your secret relationship."

I felt my blood freeze instantly, then rapidly heat up. Anger and disbelief surged through me simultaneously-this completely reversed the facts! A painful memory flashed through my mind: the night I found Philip betray me,and the heartbreak and struggle that followed.

I took a deep breath, trying to calm my intense emotions, my fingers unconsciously tapping against the edge of the drawing table. I pulled out my phone and quickly searched for the comic Susan had mentioned.

As I quickly scanned the content, it felt like a stone was pressing against my chest. Every frame was a distortion of reality, every dialogue inverting black and white. In this comic. Sarah was portrayed as an innocent victim,while I was a morally bankrupt betrayer.

"Some people have already placed the two comics side by side for comparison," Susan continued, "which has caused many to develop negative opinions about you. Some have even left insulting comments in your comment section."


I felt a sting, but it was followed by a strange calmness. This wasn't the first time, was it? Sarah seemed to possess endless energy to defame me,and I was tired of repeatedly becoming a victim in her games.

"Mr. Thompson," Susan turned to Howard, "do we need to issue a clarifying statement?"

I looked up at Howard, whose expression remained as calm as ever, his deep eyes turning to me. "What do you think?"

I didn't answer immediately, instead asking, "If we don't clarify, will it affect the company's stock price?"

"No," Susan quickly responded, "If such obviously fabricated stories could affect Howard Technologies' stock price, then investors would be too easily deceived."


I relaxed slightly, feeling my shoulders ease a bit. "If there's no impact,then we don't need to clarify," I said, my voice surprisingly calm.

Howard raised an eyebrow slightly. "Aren't you afraid of criticism?"

I met his gaze, feeling a deep wave of fatigue wash over me-not toward Howard, but toward this endless entanglement. "When I was first

suddenly attacked, I did feel wronged," I said honestly. "I thought. 'I haven't done anything wrong, why am I being treated this way?"

I recalled the betrayal by Philip and Brian, the accusations.

"But later I understood," I continued, "these people aren't my friends,they don't know the truth at all. It's normal for them to be influenced by public opinion." I looked directly into Howard's eyes, feeling the strength his concern and understanding gave me. "In this situation, what I need to do is be clear about who I am, what I want, rather than living in others'judgments."

"If what they're saying isn't true," my voice grew more resolute, "then there's no need to take it to heart."

Though I appeared calm on the surface, the anger toward Sarah was quietly burning inside me. She was always like this, constantly trying to destroy the life I had rebuilt, as if seeing me find happiness was unbearable to her. This time, I wouldn't let her succeed.

Susan gave me a thumbs up. "An impressive attitude."

"Thank you," I responded, then began analyzing the current situation."Because this comic attacks me, readers curious about what kind of person I am will comè to follow me, even check out my work..." My thoughts began racing rapidly, a plan forming in my mind. "If they start reading and suddenly discover mycomics are actually valuable?"

My lips curved slightly upward. "Couldn't I use this to guide them to purchase my merchandise? Even if they just want to criticize me, they'll come to my comment section, increasing my traffic."

"Most importantly," I continued, feeling my confidence growing, "I've

already responded to similar issues in the comment section. There are definitely readers who know I'm innocent in this matter. If they defend me,those who criticized me might purchase some merchandise out of guilt."

Susan looked at me in surprise. "You can even turn criticism against you into an advantage-your thinking pattern is really special."

"What happened has happened," I shrugged, "what use is crying and complaining?"

Susan turned to Howard. "So, sir, should I inform the PR department not to respond to this issue?"

"Yes," Howard calmly answered. His surface composure reassured me,knowing I had him as a solid support gave me tremendous strength.

I lowered my head, my thoughts flowing like an undercurrent. Sarah truly will never leave me alone.

But then, a thought flashed in my mind. If I don't respond now, people will think Sarah is truly as kind and sincere as she appears in the comic...People will begin to like her,support her.

But when her true face is finally revealed... I bit my lower lip, how will public opinion reverse? What severe backlash will she face? When people discover they've been deceived, manipulated, how much anger will they direct at Sarah?

At that time, I'll only need to stand at a distance and watch it all unfold.Who told Sarah she could always attack me through public opinion without paying a price? What she doesn't know is that I've already secretly prepared my counterattack.

I wasn't backing down, but waiting for the most appropriate time to strike

back. Since Sarah had chosen this way to confront me, I wouldn't be soft-hearted anymore.


After Susan finished giving instructions to the PR department, she suddenly remembered something. "Oh, Mr. Thompson, Caroline Gluck has applied to produce merchandise for this comic."

Howard raised an eyebrow, his expression subtly changing.

Susan added, "This comic was drawn by Sarah."

Hearing that name, I felt nauseated. Sarah not only wanted to defame me but also profit from it?

Howard's expression became incredulous. "She's clearly in the wrong,yet she spreads rumors about Annie and me in her comic, and now she even wants me to help her produce merchandise?" His voice carried a rare coldness. "Do I look that easy to bully?"

His protective nature warmed my heart. Philip had never defended me like this; no matter what Sarah said or did, he always chose to stand by or worse-blame me for overreacting.

"So should I directly reject Caroline's request?" Susan asked.

Howard analyzed calmly: "When Sarah's true nature is finally exposed,those who originally supported her and purchased merchandise will feel deceived. If we actually produced the merchandise, and later everyone demands refunds, wouldn't we be bearing all the losses?"

Susan nodded. "Indeed. I'll notify Caroline immediately."

Howard's gaze lingered on me for a moment, his expression softening imperceptibly. "Annie, are you sure you're alright with this?"

I nodded, mustering a small smile. "I'm fine. I've dealt with worse from Sarah before."


It was true compared to having my son turned against me, a defamatory comic was almost insignificant. Almost.

"I'd like to see this comic," Howard stated, his tone businesslike but with an undercurrent of concern.


I handed him my phone, the offensive comic still displayed on the screen.As Howard scrolled through it, his jaw tightened almost imperceptibly, the only visible sign of his displeasure.

"The artwork is mediocre at best," he commented after a moment, his critical assessment somewhat comforting.

"And the narrative structure is weak. It won't hold interest for long."

"You're right," I agreed, taking back the phone. "People might be drawn in by the scandal initially, but they'll quickly lose interest if the quality isn't there."


"Precisely," Howard nodded. "And when they compare it to your work..."

"They'll see the difference," I finished his thought, feeling a little lighter.

Susan, who had been observing our exchange with interest, cleared her throat. "Mr. Thompson, I have the quarterly reports ready for your review.Would you like me to leave them here?"

Howard nodded. "Yes, thank you, Susan."

As Susan prepared to leave, she paused at the door. "For what it's worth,Ms. Baker, I've read your comics, and I think they're excellent. My niece is

a huge fan of your children's books,too."

Her unexpected support brought a genuine smile to my face. "Thank you.Susan. That means a lot."
 
###Chapter 115: Carefree

Annie's POV

As Susan disappeared through the doorway, I found myself still mulling over the "bad news" she had just shared.


Howard closed the office door quietly and returned to my side, settling into the chair beside me. His thumb gently stroked the back of my hand, a small gesture of comfort that had become familiar between us.

"Your merchandise is selling remarkably well," Howard said, his voice deep and calm. "Now people in the comic industry and other circles are starting to imitate your approach."

"That's actually a good thing," I replied, my fingers idly tracing the lines on my drawing tablet. "It helps cultivate readers' awareness about supporting original content. It means our merchandise will sell even better in the future."

Howard tilted his head slightly, his eyes studying me with a searching look.
"Doesn't it bother you that Sarah is copying your methods?"

"As long as she's not causing trouble for no reason, I don't care what she does." I shrugged, feeling his arm tighten almost imperceptibly around my shoulders.

"She'll definitely continue to stir up problems," he said, his voice carrying a hint of concern. "And now that Caroline has seen the profit potential, she'll become jealous too. They might resort to underhanded tactics for those resources and opportunities."

I could feel the concern in Howard's eyes, his desire to shield me from any

harm. The feeling was both warming and unfamiliar-Philip had never cared about my feelings like this.

My chest tightened as I realized I was comparing Howard to Philip again.Why did I keep thinking about Philip? Was it because of Betty and Sarah's constant harassment lately? How ridiculous. I needed to stop making these comparisons. I was divorced now, and Howard was so much better than Philip ever was. The past should remain in the past; I couldn't let those unpleasant memories continue to affect my current life.

"Don't worry," I patted his hand reassuringly. "These minor issues won't affect me. No matter how much trouble they create, it won't impact my ability to earn money."

Howard's expression visibly relaxed, the tension around his eyes dissipating. "If that's how you see it, then that's good."

"Since you know Caroline and Sarah aren't good people, why not just fire Caroline directly?"

Howard and I both turned to see Catherine standing in my drawing area,curiously examining the drafts hanging on the wall. She was dressedin a vibrant business outfit, a coffee cup in hand.

"When did you come in?" Howard asked, a trace of surprise in his voice.

"Just as your secretary was leaving," Catherine answered honestly. She walked closer to my drawing table, running her fingers lightly over the neatly arranged colored pens. "Wow, these are professional grade! Annie.your new office is amazing!"

I laughed. "I didn't even notice you come in."

Catherine spun around, addressing Howard: "This space is much bigger
than l imagined. Annie, you're so lucky to have such large windows." She pointed at the floor-to-ceiling windows. "The lighting is perfect."

Howard didn't respond, simply watching as Catherine inspected my workspace.


Catherine quickly returned to our previous topic: "So, why not fire Caroline? Wouldn't that solve the problem at its source?"

"That's a good idea," Howard said, "but have you considered one important issue?"

"What?" Catherine's attention drifted away from my sketchbook.

"If we keep them under surveillance, we'll always know what they're planning." Howard explained. "If they leave, we won't be able to predict or respond to their actions."

Catherine nodded thoughtfully, her fingers tapping lightly against her chin."That makes sense."

Howard added, "Plus, with Caroline in the comnpany, I can assign her work,see through her intentions, and even figure out who might be supporting her behind the scenes."

Catherine's eyes lit up. "Ah! I get it now!" She looked like someone who had suddenly comprehended the complexities of the adult world.

As the conversation concluded, Howard turned to his computer to handle some work. I seized the opportunity to ask Catherine, "How's your new department?"

At the mention of this, Catherine's expression immediately crumbled. She dramatically flopped onto the sofa.′′It′Ss exhausting! Working from dawn

till dusk without a moment's rest! The only time I can slack off is during meals."

She turned toward Howard. "Isn't your company known for high salaries and great benefits? How can such a place exist?"

"That's because all the workaholics are in that department." Howard replied calmly. "They say they don't need salary increases; they just want to work intensely. I told them half the project's profits would be distributed as bonuses, and they ended up working even harder."

Catherine's expression changed instantly. She unconsciously sat up straighter, her eyes sparkling. I could see her mindset had completely shifted.


"Will I get a share of the bonus too?" she asked with a sweet smile.

"Of course, you're a department member," Howard answered,the corner of his mouth turning up slightly.

Catherine perked up immediately. "So when I get the money, I can spend it lavishly,right?"

I only heard Howard sigh softly, obviously thinking Catherine might not even have time to spend this money.

"If the benefits are so good, why doesn't anyone want to join your department?" I asked curiously.

"The project isn't guaranteed to be profitable," Howard explained. "Most people think the existing salary and benefits are good enough and dlon't want to take risks."

Catherine now had dollar signs practically visible in her eyes. "Can't they

imagine the project might be hugely successful?"

"There are no similar games on the market. The risk is indeed too high."Howard said.


"I see," Catherine nodded. "But I like taking risks."

With that, she sat down beside me, grabbed my arm, and leaned against my shoulder. Her expression became subtle, and I could sense she had something she wanted to say.

"What is it?" I asked with a smile.

"Annie," she began, her tone filled with displeasure, "do you remember that man who was pursuing me? The one who, after I rejected him, went and found a woman who looked just like me?"
 
###Chapter 116: Telling Her to Die?

Annie's POV

I sat in my new office, watching Catherine pace back and forth in front of me as our conversation continued.


"I remember that guy. What happened with him?" I asked, curiosity evident in my voice.

Catherine's brow furrowed slightly, her eyes reflecting clear displeasure."He's been going to my father every day, claiming there are issues with the Morgan family company. He says if my father arranges for me to marry him. he'll 'generously' help solve this 'crisis."

She rolled her eyes dramatically. "It's absurd! He's nothing but an idle.spoiled rich kid. How could he possibly help my father?"

Howard glanced at me,his expression calm but attentive. I could tell he was listening carefully despite appearing focused on his work.

I couldn't help but find Catherine's obvious disdain amusing. "Then what happened?"


Catherine sighed, her fingers lightly tapping against her coffee cup. "You can't imagine how strange he is! On one hand, he's desperately trying to convince my father to agree to our marriage. On the other hand, he's still entangled with his girlfriend who looks like me. I truly admire their dedication to this madness."

I tilted my head, asking with confusion, "He's still in contact with his girlfriend?"

Catherine wrinkled her nose slightly, her expression somewhat disgusted.

Yes! I don't know what twisted game they're playing..."

She paused, brushed a strand of hair aside, then continued,"Later I heard he tried to break up with his girlfriend.

She told him that if he didn't want her anymore, life would have no meaning, so she attempted suicide."

"A friend who witnessed the whole thing said it was quite touching.They embraced and cried, sharing their deepest feelings. All the bystanders were heartbroken." Catherine's voice was fuIl of sarcasm. "I might have found their little story moving if they hadn't mentioned me."

I was genuinely confused, my brow involuntarily furrowing. "What does any of this have to do with you?"

"That's exactly what I can't figure out!" Catherine lifted her hands slightly,her tone carrying bewilderment. "So I asked my friend who was there what he said while holding his 'poor girlfriend'..."

Her voice turned mocking as she quoted him: "'Catherine Morgan, if it weren't for you, my girlfriend wouldn't have tried to harm herself. So from today on, don't expect you can have peace either."

Catherine explained that when she heard this, she was completely baffled and wanted to curse them out. It was one thing for them to stage a dramatic love story, but why drag in someone who had exited theisocial circle,focused on work, and didn't even maintain contact with them?

Catherine frowned and asked, "Are they mentally unstable?"

"They must be," Iagreed,nodding.

Howard had been listening quietly, seeming surprised that such strange

people actually existed.

Catherine appeared to relax slightly due to our agreement. "I think so too."She continued her story: "My father told me that very night, this guy called him and went on about how my father had failed as a father because he raised me to become..." she hesitated before quoting again, "'a cruel woman who doesn't value human life.' And that my father would pay for it."

My body instinctively leaned forward, my gaze immediately focusing on Catherine's face as I quickly asked with concern, "How did your father respond?"

"He recorded the call and sent it to the guy's father," Catherine said with satisfaction. "Then my father completely blocked him."

I thoughtfully rubbed my chin, my brow slightly furrowed,my gaze a bit unfocused as I tried to understand this strange situation."Are they playing some kind of role-playing game?"

"They can play whatever game they want," Catherine dismissed with disdaín. "The ridiculous part is that I'm minding my own business at home,so how did I mysteriously become the villain in their love drama?"

Catherine explained that if she were like Sarah-constantly messaging men,pretending to be fragile-she could understand why they might dislike her. Or if she claimed disinterest but maintained regular contact, their hostility would make sense. But the reality was, she hadn't done anything at all!

"It's ridiculous," I agreed, shaking my head slowly but firmly, my fingers unconsciously drawing small circles on the table surface.

Howard, who had been listening to our conversation casually, suddenly asked. "When he made these threats, did he mention how he planned to deal with your father?"


Catherine shook her head. "I don't know. My father didn't tell me."

"He always says I'm still young and shouldn't worry about company matters," she explained, her tone carrying a hint of affection. "I know he wants me to be his carefree little girl forever."

Her expression softened as she mentioned her loving parents. "My current plan is to focus on the project I'm involved in. If it launches successfully, I'Il make a lot of money! That way, even if my father's company really faces issues, I'll be able to support my parents."

Catherine's eyes sparkled with pride. "My father may have never imagined his daughter could be so capable and independent."

I smiled and gently patted her shoulder, my eyes reflecting admiration,impressed by her determination. "You've grown so much in just a few days. Your parents would be happy to see this. And I've started earning money recently too, so if you need financial assistance, let me know. I'll help as much as I can."

"Thank you," Catherine responded emotionally, her eyes slightly glistening as she threw herself into my embrace. "You're so good. I love you."

"Mmm," I murmured, the corners of my mouth turning up slightly as I patted her back gently.

Catherine reluctantly added, "I heard that strange couple is still trying to cause trouble for me. I hope we don't run into them tonight."

Howard, having finished his work, stood up. "Let's go have dinner."

l also rose from my seat. "Let's go."

The three of us headed downstairs to the restaurant and found a table.The waiter had just taken our menus, and Catherine was telling us about the progress of her department's project.

At that moment, a man's jarring voice suddanly cut through the restaurant's atmosphere.


"Catherine Morgan!" The voice was aggressive, each syllable filled with hostility. "You claim you don't like me, so why are you targeting her? Why did you message her saying she stole your man? Tellingher to die?"

I turned toward the source of the voice to see a young man in a well-tailored suit standing not far away, beside a tearful young woman.The entire restaurant suddenly fell silent, alleyes focusing on our table.
The Betrayed Wife's Revenge:Marrying the CEO
###Chapter 117: She's My Girlfriend, Not My Property

Catherine's POV

Annie, Howard, and I had just come down from the office to the company restaurant. We found a table and settled in, the waiter having just taken our menus. I was enthusiastically telling them about the progress of my department's project when a jarring voice cut through the restaurant's pleasant atmosphere.

"Catherine Morgan!"

I immediately looked up to see the nightmare-inducing figure of Bill White-an utterly unremarkable man with nondescript brown hair,average height, and wearing an expensive suit that somehow failed to look impressive on him. His face wore that self-important expression I'd grown to despise as he stood in the center of the restaurant, pointing accusingly at me.


"You claim you don't like me, so why are you targeting her? Why did you message her saying she stole your man? Telling her to die?" he shouted,his voice filled with baseless anger.

Behind him, I spotted a small figure-Grace Brown, a girl who perpetually looked like a victim, her frail shoulders slightly hunched as if abways prepared to absorb a blow. Her lackluster brown hair hung limply at her shoulders, and tears had already soaked her cheeks. She cowered behind Bill White as if I were some terrifying beast.

The entire restaurant fell silent instantly, all eyes focusing on our table.I felt utterly annoyed-my luck today was truly abysmal.
 

"Bill White," I said, trying to control my tone, "I'd like to know exactly when this alleged message was supposedly sent?"

Bill White answered without hesitation: "Yesterday at four in the afternoon.
0

I couldn't help but roll mny eyes. This was beyond ridiculous.

Howard glanced at me, then calmly addressed Bill White: "Would you mind if I commented on this matter?"

Bill White seemed surprised that Howard would involve himself but nodded. "Go ahead."

"Regarding that specific time you mentioned..." Howard continued casually,
"Catherine was recently transferred to the busiest department in our company."

Bill White, believing Howard was merely defending me,retorted,"Just because she's been transferred to a new department means she can't use her phone?"

"Actually, yes," Howard replied, his voice impressively calm. "To prevent employees from using their phones during work hours and affecting productivity, her department confiscates phones as soon as employees enter the office."

Bill White's brow furrowed deeply, clearly showing that his conviction was wavering.

Howard continued, "So it would have been impossible for her to send any messages."

"She's your employee, of course you'd defend her," Bill White said

resentfully, though with notably less confidence.

Howard maintained his composure, "If you don't believe me, you're welcome to tour their department and see for yourself whether what I'm saying is true."


I appreciated Howard's explanation, but I couldn't contain myself any longer. "Bill White, all your accusations are based on one assumption-that I have any interest in you," I stared directly into his eyes."But the truth is, I have absolutely no interest in you, never have, and never will."

I felt I needed to make things even clearer, my voice unconsciously rising:"Why would I view her as competition and target her? What would be my motivation? Honestly, seeing you two together only makes me feel relieved-relieved that I never had any relationship with you!"

I noticed Grace Brown flinch at my words, hiding further behind Bill White as if I might lunge across the room to harm her. Her pitiful demeanor only intensified my frustration. These two people weren't just making me the villain in their private role-playing drama, but now had the audacity to stage it publicly!

"Howard is right," I emphasized firmly, "I absolutely do not have the time or interest to deal with this nonsense!"

Bill White turned to Grace Brown and asked, "How do you explain this?"

Grace Brown's eyes darted nervously, and she suggested in an almost inaudible voice, "Maybe... someone used her phone to send me those messages?"

I couldn't believe she was still refusing to admit the truth even now. "First of all," I raised my voice, "I don't even have your phone number!"

"Second!" I continued without pausing, feeling my patience rapidly evaporating. "You're not some celebrity-nobody in my circle knows who you are. Why would anyone I know randomly message you?"

I felt I had to make things clear: "You two showing up here with these absurd accusations-people who know the situation might think you're just flaunting your relationship, but others would think you've conspired to harass me!"


My words seemed to have a significant impact on Grace Brown, whose tears started flowing more freely, her shoulders trembling slightly.

Bill White immediately turned to embrace her, as if protecting her from my "attack." When Grace Brown calmed down slightly, he turned to glare at me, "Even if you didn't do it, couldn't you be a little kinder? Look how upset you've made her!"

I felt my eyes nearly rolling to the back of my head. "The fact that I haven't walked over and slapped both of you demonstrates how patient I'm being," I replied. "Bill White, I don't know what game you two are playing, but let me be clear: you two might not have jobs, but I do."

"I don't have time for your relationship theatrics, and I certainly don't appreciate being used as a scapegoat in your relationship. Please stop dragging me into your personal affairs!" I was surprised by the firmness in my own voice.

"I've even stopped attending social events where you might be present, just to maintain distance from you. Isn't that enough to make my position clear?" I truly couldn't understand why they were being so obstinate.

Bill White's expression darkened, "Are you absolutely certain you never had feelings for me?"

I was inwardly grateful that I'd never developed any genuine feelings for Bill White; otherwise. I would have found myself in an even more indefensible position.

"If I truly loved you, why would I pursue Howard instead of you?" I responded confidently.

Bill White shifted his gaze to Howard, seemingly seeking some reaction from him.

Howard replied with perfect composure: "Because I'm exceptional."

I mentally applauded Howard's response as I continued my explanation:"Later, when Howard rejected me, I discovered his girlfriend Annie is amazing, and I've been spending all my time with her..."

"Did I come looking for you? I think my intentions were quite clear."

At this point, Grace Brown finally gathered the courage to speak, her voice small and trembling: "Maybe you thought this strategy would make him love you more?"

I almost laughed out loud. I was prepared for strange responses, but Grace Brown's comment still shocked me.

Annie calmly interjected:"So you think completely disappearing from someone's life and cutting all contact is actually a strategyto play hard to get?"

Grace Brown nodded firmly, the most decisive gesture I'd seen from her:"Yes,exactly."

"If that's your belief..." Annie suggested gently, "then why not try the same approach? Just as Catherine doesn't contact Bill White,you shouldn't

contact Catherine either. Wouldn't that make Bill White love you more?"

Grace Brown seemed at a loss for how to respond,opening and closing her mouth.


Annie continued, "That way, you could also make Bill White fall more deeply in love with you,right?"

"I can easily promise not to contaet him for several years," I added.fighting the urge to laugh.

Annie smiled at Grace Brown, "You hear that? If Catherine has this strategy and determination that keeps Bill White thinking about her,shouldn't you learn from her? Wouldn't that make Bill White love you more?"


Grace Brown's face grew even paler, and she looked uneasily at Bill White,seemingly unsure how to respond.

Bill White, moved by Grace Brown's tearful appearance,puffed out his chest and adopted a protective stance: "Are you two ganging up to bully a vulnerable woman? Does bullying make you feel powerful?"

"We were just here to have lunch," Annie calmly corrected him. "You two approached us with unfounded accusations, and we're simply defending ourselves."

"And..." she continued, "I was justfollowing your girlfriend's logic. If you find my response too sharp, doesn't that suggest you see flaws in your girlfriend's reasoning?"

Annie smiled pleasantly, with a confident and composed demeanor that I genuinely admired.
 

Unable to answer Annie's question, Bill White turned to Howard and changed the subject: "Mr. Thompson. don't you think your woman's loud behavior in public is quite inappropriate?"


"She's my girlfriend, not my property." Howard replied coolly."I don't need her to be dependent on me."

Howard's response made me mentally cheerfor him. Looking at Bill White and Grace Brown's embarrassed expressions. I suddenly found this absurd confrontation somewhat amusing.
 
###Chapter 118: That's the Advantage of Yout

Howard's POV

I met Bill White's gaze directly, responding to his comment about Annie's "inappropriate" behavior: "She's my girlfriend, not my property. I don't need her to be dependent on me. She has the right to her own emotions.I don't interfere. And everything she just said was entirely appropriate."

After speaking. I glanced at Annie. Those clear eyes of hers sparkled with independence and determination. This was precisely what I admired about her-she was a woman with her own opinions, capable of thinking independently and expressing herself freely. Unlike those women who needed a man's backing before daring to speak, Annie had her own confidence and principles.

Bill White's face quickly changed from red to white, his mouth twitching slightly as he unconsciously loosened his tie. He straightened his back like a middle school student whose proposal had been rejected, putting on an air of disdain while his eyes darted uncertainly. Irritated, he grabbed Grace's wrist, his grip so tight that Grace let out a soft hiss of pain.

"Since you're all being so unreasonable, we have nothing more to discuss,"he said.

"You interrupt our meal, come looking for trouble, and then blame us.That's quite a skill," I responded with a cold smile. I noticed Bill White's shoulders flinch slightly, but he immediately straightened his back,trying hard to maintain his dignity in front of Grace.

"Mr. Thompson, I'm just trying to get justice for my girlfriend," Bill White said irritably, his thumb anxiously rubbing his cufflink while his eyes slid sideways toward Catherine, clearly viewing her as an easy target.
 h

People like him were truly annoying. I'd encountered too many such characters in the business world completely lacking in ability yet always maintaining a superior attitude. The way his eyes shifted told me he didn't even believe his own words. More ridiculous was his apparent belief that I would yield to preserve his pitiful self-esteem.

"Catherine has already explained clearly that she never did what you accused her of. You're wrongly accusing her," I stated calmly.

Bill White made a contemptuous sound through his nose. "But I believe my girlfriend wouldn't lie."

How absurd. To maintain such ridiculous stubbornness in the face of clear evidence-this wasn't loyalty but stupidity. I began to wonder whether he truly lacked basic judgment or was deliberately putting on a show for Grace.


"Belief doesn't equal truth. The evidence is right in front of you, but you choose not to believe it," I replied.

Bill White tightened his jaw. "Since Mr. Thompson is determined to protect his company's employee, I'll say no more. Come on,Grace,let's go."He turned dramatically, pulling Grace along. She stumbled after him, the tears on her faceflowing more fiercely as if a switch had been turned on,while her eyes secretly glanced around to gauge others' reactions.

I watched their retreating figures with an inward cold laugh. The way Bill White concluded this farce also matched his character perfectly-pushing all responsibility onto others, then departing as if he were the victim.Grace's pretense of pitiful helplessness was even more unpleasant, her tears seemingly a weapon she could deploy at will. This couple, living in their self-woven web of lies, was quite well-matched indeed.
 h

As they disappeared from view, Catherine visibly relaxed. "I hope after today's incident, they'll dislike me enough to never bother me again."

"You should still be careful," I warned her. "Bill White's feelings for Grace aren't deep enough yet. She'H continue speaking ill of you to him, claiming you're persecuting her. This way, he'll view you as the villain and her as the victim, feeling more sympathy for her and greater aversion toward you.
11

Catherine covered her face with both hands. "When will she ever stop?This is an absolute nightmare! I haven't done anything, yet I've become the villain in their love story."

"She probably won't stop," I analyzed. "Whenever they have conflicts,they'Il use you as an excuse. This not only helps them reconcile quickly but also ensures their relationship remains intact. For them, it's completely beneficial with no downsides."

"They can say whatever they want, as long as they don't come directly to bother me, I don't care," Catherine reluctantly conceded, though her brow remained furrowed, her fingers tapping anxiously on the table.

"They'll definitely continue to frequently cause you trouble."

Catherine looked up, her eyes suddenly brightening. "Mr. Thompson,could I work at the company 24 hours a day? I could live in the office, so Bill White wouldn't be able to find me!"

"No,you can't. Our company doesn't allow such intense overtime,"I answered decisively.

Catherine's expression fell as if she'd been doused with cold water. "I understand."
 h

Annie looked at me. "Logically speaking, Bill White comes from a good family background. Shouldn't he have the ability to resolve conflicts with his girlfriend on his own? He can't possibly come to bother Catherine every day,can he?"

I turned to Annie, my voice softening. "Think about the type of people in their social circle."


"Useless people!" Catherine immediately exclaimed, hitting the table forcefully. "I see it clearly now. What kind of people are in that circle? Idle all day,only caring about designer brands and parties. Fortunately,I've already distanced myself from that circle. Especially after Bill White caused me trouble, I'm truly grateful I escaped."

"Exactly," I nodded. "Successful people wouldn't associate with them,and they can't connect with wealthy second-generation individuals of good character. Those who remain in that circle are ill-mannered but arrogant rich kids. Their parents indulge them, their friends flatter them, and their personalíties inevitably become tyrannical and unreasonable. When faced with problems, they never analyze the real issue, acting like headless flies,blindly charging ahead when used as weapons."

"I'm so grateful I'm no longer mixing with them. Otherwise,I would eventually be assimilated and become a brainless fool," Catherine said,picking up a napkin and firmly wiping the corner of her mouth.

"Considering these factors, my conclusion is that the possibility of Bill White being instigated to cause trouble in the future is very high," I said,noticing a flash of fear in Catherine's eyes.

"But don't worry. Since you work at our company, I'll definitely find a way to help you solve this problem," I added.
 h

"Really? Thank you so much!" Catherine said excitedly, light returning to her eyes.


"Absolutely," I nodded firmly.

I noticed Annie observing me, approval in hergaze. I turned to meet her eyes. taking her hand in mine. Just then, the,waiter arrived with our food.

Catherine checked the time, her eyes lighting up. "Mr. Thompson, could I have my meal packed to take back to the office? To show my gratitude, I've decided to return immediately and continue working, not wasting any more time! I want Bill White to hear only 'Sorry, Miss Morgan is busy with an important project' the next time he comes!"

"Of course." I gestured for the waiter to pack Catherine's food.

Catherine soon received her packed meal and stood to say goodbye."You two enjoy your meal. I'm going back to work! I won't be intimidated by those workaholics. I'll be the most dedicated one in the department!"

Watching Catherine leavefull of energy, Annie looked at me with a smile."You were really great just now. You defended your employee's rights without excessive interference, giving Catherine confidence to solve her problem."

"Isn't it amazing how quickly she recovered?" I asked.

"Yes, she was angry just a moment ago, and now her fighting spirit has returned," Annie nodded. "You gave her a sense of security and support,which is exactly what she needed."

"That's the advantage of youth-emotions come quickly and go just as fast,
" I commented, patting the back of Annie's hand. "We should also enjoy our meal while it's still warm."
 h

"You're right," Annie picked up her cutlery and began tasting the food before her, making a soft sound of appreciation. "Thisis really excellent,completely to my taste."

Watching Annie enjoy her meal. I felt a warmth spreading in my heart.This kind of ordinary happiness was something I had never noticed in my previous life.
 
###Chapter 119: A Glimpse of the Future

Annie's POV

Howard's hand fell naturally to my waist as we left the restaurant, his touch both gentle and assertive.


"Let's take a walk," he suggested, his deep voice carrying a slight rasp that never failed to captivate me. "Our afternoon schedule is still flexible. We've been so busy lately, there's rarely a chance to just walk together like this."

I nodded, feeling my heartbeat quicken at the simple intimacy of his touch."That sounds perfect."

We stepped out of the restaurant into the sunlight. The city hummed around us, but Howard guided us toward a quieter side street lined with carefully pruned trees. Their branches cast dappled shadows across the sidewalk, creating pools of light and shade that.shifted with the gentle breeze.


Howard reached for my hand, lacing his fingers through mine. His thumb traced absent circles on my skin as we walked in comfortable silence.I stole a glance at his profile-the sunlight softened his usually sharp features, gilding his jawline and catching in his dark hair. The effect was mesmerizing, and I found myself studying the planes of his face longer than I'd intended.

"What are you thinking about?" he asked, catching me staring.

"Nothing important," I replied, feeling heat rise to my cheeks."Just enjoying the moment."

He smiled, the rare expression transforming his face completely. "Have you
 

ever thought about retirement?" he asked suddenly.

The question caught me off guard. "Retirement? Not really," I admitted. "I just know that as long as my hands work. I'll keep drawing. For me, art isn't just a job-it's essential to who I am."


Howard's fingers tightened slightly around mine, his eyes reflecting admiration. "Your passion for creation always amazes me."

"What about you?" I asked, genuinely curious. "Have you thought about what you ll do when you're not running a company anymore?"

Howard stopped walking and turned to face me fully. His gaze was intense,almost burning with an emotion I couldn't quite name.

"I want to build a small vegetable garden next to our house in Long Island," he said, his voice low and intimate. "I'd grow vegetables,maybe keep some fish..."

My heart skipped a beat at the words "our house." The casual way he included me in his future plans sent a warm flutter through my chest.

"Each morning," he continued, stepping closer, "you could draw inside while I work in the garden. We'd have lunch together,sharing the fresh harvest." His eyes locked with mine. "What do you think of a life like that?


I could smell his cologne-subtle notes of sandalwood mixed with something uniquely him. The scent was intoxicating, especially as the distance between us diminished.

"It sounds wonderful," I replied honestly, my voice softer than I'd intended. The mental image he'd painted was serene and perfect.
 

Howard's armslid naturally around my shoulders as we resumed walking,our bodies now close enough that I could feel the solid warmth of him against my side.


"By the time we retire," he said thoughtfully, "Lucy will be nearly thirty."

"That's true," I replied, calculating the years.in my head. "Hard to imagine her as an adult."

Howard's expression grew serious, his brow furrowing slightly,which I found strangely appealing.

"I worry about her future relationships," he confessed. "With her background and the Thompson name, she'll attract people interested only in her wealth and status." His jaw tightened. "I wantto protect her from that kind of pain."

I studied his profile, touched by his concern. This powerful CEO, feared in boardrooms across New York, was worried about his niece's future heartbreaks. The contrast was endearing.

"What do you think?" he asked, turning to me. His fingertips brushed my cheek lightly, and I found myself leaning into his touch.

"I think..." I paused, organizing my thoughts. "I believe in guiding children while respecting their choices. I've been through a bad marriage and the wrong partner-I know the damage that causes." I met his eyes directly, finding understanding there. "But those experiences shaped who I am now."


Howard's thumb gently caressed the corner of my mouth,the intimate gesture momentarily derailing my train of thought.
"I think the best approach is to ensure Lucy's safety while allowing her
 

freedom to make her own decisions," I continued, finding my voice again. "Life is too short to live according to someone else's expectations."

"You don't regret your past choices?" His voice dropped lower, almost a whisper. I could feel his breath brush my ear.

"No. I don't regret them," I replied with quiet certainty. "They taught me how to live for myself."

Something shifted in Howard's gaze, his eyes becoming deeper,more intense. He stopped walking again and turned to face me, his hand cupping my cheek with surprising tenderness.

"Annie," he said, his voice carrying an unusual note of vulnerability,"would you walk toward the future with me?"

I didn't need to think about my answer.

"Of course," I replied without hesitation. "Why wouldn't I? Behind your cool exterior, you have such a gentle heart. You pretend not to care about Catherine, but you've helped her father multiple times. And with Lucy-she's your niece, not your daughter, yet you gave up your carefree life to shoulder a responsibility that wasn't even yours. When Sue was in trouble.you stepped up like a real gentleman..."

I suddenly realized I was rambling, listing his virtues while he watched me with growing amusement and pleasure in his eyes. Heat bloomed in my cheeks.

"I... I just mean..." I faltered.

"I knew you were paying attention," Howard murmured, his lips curving into a satisfied smile.

His arm slipped around my waist, drawing me against him until there was no space left between us. I tilted my head back to look up at him, and he leaned down to capture my lips with his. This kiss was dlifferent from his usual careful approach-it was demanding, passionate, brooking no resistance.


His hand pressed firmly against my back, holding me cose.I could feel his heartbeat accelerating to match my own. My arms wound around his neck naturally, my fingers threading through the short hair at the nape of his neck.


Howard made a low sound of approval as his lips moved from my mouth to my neck, sending a cascade of sensations through my body. I shivered despite the warmth of the afternoon.

"If we weren't on the street..." he whispered against my ear, his voice rough with desire.

My breathing quickened, and I flattened my palm against his chest, feeling the solid muscle there and the rapid beating of his heart.

Just as the moment between us grew increasingly heated,Howard's phone rang sharply. He pulled back with obvious frustration, his brow creased with annoyance. Still, he checked the screen and his expression immediately shifted to one of serious concentration.

"I need to take this," he said, his voice regaining its professional edge.

I nodded, trying to steady my breathing."Iunderstand. I'll head back to the office first."

He nodded, but as I turned to leave,his hand caught my wrist. He leaned close, his lips brushing my ear as he whispered, "We'll continue this
 

tonight."

His promise sent another wave of heat through me. I walked quickly back toward the building, acutely aware of his gaze following me until I turned the corner.

My mind was already racing ahead to the evening, wondering what awaited me.

I touched my lips lightly, still feeling the pressure of his kiss. Our conversation about the future-his vision that so naturally included me-filled me with a warm certainty. And I found myself looking forward to what lay ahead without reservation or fear like a teenage girl.
 
###Chapter 120:I Hope This Life Can Last For ever

Howard's POV

I watched Annie's figure as she walked back toward the office building,her silhouette graceful against the afternoon sunlight. When she disappeared around the corner, I finally answered my ringing phone.

"Hello?" I said, keeping my voice professional despite the lingering effects of our moment together.

"Mr. Thompson," came Mr. Morgan's serious voice on the other end. "Mr.White has suddenly contacted me, saying he no longer wants me involved in this project."

I wasn't surprised. After Bill's humiliating rejection by Catherine,it was predictable that he would seek revenge through his father's business connections. Mr. White was clearly trying to pressure Morgan.

"You haven't told him yet?" I asked calmly, already knowing the answer.

"If he cancels the cooperation, the penalty fee is ten times the original amount," Morgan replied.

I smiled slightly, pleased with my foresight. "If he's willing to pay that money, then take it." I had deliberately set the penalty clause high precisely for situations like this.

Morgan's voice became strained. "That's exactly what I told him, but they're talking about withdrawing investment. They claim if the project can't be completed on time, I'll lose even more."
Cnapler 20ope Ts Life Can Last Forever
"But the key is, we can complete it." I responded confidently,leaning against a nearby tree.

Morgan's voice noticeably relaxed. "So..."

"Are you planning to invest now?" I realized I had circled around to this point and found it somewhat amusing.

Instead of answering directly, I asked, "How is the progress with the procedures I instructed you to follow?"

Before taking on this project, I needed to ensure the White family had clearly stated they wouldn't interfere, and that there were records to prove it. I never fought battles I wasn't certain of winning.

"All completed!" Morgan answered enthusiastically. "I've obtained all the necessary records, and I have lawyers as witnesses."

I nodded in satisfaction, though he couldn't see it. "Good. You can use this opportunity to clear out disloyal employees from your company."

Morgan sounded surprised. "Is that possile?"

"Of course," I responded calmly, watching a bird land on a branch above me.

"Then I'll handle these matters and contact you afterward."

"All right."

I ended the call and took a moment to enjoy the gentle breeze before heading back to the office. The fresh air cleared my head,helping me transition from our intimate moment back to business matters. Still,thoughts of Annie lingered in my mind, and I found myself walking faster

than usual to return to her.

When I entered our office, Annie was already at her workspace, absorbed in a new illustration. The concentration on her face was captivating-her brow slightly furrowed, bottom lip caught between her teeth. She didn't notice me at first, giving me a moment to appreciate her presence.

I walked to the water dispenser, filled two glasses, and brought one to her."Just as I predicted, the White family's behavior is completely within my expectations."


Annie looked up, accepting the water with a grateful smile. "Thank you."She took a sip before asking, "He previously liked Catherine and tried to pressure her family to force marriage. Now that he's interested in someone else, why is he still causing trouble?"

I sat in the chair beside her, close enough that our knees almost touched."Perhaps because he can't accept not getting what he wants." I observed her thoughtful expression. "People like him are accustomed to their families fulfiling their every request, eventually developing a mindset that they must obtain what they like at any cost."

Annie tilted her head, a habit I found endearing. "Couldn't they apply that determination to their work instead?"

"Work requires genuine ability," I explained, watching her eyes follow my reasoning. "The market won't show favoritism because of their identity.When they discover their inadequacy, they retreat to their comfort zone."

"Failure is the mother of success," Annie countered, her eyes bright with conviction.′′Ifyou identify problems and correct them, you'll eventually succeed,won't you?"
-all Last Forever

"Not everyone is willing to learn from mistakes," I said, meeting her gaze directly.

"True enough," Annie shrugged,her shoulder brushing against mine."Rather than these complex schemes, I believe more in hard work,earning money through my own abilities..."

A knock at the door interrupted my thoughts.

"Come in,"I called.

Susan entered, carrying several sample books. "The foreign publishers have finalized all details and would like us to review these. Also, the first batch of merchandise has been shipped, and production capacity now matches sales. Thanks to Sarah's unintentional 'help,' Annie's comics have surged in popularity, with a dramatic increase in followers."

"Do we need to handle such minor matters?" I glanced at the sample books skeptically.

Susan smiled. "These have already been reviewed. I wanted to report the data situation to you, and the results are quite astonishing."

Annie opened her phone to check, her expression instantly transforming into shock. "Oh my God..."

"What is it?" I asked, leaning closer.

"The number of followers has increased more than tenfold since I last checked," Annie said incredulously, her eyes wide. "This really happened
in just a few days?"

Susan nodded in confirmation.′′YeS.′′
  Forever

Annie handed me her phone. Looking at the data, I had to admit it exceeded my expectations. When I initially decided to enter the comic industry, it was merely an experiment. I hadn't anticipated such impressive influence and profitability.

"Both merchandise sales and online views have increased substantially," I told Annie, handing back her phone. "Your income will be several times higher than expected."

This news clearly stunned Annie. She stared at her phone, blinking rapidly as if to confirm the numbers were real.

Susan added,"If we compare with international markets, the potential is even greater. If the project reaches a global level, the returns will be quite significant."

After presenting the results, Susan left us alone.

I gently tapped Annie's shoulder. "Back to reality?"

"I never imagined I could earn this much," Annie admitted, her voice soft with wonder. "It's incredible."

"The market is much larger than we imagined," I said, watching her expression shift between disbelief and joy. "And this is just the beginning.As publicity increases and global audiences become familiar with your work, the income will only continue to grow."

"That's wonderful. This way, I'll soon have enough funds for my mother and me to retire comfortably."

Annie stared at the data, her face radiant with the joy of success.She unconsciously licked her lips, her eyes sparkling with excitement. Her delight was infectious, and I found myself smiling in response.
  Forever

My gaze was involuntarily drawn to her-the slight upward tilt ofher chin,the elegant curve of her neck, and the subtle outline of her collarbone visible beneath herblouse. Seeing her transformation from a dejected divorcée to this confident, independent woman sent a rush of heat through my body.

I moved behind her, placing my hands on her shoulders, feeling the warmth of her skin through the thin fabric. I leaned down, my lips almost touching her earlobe. "You're particularly sexy today..."

My palms slid down her shoulders, my fingertips lightly touching the first button of her blouse. Annie's body noticeably stiffened for an instant before relaxing again. She tilted her head back, her hair brushing against my cheek,carrying a subtle fragrance that was uniquely hers.

She placed her hand over mine, not to stop me but to guide my fingers as I unfastened that first button. My heartbeat accelerated, and just as I was preparing to go further, she suddenly stood up, skillfully slipping out of my embrace.

"Not now, Howard," Annie turned to face me, her eyes flickering with a mixture of desire and rationality. Her finger lightly traced my chest, yet she maintained an arm's length distance. "We still have work to finish,and Lucy will be out of school soon. We need to arrive at the school on time."

As she spoke, she rebuttoned what had just been unfastened,but deliberately moved slowly, ensuring I could see each subtle movement."We'll celebrate properly tonight at home, all right?" she said softly,her tone full of suggestion.
I took a deep breath, forcing myself to calm down. "You're right." I retreated to my own seat, but my gaze remained fixed on her. The way her
  Forever

fitted dress outlined her curves made it impossible to focus on the work in front of me.


Looking at Annie's profile as sheworked diligently,occasionally casting teasing glances my way. I found myself thinking: I hope this life can last forever.
 

###Chapter 121: The Person I Love Has Already Appeared

Philip's POV

I stood on the sidewalk in front of the Howard Technologies building,my fingers repeatedly tapping against the pocket of my suit jacket. The chilly wind blew past, yet it couldn't dispel the restlessness burning inside me.Each time someone emerged from the revolving doors, I unconsciously straightened my back, my gaze eagerly searching for that familiar figure.

Here I was,looking for Annie again. I knew it wasn't right, that I resembled a pathetic stalker. But I simply couldn't stop myself. I needed to see her, needed to talk to her. A day without seeing her felt like I'd lost the ability to breathe.

What had happened to me? I never imagined I would become like this. A grown man, standing outside my ex-wife's workplace like some high school kid with a crush. But I couldn't control myself. I had to see her.

It had been nearly two hours, and Annie still hadn't appeared. I checked my watch; it was just past three o'clock. She wouldn't be off work soon,but maybe she would come down to buy a beverage or something. I tried to calm my nerves, rehearsing in my mind what I would say when I finally saw her.

"Annie, we need to talk..."

"Annie, I was wrong, please give me another chance..."

"Annie, for Brian's sake, we should..."

No matter which opening line I chose, they all seemed weak and hollow.
 

The conversation with Ruth still cut like a sharp blade, the pain vividly stinging my nerves.

And most importantly, Ruth wouldn't help me at all!

I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms, the pain bringing me momentary clarity. Ruth was right-I had hurt Annie,but only now did I understand how serious my mistakes had been.

Not far away, two security guards were eyeing me suspiciously. I straightened my tie, trying hard to look like a client here on business rather than a pathetic man obsessed with his ex-wife. I had to see Annie,had to win her back before she completely fell into Howard's arms. The mere thought of Annie and Howard together sent a twisting pain through my stomach.

A security guard approached me. "Sir, can I help you with something?"

"I'm waiting for someone," I replied dryly.

"I'm sorry, but company policy prohibits non-employees from loitering here. If you have an appointment..."

"Philip?"

Hearing that voice, my heart nearly stopped. I spun around quickly, and there stood Annie, holding a stack of papers, her brow slightly furrowed.She wore a simple navy blue dress, a style I'd never seen before, making her look both professional and elegant. This wasn't the Annie I knew;this Annie looked... more independent,more confident.

"What are you doing here?" Her voice was calmn and cold, as if we were mere acquaintances.
 

"Annie, I..." All the lines I had rehearsed countless times vanished.I stepped forward. "Can we talk?”

Her gaze grew wary, and she took a small step backward. A flash of fatigue crossed her eyes before she sighed. "Again? Philip. What exactly do you want?"


"Please, just a few minutes." I heard a tremor in my own voice.

Annie checked her watch and nodded impatiently. "Five minutes, and then you must leave. I'm tired of this harassment."

The security guard retreated doubtfully but remained watching us from a distance.

"I want tó get back together." The words rushed out, much more direct than I had planned.

Annie froze momentarily, then laughed-a laugh devoid of any warmth."Get back together? We're already divorced,Philip."

"I know, but we can start over." I said urgently. "I can break up with Sarah,I can-"

"You can abandon another woman?" Annie interrupted me. "Just like you abandoned me?"

Her words doused the fire of my hope like ice water. "No, this is different.I... I've come to my senses. Annie, we had six years of marriage, we have a son together. How can we just end it like this?"
"Those are all in the past, Philip." Annie's tone was frighteningly calm."You have Sarah now, and I have Howard. Our lives have already begun moving forward."
 

Hearing Howard'sname, a wave of unnamed anger surged within me. "I can even overlook your relationship with Howard," I blurted out,immediately regretting my choice of words.

Annie's expression turned icy. "Overlook? What right do you have to overlook anything? My life is none of your business, Philip."

She turned to leave, and without thinking, I rushed forward and pulled her into my arms. "Don't go!"

Familiar sensations instantly overwhelmed me. Annie's body contours,the feel of her hair, her body temperature-everything was so familiar,momentarily transporting me back to the past.

I greedily breathed in, wanting to revisit her remembered scent,but detected an unfamiliar note instead. It wasn't any perfume I had given her,but a cooler, masculine essence. Howard's scent. This foreign fragrance stung my nostrils, reminding me that Annie no longer belonged to me.

Her body stiffened instantly in my embrace, like ice. Then she pushed me away forcefully, causing me to stumble back two steps. Her face turned pale. then quickly flushed red, as if humiliated, she rapidly wiped her arms with her hands, as if trying to erase my touch.
"Don't touch me!" Annie's voice wasn't loud, but each word felt like an ice pick. Her eyes flashed with anger, her chest rising and falling rapidly. "You have no right to touch me, understand?"

I stood frozen, shocked by her intense reaction. This wasn't the Annie I knew; she had never rejected my touch before, even after our worst arguments. This profound disgust was new, leaving me feeling suffocated.

Annie stepped back to create a safe distance, straightening the collar I had
  disturbed.


"Were six years of marriage really so easy for you to let go?" My voice carried a hint of pleading.

"Yes." One simple word that collapsed my world.

I released her wrist, feeling a wave of dizziness. "At least for Brian's sake..."

"Brian?" Annie's voice suddenly rose. "That same Brian who's been neglected by your mother, who you barely acknowledge? You remember him now?"

Her words struck a nerve. I had been neglecting him lately. I was too busy with work and Sarah's issues. I thought Brian would adjust...

"I can change," I heard myself say. "Annie, I really can change.Please give me a chance."

She shook her head, hereyes revealing an emotion close to pity. "You always say that, Philip. Every time you come looking for me, it's the same words. But the truth is, you haven't changed; you're just realizing Sarah isn't as wonderful as you imagined, so you're back seeking me out."

"It's not like that!"I protested. "I'm sincere."

"Let me go, Philip." Her voice was calm but resolute.

"I love you, Annie. I've always loved you." I knew I sounded pathetic, but at that moment, I didn't care.

Annie forcefully pushed me away, stepping back, her eyes flashing with anger. "If you loved me, you wouldn't have abandoned me immediately after your first date with Sarah. If you loved me, you wouldn't have taken
 

my son away from me. If you loved me, you wouldn't have realized your so-called love only after our divorce."

Each of her words hit mewith precision. I felt my eyes burning but fought hard to hold back tears.

"What about Howard?" I asked, almost through gritted teeth. "How do you know he won't be just like me? It's in aman's nature to seek new targets after getting what he wants."

Annie's expression softened slightly, it seemed. "The difference between you and Howard is that you never knew what you truly wanted. Before you had Sarah, you thought she was the best; after losing me, you suddenly thought I was irreplaceable. You always want what you can't have.Philip."

"And Howard..."

"Howard knows what he wants." A deep male voice came from behind me.

I turned to see Howard Thompson standing there, his tall figure casting a shadow. He showed no hostility, simply walking calmly to Annie's side and gently placing his hand on her shoulder.

What pained me was that Annie not only didn't avoid his touch as she had mine, but actually leaned slightly toward him, that naturally expressed intimacy cutting me like a knife.

"The person I love has already appeared," Howard said, looking at Annie,then turned to me, "and that won't change."
###Chapter 122: Just Wait,Annie

Philip's POV

I stood there, watching Howard take Annie's hand, having just arrogantly declared, "The person I love has already appeared, and that won't change."

A twisting pain shot through my chest. I couldn't bear to see Annie leaning toward him-she who had once been my wife, now looking at him with a love I'd never seen before. All because of Howard. If not for him,Annie would surely have come back to me.

I needed to defend myself, my gaze fixed directly on Howard's detestable face. "Before Sarah appeared, I was good to Annie too..."

"When Sarah appeared, you changed your mind, proving you never truly loved Annie," Howard calmly interrupted, his logical analysis infuriating me."While I, on the other hand, genuinely appreciate her.I see all her virtues, which is why I gradually fell in love with her."

He thought he understood Annie? Six years of marriage, and he thought he could surpass that in just a few months? I felt a wave of anger rising within me.

"I've also thought about the potential problems we might face..."I attempted to argue.

Howard cut me off again: "And I've mentally prepared myself to face these issues. No matter how difficult things become,we'll face them together."

The way he said it, as if he understood loving someone better than I did.It was utterly humiliatng. Inside me churned an indescribable fury; I couldn't believe someone would love Annie so deeply. As her former

husband. I couldn't comprehend why someone like Howard would choose her.


"With your status and position, you could have any woman. Why specifically Annie?" I practically shouted. "She's been mnarried before, has a child... you hadn't even dated anyone before. She's not good enough for you!"


My words grew increasingly hurtful, but I couldn't control myself. Annie merely gave a cold laugh. which angered me further. Wouldn't she even defend herself anymore?

Howard's gaze sharpened, his voice carrying a hint of frost: "The fact that you think this way proves you never appreciated Annie. To me, Annie is gentle in nature but extraordinarily strong within. She also possesses remarkable foresight."

He continued, his tone cutting: "When she was with you, you made her a housewife,burying all her talents. You made her seem no different from others, then complained she wasn't as exceptional as other women."
"But wasn't that your fault? If you had been willing to hire maids and cooks,giving her time to pursue her interests, you would have seen how she shines in industries she's passionate about, admired by many."
I felt blood rushing through my veins. How dare he judge our marriage like this? How dare he pretend he knew Annie better than I did?

"In fact, by belittling her this way, deep down you know Annie is truly exceptional," Howard deliberately slowed his pace, speaking as if lecturing a child who didn't know better.
"That's impossible!" I protested instinctively, but deep inside, a small voice

told mne he might be right, which only fueled my anger.

"It you truly thought she wasn't good, you wouldn't regret losing,her,would you?" Howard's tone carried that detestable confidence.

I remained silent, turning my gaze toward Annie, but she only stared at Howard as if I didn't exist at all. Seeing her expression, my heart ached even more. What I once possessed now completely belonged to another man.


"Eventually, you'll meet someone better than Annie..." I tried to say something to undermine their relationship, to make Howard doubt his feelings for Annie.

Howard interrupted without hesitation: "There will never be anyone better than Annie."

I saw Annie's expression change, and she looked at me with unprecedented contempt: "So, Philip, do you finally understand how vast the gap is between you and Howard?"

Her words left me speechless. I couldn't answer, could only stand there feeling the agony of each passing second.

"Don't harbor unrealistic fantasies about me. From every angle, Howard is better than you. I don't understand why I should give him up to choose someone inferior to him in every way." Annie's voice was calm yet firm.

I felt a glimmer of hope fading. Had Annie truly given up on me completely? I had to make one final attempt: "Yes, he's good. I won't deny that. But wasn't I good to you too when we first got together? Can you guarantee Howard won't become like me in the future?"

Annie didn't immediately answer, giving me a ray of hope.
 

"Annie, if Howard ever disappoints you, you can come back to me." I said sincerely,hoping to plant a seed of doubt in her mind.

"That won't happen," Annie responded firmly, crushing my last hope."I trust he won't change,but even if he does eventually treat me poorly, I would only leave him. But I would never consider reconciling with you."

"Because..." She looked directly into my eyes, her voice clear and resolute,"No matter how difficult life might be alone, it would still be better than those six years with you. Since the day I divorced you, I've never thought about going back."

Her words completely destroyed my last hope. I felt tears flowing uncontrollably, which was humiliating-showing such vulnerability in front of the person I despised most.

"Fine, I'll remember that," I managed to keep my voice steady, then turned and quickly walked back to my car.

Sitting in my car, I gripped the steering wheel tightly, my gaze still fixed in their direction. I felt filled with hatred, especially loathing toward Howard.If not for him, Annie wouldn't treat me this way. It was he who had transformed her into a different person, he who had taken what should have been mine.

I couldn't understand why Annie wouldn't forgive me. I had only made one small mistake-doesn't everyone deserve a second chance to make amends?

Howard's superior attitude made me sick. Who did he think he was to judge my marriage like that? Just because he had money and power, he thought he could simply take someone else's wife?
 

I wiped away my tears, feeling utterly rejected and heartbroken.Just then,my phone rang.

"Hello?" I answered, trying to make my voice sound normal.

"Remember when you asked me to investigate Howard? I've found something." The voice on the other end immediately revived my spirits.

"What did you find?" I askedeagerly.

"I discovered that during Howard's high school years..." he said with satisfaction. "he had a profound first love, an unrequited first love."

"Really?" I could hardly believe it, my heart racing.

"You don't believe me?" he laughed.

"So Howard is just like me!" I suddenly felt a wave of joy. Before, I had been haunted by the "perfect Howard" that Annie had portrayed, but now knowing he had weaknesses just like me made me feel immensely relieved.

"Keep investigating," I instructed, my mood beginning to improve.

After hanging up, my thoughts became active. If Howard had a an unrequited first love, then her reappearance might divert Howard's attention from Annie-just as Sarah had once diverted mine.

When that happened, Howard would neglect Annie just as I had, and I would have my chance to win her back.

I told myself to be patient, not to rush. Most importantly, Annie would eventually return to me. Howard wasn't as perfect as he appeared; he simply hadn't faced enough temptation and tests yet.
I decided not to tell Annie about this discovery yet. I would first gather
 

more evidence, so when I revealed it to Annie, she would immediately lose trust in Howard. I wanted her to see Howard's true face, to see that he didn't love her as much as he claimed.

A thought surfaced in my mind: if I couldn't have Annie, then neither should Howard.

As I started the car, a kind of dark satisfaction settled over me. I had been too rash today, too emotional. I needed a different approach. I needed to be smart,strategic-patient. Yes, patience would be key.

"Just wait, Annie," I whispered to myself. "You'll see him for who he really is."
 
###Chapter 123: The Price of Arrogance

Howard's POV

Having just escorted Philip from the premises, I returned to my office with a measured stride, my mind already calculating the next necessary steps.Annie had composed herself admirably after Philip's unwelcome appearance,but I could still detect the lingering strain behind her eyes. It reinforced my resolve to address not just one, but both of today's disruptions.

I settled into my chair, reaching for my phone with deliberate calm. The sequence of numbers for Bill White's father came automatically as I dialed,my expression neutral but my intent anything but.

When Mr. White answered, his voice carried that practiced cordiality of old money-smooth and devoid of genuine warmth. "Mr. Thompson,to what do I owe this pleasure?"

"It appears your company doesn't consider Howard Technologies worthy of respect," I stated, my tone deliberately cool, stripped of any pretense of politeness. "Your people now feel emboldened enough to come to my company and harass my valuable employees."

From the corner of my eye, I saw Annie gathering her sketches, moving toward my desk with a slight weariness still evident in her posture.The sight of her attempting to maintain her composure after Philip's intrusion only strengthened my determination to resolve the issue with the White family once and for all.

"That can't be right," Mr. White quickly responded,his voice dripping with hollow flattery. "I have nothing but the utmost respect for you, Mr.Thompson." His casual tone betrayed his lack of sincerity.
 

"Whenever I interact with any Howard Technologies employee," he continued. "I practically treat them like royalty. I'm even afraid to speak too loudly around them." He concluded with an empty assurance:"This must certainly be a misunderstanding!"

I narrowed my eyes, recognizing that despite his many words, Mr. White had offered no actual solution. He was stalling, and I had no patience for such tactics. "Is that so?" I replied with characteristic directness.

"So you're saying that your son actively bullied my employee," I continued,my voice steady but pointed, "and you believe this issue can be resolved through simple denial of intent?"

I made it clear that such a superficial approach wouldn't suffice: "If my company's employees were to forgive you so easily, perhaps employees at other companies might follow suit in the future?"

The sharp question left Mr. White momentarily speechess. I could almost visualize his practiced smile freezing on his face. "How would you like me to resolve this matter?" he eventually asked.

I could sense the unspoken tension-Mr. White would unconditionally side with his son rather than with an "insignificant employee" from another company. It reminded me of Philip's disrespectful behavior toward Annie this afternoon, and of all the times Betty had made Annie's life difficult. These self-proclaimed elites seemed to have forgotten the most basic principle of respect.

I let out a cold laugh, noting the irony-though Bill's family was clearly in the wrong, Mr. White was behaving as if I were the offending party. My patience had reached its limit.
I never wasted time on such matters, and responded with finality: "I'd
 

prefer you handle nothing at all." Without waiting for a response, I ended the call.

Annie stood by my desk, having obviously overheard my conversation and sensed my negative energy. She set down her sketches and asked with genuine concern, "What's wrong?"

Seeing Annie, my expression immediately softened. Despite enduring Philip's harassment, she still cared about my emotional state, which sent a wave of warmth through me. "Bill's father," I explained. "His son comes to my company to harass employees, but he doesn't seem to think it's a serious issue."

"Perhaps having a social status far above the average person has created an illusion of superiority," I continued thoughtfully, unconsciously connecting today's two incidents. "But in today's society, aren't all people equal? Whether they're from the White family or the Baker family."

I looked directly into Annie's eyes, seeking her perspective and also wanting to confirm she had fully recovered from her encounter with Philip.

Annie nodded without hesitation: "Absolutely. They're just like Philip,always thinking they're above everyone else."

I felt a surge of satisfaction, appreciating her clear insight. I gently patted her arm,saying with quiet confidence, "It's fine. The principles they don't,understand-I'll teach them. Just like I did with Philip today."

Annie looked at me with concern: "What are you planning to do?"

I was already contacting Susan: "Some of our contracts with the White family are expiring soon, correct?"

Susan confirmed: "Yes, but because their products are so outdated, they're
 

currently unpopular in the market..."

She continued, "We were planning not to renew with them, but couldn't find a suitable reason."


"Now we have a reason," I said calmly. "You recently mentioned that other companies' products are noticeably better than theirs, right?"

Susan confirmed: "Yes."

"Then find the most suitable company among them for cooperation,"I instructed decisively. "We simply need to change partners."

Susan expressed concern: "Suddenly changing partners after years of cooperation will certainly cause resentment."

I slowed my speech, radiating confidence: "Leave it to me. I'll handle it.
Consider it the second task after dealing with Philip today."

This reassured Susan: "Very well, sir."

I continued my strategic breakdown: "We're optimistic about several other projects and plan to collaborate with them, correct?"

After a moment's consideration, Susan reported these projects to me.

"Cancel all of these projects," I commanded coolly. "Find other partners."

Susan wanted to ask if such extreme measures were necessary,but remembering that my decisions, even when initially questioned,typically proved wise in the long run, she decided to trust my judgment:"Understood,sir."
After ending the call, I took Annie's hand and led her to the private lounge area.
 

Having heard my conversation, Annie expressed surprise: "You're canceling all cooperation with them? Just as decisively as when you told Philip never to come back?"

"Yes." I confirmed without hesitation. My hand gently stroked the back of hers as I explained my reasoning: "His son's lawless behavior is already beyond help, just like Philip's, and doesn't deserve a second chance."

"If he truly intends to pass his company to his son, their company will be bankrupt within a few years," I analyzed. "I called him earlier to confirm his attitude."

"If his mind were still functioning properly, he could have better disciplined his son. I could have pointed out the problem for him to fix,and we could have continued cooperating."

"But clearly his thinking aligns with his son's..." My voice carried a hint of contempt. "He believes only he himself matters, while others are insignificant...exactly how Philip treated you."

I methodically explained my reasoning: "Continuing to cooperate with such people would ultimately drag us down."

"So my thinking is, it's better to sever ties early," I concluded. "This gives the company sufficient time to find new partners."

Annie looked at me with admiration: "You really consider everything so thoroughly. Unlike Philip, who only sees immediate benefits."

"This is an essential ability for someone at the highest level of a company,"I replied, accustomed to this mode of thinking. "Otherwise, if we only focused on immediate situations..."

"The company would eventually go bankrupt. Then what would happen
 

to the employees?" I felt the weight of responsibility on my shoulders."I must consider their wellbeing,just as I must protect you and Lucy."

Annie leaned into my embrace: "Indeed. That's the biggest difference between you and Philip."

Just then, my phone rang again. I answered casually: "Hello?"

It was Catherine's father, Mr. Morgan. "I was just about to bring the evidence to you when Mr. White suddenly called, saying that if I'm willing to tell you that Bill has already apologized to Catherine..."
 
###Chapter 124: The Price of Arrogance Part II

Howard's POV

"I was just about to bring the evidence to you when Mr. White suddenly called, saying that if I'm willing to tell you that Bill has already apologized to Catherine..." Morgan paused on the other end of the line, his voice carrying a note of disbelief. "...and that my daughter has explicitly stated she's willing to forgive Bill, he would agree to continue investing in my company."

I couldn't help but let out a cold laugh. From the beginning, this entire situation had carried an absurd quality that defied common sense.

"Mr. Morgan," I replied, my tone measured yet firm, "let me confirm the facts with you." I proceeded to detail exactly how Bill and his girlfriend Grace had confronted Catherine in our company restaurant, ensuring I didn't omit a single relevant detail.

The line went silent for a moment. When Morgan finally spoke again,his voice was tightly controlled, barely containing hisindignation. "If I hadn't called you about this and blindly agreed to his demands, wouldn't that make me an incompetent father who sells out his daughter for business interests? That's absolutely unacceptable!"

I could hear the shock and outrage in his voice. Years of experience in the business world had taught me that people might compromise under commercial pressure, especially when their company faces financial difficulties. I needed to ensure Morgan wouldn't waver under the White family's threats.

"Even if he agrees now, he'll continue to make things difficult for you in the future," I stated coolly. "So it's best to refuse him outright."
 

"Don't worry!" Morgan promised without hesitation, his voice suddenly filled with resolve. "I absolutely will not allow my daughter to be humiliated like this! Mr. Thompson, please wait a moment. I'll contact you after I've dealt with this matter."

"Come directly to my office after you've handled it," I immediately responded. "We'll assess the next steps together."

"No problem," he said before hanging up.

I set down the phone and drummed my fingers lightly against the desktop.I was curious to see how Morgan would handle this situatíon. As a business partner, he displayed remarkable principles-something increasingly rare in today's business world. But I also knew that principles were often the most expensive luxury one could afford.

I walked to the window, gazing down at the bustling Manhattan cityscape below. In this concrete jungle, countless deals were made every day,and most people would choose profit over principle.How long could Morgan hold out? I wasn't certain, but I had already formulated strategies for every possibility.

I took out my phone and sent a brief instruction to Susan: "Pauseall collaborative projects with White's company. Details to follow."

Without waiting for a response, I slipped my phone back into my pocket. I knew Susan would handle this matter appropriately; she always executed my instructions perfectly, which was why I valued her.

I returned to my desk and began addressing other pending matters.While waiting for MMorgan's response, I decided not to waste a single minute.
Approximately forty minutes later, my private phone rang. I glanced at the

caller ID and felt the corner of my mouth turn up slightly. I leaned back comfortably in my leather chair, staring at the ceiling, and began a silent countdown:

"Three,two,one..."

Just as I finished counting, my business phone rang. Right on schedule, it was Mr. White. I pressed the answer button, deliberately keeping my voice cold.

"Mr. Thompson, is it really necessary to take such extreme measures?"White's voice carried obvious anxiety. I could imagine him pacing back and forth in his Long Island mansion office.

His secretary must have just reported that all ongoing and upcoming collaborative projects with Howard Technologies had been suddenly canceled-even those scheduled for early renewal.

White had finally realized I might be genuinely angry. I could almost hear the complaints in his mind-was I really severing our business relationship over such a "minor issue" between "the kids"?

"When paths diverge, cooperation ends," I responded calmly but firmly."Mr. White, you have your perspective, which I disagree with. Therefore,I believe choosing not to cooperate is best for both of us."

"But don't forget," White's tone carried a hint of veiled threat,"our company brings enormous profits to your tech company every year!Without us, could Howard Technologies have developed so rapidly in Silicon Valley style?"

His tone suggested I owed him an immense debt of gratitude, which almost made me laugh. In that moment, I suddenly realized that White's
 

arrogance toward me wasn't innate-it stemmed from his genuine belief that Howard Technologies benefited more from our partnership, earning higher profits.

This realization struck me as remarkably amusing. In all my years in the business world. I'd never encountered someone with such a profound lack of market insight.

Sensing my silence, White quickly added, "If we stop cooperating,how will you explain to your other shareholders the loss of such significant annual profits?"

"There are many companies in the tech industry, not just yours," I responded coolly. "I can certainly choose to work with others.So there's no need for your concern."

With that, I decisively ended the call, giving him no opportunity to continue his threats.

I rose easily from the sofa and straightened my suit. Without a doubt,White must now be glaring angrily at his phone, perhaps ordering his secretary to find other business partners. His thinking was too simplistic:the more I yielded to him, the more arrogant he believed I became,so he needed to prove that his company could thrive even without Howard Technologies.

Unfortunately, he had misjudged the situation.

As I pondered this, I heard a knock at the door. "Come in," I said.

Morgan entered my office, his expression noticeably more relaxed than during our phone call. He walked to my desk and handed me a folder.
"I called Mr. White directly," he stated, making no effort to hide the pride

in his voice. "I even activatedcall recording."

He briefly described the conversation-how he had directly addressed the White family's absurd behavior, how he had rejected White's threats and investment offers. stating he would rather see his company bankrupt than compromise his daughter's dignity.

"I told him I would rather go bankrupt than let Catherine suffer such unjust treatment!" Morgan's eyes shone with determination. "You know what he said? He said, 'You've got quite the backbone for someone in your position! Then he threatened that without their money, plus our funding gap, no Wall Street firm would help us."

He shook his head with a laugh. "I just said 'That's none of your business'and hung up."

I nodded appreciatively. Morgan had more principle than I'd anticipated.But I also knew the price of principles was often steep.

Taking the folder he handed me, I saw it contained all the evidence he'd collected-including recorded conversations,email correspondence,and even testimonies from several witnesses. Though my Ivy League education had given me some legal understanding, I recognized my limitations compared to professional lawyers.

I picked up the phone and contacted the legal department: "Please send your best people over. It's regarding the White family case."

Approximately three minutes later, a legal expert stood in my office. After understanding our needs, she explained in the simplest, most direct terms how each piece of evidence would function if the White family decided to sue us.
 

"So," I looked into the lawyer's eyes, needing a definitive answer,"all this evidence will be useful?"

###Chapter 125: Always Staying One Step Ahead of Others

Caroline Gluck's POV

I stood outside Howard Thompson's office, mny back pressed against the partially open door as I carefully adjusted my position to ensure I could hear everything while remaining undetected. This "accidental" way of gathering business intelligence had become an essential survival skill in Manhattan. Besides, any opportunity to catch a glimpse of Howard was one I wouldn't pass up.

Through the crack in the door. I could see Howard sitting behind his expansive desk. his perfect silhouette causing me to involuntarily bite my lower lip. Everything about Howard exuded an elegant yet powerful presence-even simply sitting there listening, he radiated a magnetism no one else could match.

By contrast, Mr. Morgan sitting across from him could only be described as "bloated"-a typicaI middle-aged successful man with a beer belly poorly concealed beneath his suit and a receding hairline stubbornly maintaining that ridiculous hairstyle.

"So,all this evidence will be useful?" Howard's voice came through clearly as he discussed the case against the White family with a lawyer. Just the sound of his voice made my heart race a little faster.

"Yes, absolutely. There are no obvious gaps in the documentation," the lawyer responded with professional confidence.

"All their escape routes have been thoroughly blocked," Howard told Mr.
Morgan. Watching Howard's self-assured expression, I couldn't help
ShdpystepAnead of Others
imagining how wonderful it would feel to have him look at me with that same victorious gaze. Of course. I was well aware that men like Howard would always prefer women like Annie. not someone at my level.Sometimes this reality left a bitter taste, but I'd learned to accept it.

Mr. Morgan's face displayed obvious relief. Honestly, though he was at least twenty years my senior and decidedly ordinary in appearance, his bank account and social standing could compensate for these shortcomings.If he were to show interest in me. I might not be entirely opposed.Naturally, the initiative would have to come from him-I certainly wouldn't lower myself to pursue a bloated middle-aged man, regardless of his wealth.


"Should we publicly announce our partnership now?" Mr. Morgan asked eagerly, like a child waiting to unwrap a present. This lack of sophistication was precisely why men like him would never reach HHoward s caliber.

"Yes. let's do that," HIoward agreed.

The lawyer left the office, and Mr. MIorgan immediately began contacting his staff to arrange for a press release about their collaboration with Howard Technologies.

Meanwhile,Howard started instructing his PR department to issue corresponding statements. Watching Howard mobilize an entire company's resources with a single phone cal1. I couldn't help but admire the allure of such power. How magnificent it would be to become the partner of such a man! But why did someone like Annie deserve all this? I was smarter,more cunning, and understood the rules of this world better than she did.

"This project may exceed what your company can currently handle independently," Howard continued telling Mr. Morgan. "What if I assign
-aytepAnead of Others
some of my employees to assist your team?"

"That would be fantastic!" Mr. Morgan's voice overflowed with gratitude.
Looking at him, he resembled a child who'd just received candy.

Hearing this, I quietly took several steps back and quickly headed toward my own office. Howard's generosity left me,lost in thought. He supported Annie's creative work so wholeheartedly-no wonder her mediocre illustrations generated such impressive revenue. Meanwhile, the company expected me to financially support Sarah's project? This inequality infuriated me, but I knew that in this world, complaining changed nothing-only action did.

Sitting at my desk, a sudden idea struck me. Sarah had money, despite constantly extracting funds from Philip, her own savings weren't insignificant. I picked up the phone and dialed Sarah's number.

"Sarah, darling," I began in a sweet tone, "I just discovered some astonishing news about Annie."

I briefly explained how Annie had secured substantial income through Howard Technologies' support, then mentioned my conversation with the company secretary. "Would you be willing to invest in your own work?
With your talent, you could absolutely earn more than Annie."

Sarah remained silent on the other end. I knew she was weighing the pros and cons, like a cunning fox calculating how to obtain the most prey.

"You don't want to invest?" I deliberately added a hint of disappointment to my voice. "Do you really want to watch Annie become famous globally while you remain an obscure illustrator? Do you want to see Annie earning substantial money while you receive only minimal monthly royalties?"
After a moment of continued silence, Sarah finally spoke: "But my relationship with Philip isn't great right now. Caroline,his mind is completely occupied with Annie. There's no space for me in his thoughts anymore."

I laughed contemptuously in my mind. Sarah always connected everything to men, as if she couldn't make decisions without them. This dependency disgusted me, but it was precisely this weakness that made her so easy to manipulate.


"Maybe we should forget about this?" Sarah suggested."My main focus now is extracting as much money as possible from Philip and saving it."

"But you don't know how much Annie is earning..." I lowered my voice,deliberately creating suspense. "The amount is enough to make anyone envious. Her monthly royalty income has already reached jaw-dropping figures, and that's just the beginning. This month's earnings are projected to be even higher, and by next month's payment, the amount will be astronomical."

I knew these figures were somewhat exaggerated, but with people like Sarah, a little embellishment was sometimes necessary.

"How many companies today can generate such lucrative profits?" I continued."Sarah, did you know that Howard Technologies offers the most generous royalty split in the industry? If you miss this opportunity,you'll regret it for the rest of your life."

Sarah was finally convinced. "I'll contact Philip to see if I can persuade him to help me with this investment."
"T'll await your good news," I said with satisfaction as I hung up.
Less than an hour later, Sarah called back, eagerly inquiring about the required initial investment amount. This was proceeding even more smoothly than I'd anticipated.

"Let me ask the company secretary right now," I said, immediately heading toward Susan Moore's office.

Standing outside her office, I knocked gently. "Come in1," she responded coolly.

I entered the office, deliberately keeping my head down in a display of humility. "How much would we need to invest in Sarah's comics for the company to help with merchandise production?" I asked softly.

Susan stared at me for several seconds, and I could almost feel her contemplating something. She surely knew about Howard's warning regarding Sarah, but now that we were asking about specific amounts,she couldn't simply refuse.

She finally said, "If you're willing to cover the costs yourselves, with Howard Technologies handling production and sales of merchandise, then most of the profits would go to us, correct?"

I nodded in agreement, pretending to seriously consider her words.

"So after careful consideration," she continued, "you can maintain your position at Howard Technologies, but Sarah's intellectual property could be transferred to another company. This way, you'll have complete control.can provide better resources for her, and focus more on her work. Most importantly, you'll earn more money yourselves."

This proposal was the perfect solution! I could barely conceal my delight.

"No need to consider further!" I exclaimed excitedly. "When would it be
convenient to terminate Sarah's contract with us?"

"Right now." Susan immediately stood up, evidently eager to resolve this matter.

With her assistance, all termination procedures were completed in less than half an hour. I expressed my gratitude to her, though I didn't truly feel grateful-in Manhattan's business world, no one does anything completely selflessly.

Back in my office, I immediately called Sarah, relaying Susan's suggestion word for word, of course concealing the fact that the contract had already been terminated.

"What do you think?" I asked. "Do you want to continue working with Howard Technologies, or terminate the contract and sign with another company?"

Sarah responded almost without hesitation: "Let's sign with another company. If I stay with Howard Technologies, I'll forever be overshadowed by Annie with Howard supporting her. Caroline, my work quality is better than Annie's, so I should be more famous and earn more money,shouldn'tI?"

"Absolutely!" I 'agreed, secretly rejoicing that everything was proceeding so smoothly.

"Then we'll act separately," Sarah decided. "I'll convince Philip, and you handle the contract termination process."

"No problem!" I responded enthusiastically, unable to suppress a smug smile after hanging up. Sarah would never know that she could no longer return to Howard Technologies, which was exactly what I wanted. This
was the way to survive in New York high society-always staying one step ahead of others.

###Chapter 126: You're Right, Let's Do It Your Way

Sarah's POV

I had just hung up with Caroline, who explicitly suggested I convince Philip to invest in my work. The thought of this plan brought an involuntary smile to my lips. I knew perfectly well this was an excellent opportunity to strike at Annie. Just imagining her face when she saw my work becoming more popular than hers-that self-righteouis expression crumbling-filled me with delicious anticipation.

Philip was like a dog on a leash now. He might not love me anymore, but he remained embarrassngly easy to manipulate. The more desperately he wanted Annie to reconsider, the more eagerly he'd rush to help me. That's the pathetic nature of men.

I dialed Philip's number, arranging my features into a practiced expression of vulnerability even though he couldn't see me. Old habits die hard.

"What is it?" Philip's voice sounded dull and flat. He was clearly in a foul mood.

I immediately switched to my helpless damsel persona-a tactic that had always worked wonders with Philip. He loved playing the savior, and I only needed to be the fragile woman in need of rescue.

"Hmm." I deliberately lowered my voice, affecting an injured tone. "Annie's bullying me again." Inwardly, I smirked. Annie wouldn't even deign to "bully" me-she barely spared me a glance these days.
"What happened?" His tone was impatient, but I could sense his interest piquing.
I rapidly wove a tapestry of lies in my mind. With men like Philip, the more specific the details. the better. They never bother to verify anything.

"Annie came up to me, acting all high and mighty, saying her comics are actually quite ordinary." My voice grew progressively weaker,feigning distress as I twisted the phone cord between my fingers as if genuinely wounded. "Even Caroline said they're terribly unattractive and won't appeal to readers."

I paused deliberately before continuing: "But Howard has the power to make her earn so much money. Unlike me... whose work is of exceptional quality, but because no one promotes me, I can't even afford to produce merchandise."

"How much do you need?" Philip asked directly.

I nearly laughed out loud. This was even easier than I'd anticipated-he'd taken the bait! I bit my lower lip, suppressing my triumphant feelings.I'd expected to invest more effort in persuading him, but he was so desperate to prove himself superior to Howard. A man's pride is such a useful tool.

"I'm not sure of the exact amount," I pretended to hesitate. "I need to ask Caroline."

"Alright, I'll wait for your answer. Contact me after Caroline tells you, and I'll transer the money directly to you."

"Thank you," I said with genuine sincerity, while contemplating how to further exploit this opportunity. "Even though you don't love me anymore,you've done so much for me. I really appreciate it."
"No need for thanks, Sarah. Even though we're no longer married, I still want you to do well."
 

I almost burst out laughing. My charm was clearly irresistible. Look how easily I controlled him-just a few words, a little feigned vulnerability, and he'd obediently hand over money. I gently caressed my phone, already planning my next move. This game was just beginning. Annie and Howard,you just wait and see.

I called Caroline again to check on her progress.

"Sarah, you know what," Caroline said on the other end. "Susan told me that if you're willing to cover the costs yourself, with Howard Technologies handling the production and sales of your merchandise, most of the profits would go to them."

"So," Caroline continued, "after careful consideration, you can continue to work at Howard Technologies, but your intellectual property could be transferred to another company. This way, you'll have complete control,can provide better resources for your work, and focus more on your creations. Most importantly, you'll earn more money yourself!"

"So what do you think-should your work remain with Howard Technologies, or should we terminate the contract and sign with another company?" Caroline asked.

This idea was brilliant! I answered without hesitation: "Let's sign with another company. If I stay with Howard Technologies, I'll definitely be overshadowed by Annie," I clenched my fist, unconsciously gritting my teeth at the thought of Annie's smug expression. The very image made me uncomfortable. "Caroline, my work quality is better than Annie's, so I should be more famous and earn more money, shouldn't I?"

This wasn't merely about money-it was about letting everyone see who the true genius was. Annie was only successful because of Howard's support, while I relied on genuine talent.
 

"Absolutely!" Caroline sounded delighted that I agreed with her suggestion.She, like me, couldn't stand Annie's demeanor.

"Then we'll act separately," I said confidently. "Tll convince Philip, and you handle the contract termination process."

"No problem!" Caroline replied.

I hung up, a satisfied smile playing on my lips. CarolineGluck and I were natural allies; she seemed to enjoy manipulating others as much as I did.For something this important, a face-to-face conversation would be more persuasive. I grabbed my purse and called a driver to take me to Philip Investment Group headquarters.

In the car, I meticulously prepared my expressions and body language.Handling Philip required the perfect blend of vulnerability and shrewdness-too much of either would make him suspicious.

The company employees all recognized me and let me pass without interference. I walked directly to Philip's office, took a deep breath,composed my expression, and after receiving permission to enter, pushed open the door.

I sat across from Philip, resting my chin on my hands,gazing directly at him with eyes deliberately betraying a hint of vulnerability and need for assistance. Philip continued working, not even looking up as he said, "If you have something to say, just say it." Observing his cold attitude,I secretly laughed. He thought himself so aloof, unaware that every step followed my script.

"Don't you think," I probed cautiously, "that investing large sums in Howard, only to receive a small portion in return... seems like a poor deal?"
 

Philip stopped working and looked up at me: "What do you mean?"

I leaned forward, lowering my voice: "I've learned from Caroline that Annie's copyright share is only fifteen percent." I gently bit my lower lip.pretending to be deeply concerned. "How many merchandise items would we need to sell just to break even?"

I could feel his attention completely focused on me now. This sensation of being observed was intoxicating; I knew I'd seized control of the conversation.


Philip stared at me, his eyes flashing with a familiar gleam-he was calculating something. "What are you thinking?" he asked.

Seeing his contemplative expression, I knew the moment had arrived. A thrill of excitement rose up my spine. This was like a meticulously planned hunt, and the prey was stepping into my trap one step at a time.

"I want to sign my work to your company," I softened my voice further,as if sharing an important secret. "That way, when it makes money,the company gets a substantial portion. And what I take home will certainly be significant as well."

Philip didn't immediately respond. Instead, he leaned back in his chair,considering. His expression shifted subtly-I could read that look. He was weighing pros and cons. I knew the current Philip had little feeling left for me; if it were solely for my benefit, he probably wouldn't be willing to invest such significant resources. I inwardly scoffed. Men's pride is so ridiculous-he never truly loved me or Annie, only himself. I needed to provide a more appealing reason, one that would satisfy his vanity.

A thought struck me, and I smiled. "I know your company earns plenty and doesn't care about this small amount, but think about it..." My fingers
 

lightly tapped the desk as I leaned slightly forward, allowing my perfume to waft subtly toward him. "If you use the money earned from my work to reinvest in my creations and promote me, wouldn't my earnings far exceed Annie's?"


I noticed Philip's expression change-it was a look I knew well, a mixture of desire, greed, and competitiveness. He had taken the bait. My inner excitement was almost uncontainable, though outwardly I maintained just the right balance of expectation and dependence.

"Imagine Annie seeing that Howard, with his enormous company, is so stingy with her," I deliberately added a slight tremor to my voice, as if excited by the thought. "While you're willing to let me earn without reservation... wouldn't she think Howard is too selfish, completely inferior to you?"

That was the killing blow. Watching Philip's expression, I knew my words had fully ignited his desire to compete with Howard. Men's vanity and competitiveness were such easily exploitable weaknesses.

He predictably displayed a determined smile: "You're right, let's do it your way."

I laughed inwardly while outwardly showing only a hint of joy,quickly suppressed as I pretended calmly: "Then shall I check on Caroline's progress?"
 
###Chapter 127: I Merely Wanted to Conquer Hi m

Sarah's POV

Caroline drew a deep breath on the other end of the line.

I felt a flicker of unease. "They're not refusing to terminate the contract,are they?" I asked, an odd premonition rising within me. My intuítion warned me things wouldn't go this smoothly.

But Caroline wouldn't lie to me; we'd been friends for years. Besides, she had no reason to deceive me about something like this.

"They were reluctant at first," Caroline replied. Her voice sounded somewhat weary, as if she'd truly expended considerable effort.

"But I stood my ground," she continued. "No matter what they said, I kept repeating that I wanted to terminate the contract. They had no choice but to comply."

I couldn't help smiling, praising her sincerely: "You're amazing, Caroline."

"Of course," Caroline accepted my compliment, confidence evident in her tone. "After all, you're my friend. Isn't it only natural that I'd make some effort for you?"

"Indeed it is." Having gotten the answer I wanted, my mood brightened considerably as I ended the call with Caroline and turned to Philip. "Good news! My comic has successfully terminated its contract with Howard Technologies!"

Philip immediately picked up his phone to contact his secretary."Issue an
 

announcement immedliately," he commanded. "State that Sarah Johnson's work has been signed by Philip Investment Group. Ensure the news reaches all major media outlets."

I sat nearby with my legs crossed, a subtle smile playing on my lips. How amusing that men always love to appear imperious, as if the world revolves around their phone calls. At this moment, Philip was immersed ín his ridiculous "entrepreneur" role, entirely unaware he was merely following my script. The more desperately he tried to prove himself superior to Howard, the easier he was to manipulate. The vanity contests between men had always been my most effective weapon.

As I prepared to leave Philip's office, I told him, "You're busy with work,so I won't disturb you any longer."

"Alright," he responded without looking up, "be careful on your way home.
"

"Mm," I acknowledged briefly.

While driving home, I habitually took out my phone to check online updates. As my finger scrolled across the screen, I was drawn to the latest trending topics:

"White Family Publicly Announces Termination of All Collaboration Projects with Morgan Family"

Scrolling further, another explosive news item followed:

"Howard Technologies Announces Strategic Partnership with Morgan Family"

The comments section had already exploded:
 

"The White family has met their match this time!" "What's the White family compared to Howard Technologies?" "Finally someone dares to stand up against the White family's tyranny."

Seeing this information, I smirked contemptuously. Bill and his opportunistic family had picked the wrong fight this time. Howard wasn't someone who would allow himself to be bullied. Though I disliked him,I had to acknowledge his business acumen and assertiveness.

Parking beneath my apartment building, my thoughts shifted to my own future. Currently, the money Philip gave me barely covered daily expenses,far from the lavish lifestyle I'd enjoyed with Robert. Thinking about how comics might bring substantial income, I began planning in my mind:

First,shopping in Europe-Milan's spring collection should be on shelves now, and Paris's jewelry exhibition would start soon... Then vacations,perhaps renting a private island in the Maldives, making those Instagram socialites envious?

When I was with Robert, such luxuries were readily available. During the first few months after marriage, Philip also satisfied my every wish, until he realized my shopping desires were endless-those designer bags,custom jewelry, limited-edition watches... He began complaining I was "extravagant."


Then Philip's attitude changed completely. He appeared attentive on the surface but actually tightened his grip on the purse strings. "For the baby's sake," he started monitoring my every expenditure, as if I were a teenager incapable of managing my own finances.
Back in my apartment, I tossed my handbag aside and headed straight for the refrigerator to retrieve a bottle of champagne. This was a day worth celebrating. With a pop, the cork flew out, and I poured myself a full glass.
 

Checking my phone again, I discovered the online news had updated.Now there were not only reports about the White family and Howard but also news about me:


"Philip Investment Group Signs Comic Artist Sarah Johnson"

I scrolled to the comments section to see people's reactions:

"Sarah Johnson? Who's that?"

"Isn't she a comic artist who had some fame abroad a few years ago?"

"Her works once had some followers on niche platforms." "I heard she stopped drawing long ago, is she back now?"

There weren't many comments, but at least some people remembered me.
Compared to being completely forgotten, this was decent enough. I took a
large sip of champagne, celebrating this small victory.

I immediately logged into the exclusive account Philip had set up for me.Seeing the steadily increasing numbers of comic merchandise orders, I felt a dizzying joy. Philip's team moved quickly-the comic had just launched,and merchandise was already available for pre-order, though actual production hadn't begun.

This was an unexpected windfall. When I was with Robert, I started drawing comics merely out of boredom. Back then, I had nothing to do except spend money, and life was unbearably dull. Comics became my way of passing time, and although I didn't earn much then, I did gain some recognition.

Now, that reputation was finally turning into real money!

My fingers slid across the numbers on the screen, my heart racing. This

was just the beginning! If orders were already this numerous now, what about later? Would my income skyrocket? Would it surpass that self-righteous Annie's? Could I potentially earn hundreds of thousands, even millions per month?

What excited me most was anticipating the expression on Annie's self-important face. What gave her the right to such success? Nothing but support from that man Howard. Yet I could achieve even more without Howard. Imagining her jealousy and resentment when she saw herself surpassed by me made my blood boil with excitement.

I raised my glass, smiling gently at my reflection in the window. Comic income was just the first step-first defeat Annie, and then... perhaps Howard would also notice my talent and charm?

The thought of that high-and-mighty Howard ultimately falling for me while Annie could only watch from the sidelines was more satisfying than any amount of money.

Of course, this wasn't to say I needed to rely on him-I merely wanted to conquer him, possess him, prove I was more valuable than Annie.
 
###Chapter 128: Grandma Didn't Come to Destr oy Our Relationship

Brian's POV

I stood at the school gate, watching Lucy and Penny run toward Annie.They were holding hands and laughing. I felt a knot in my stomach.Lucy used to be so quiet before Annie came into her life. Now she was always smiling.

"Annie, I missed you so much!" Lucy shouted, her voice sounding really happy.

Annie bent down and hugged Lucy tight. Icould see Lucy's face over Annie's shoulder. She had that secret little smile kids get when they feel safe and loved.

Penny ran to her mom Sue at the same time. "Mommy! Guess what we did today?" she said excitedly, tellingher about some art thing they made.

My chest hurt watching them. I wasn't sure if I was jealous or just sad.When was the last time I felt that happy to see someone pick me up? I couldn't remember. Not since Mom and I lived together, that's for sure.

Howard walked up to Lucy and Penny. He looked less scary when he bent down to talk to them.

"Didn't you two want to know how toy airplanes fly?" he asked in a nice voice. "I've invited an engineer to come to our house and explain it to you."

Lucy looked super excited. Penny started jumping up and down.

Howard looked at Sue. "Penny can come too, if that's okay."
 

"Can I. Mom? Please?" Penny begged, putting her hands together like she was praying.

Sue smiled. "Of course. Just say thank you to Mr. Thompson."

"Thank you, Mr. Thompson!" Penny said quickly before turning to Lucy."
We're going to learn about airplanes!"

"This is going to be awesome!" Lucy shouted happily.

I watched Annie help Lucy into their fancy car. I could hear them laughing. Lucy was leaning against Annie like she completely trusted her.

Penny's only known Lucy for what, a couple months? And they're already like family.

That thought hurt more than I expected. I felt a lump in my throat. If Dad hadn't made me meet Sarah, maybe I'd be living with Mom at Howard's house by now. Maybe Lucy would be like my little sister instead of someone I just watch from far away.

I felt really left out. They all looked so happy together. Like a real family.

I climbed into my own car where Mitchell waited patiently behind the wheel.

"Can we follow them?" I asked,trying to sound casual.

Mitchell turned in his seat, his expression gentle but firm. "Your grandmother has probably prepared dinner and is waiting for you to come home."

I considered arguing but then nodded reluctantly. Mitchell was right.Grandma Ruth had been cooking all my favorite foods lately, trying so
 .hard to make me feel at home. The least I could do was show up on time.

"Okay," I agreed. "Let's go home."

Mitchell smiled and was about to start the engine when someone knocked on my window. I turned, expecting to see maybe Ms. Taylor or one of my classmates.


Instead, I found myself staring into the face of my father.

I felt really angry seeing him there. I hadn't seen him in weeks. I missed him, just a bit. Then I told myself to stay calm. He was still my father,after all. Maybe I was being too hard on him.

I pressed the button to lower my window. "Yes?" I asked, trying to keep my voice normal. "Do you need something?"

Dad looked different somehow-tired, maybe, or stressed. For a moment,I felt a little sorry for him. Maybe I'm being too hard on him, I thought.Adults have problems too.

"Your grandmother came to see me," he began, running a hand through his carefully styled hair. "She wanted me to record a video stating that I was cutting ties with you."

"Oh?" I replied, my heart suddenly racing. Was he finally letting me go?Would I be free of this painful back-and-forth?

"I recorded it," he continued, his tone suggesting he'd done something
incredibly generous. "But you're my biological son, Brian. How could I
possibly abandon you? She's trying to destroy our father-sonrelationship!"

My brief moment of understanding broke instantly. How could he say that?After everything he'd done-leaving Mom, choosing Sarah over us,
ignoring me for months-how could he act like Grandma Ruth was the bad person?

I couldn't hold back anymore. "But you already abandoned me before Grandma came to see you, didn't you?"

His expression hardened. "That's not true. I've always taken care of you."

"Dad," I said, the word feeling strange in my mouth, "do I need to remind you how you treated me after you divorced mom?"

Something that looked like guilt crossed his face before he got annoyed."You're too young to understand grown-up stuff."

But I did understand. I understood more than he thought. Grandma had told me how Mom had helped him when he was starting his company,how she'd believed in him when nobody else did. But to him, she was just a housewife who didn't matter. And when Sarah came back, he threw her away like she was nothing.

"When Sarah bullied me, I told you about it," I said, my voice flat and emotionless. "But you said it was my problem and got mad at me instead."

Dad's face flushed. "That's not what happened-"

"Grandma Betty likes the baby in Sarah's belly more than me," I continued,cutting him off. "You do too. You always take his side."

"Brian,that's-"

"You said you wouldn't give me another cent," I reminded him. "Those were your exact words."

His mouth opened and closed, but no sound came out.
 .

"When you said that. I felt like my brain just... stopped working,"I admitted. "But now I accept that we're not father and son anymore."

I looked straight into his eyes. "Grandma didn't come to destroy our relationship. She just wanted evidence. You can't destroy something that doesn't exist anymore."

Dad's expression darkened. "The money from your mother may cover for your basic needs, but who pays for Mitchell?" he asked, gesturing toward the driver. "If you're really cutting ties with me, then I won't be paying his salary anymore."

I smiled slightly. "The money you paid him last month? I already had him return it to you. Didn't you receive it?"

Dad pulled out his phone, frantically checking something. His eyes widened as he apparently found the transaction record showing Mitchell's salary had indeed been refunded. He looked up at me, genuinely shocked.

I felt calm watching him be so surprised. A few months ago, I would have been scared of losing Mitchell and would have begged Dad not to take him away. But not after he had recorded that video.

"Is there anything else?" I asked politely. "Grandma made dinner, and she's waiting for me."

Dad seemed to struggle for words. "Brian... I'm still your biological father...



"No," I replied, my voice quiet but firm. "You're Max's dad. You're Sarah's husband. You're not mine."

I turned to Mitchell. "Let's go home."

As the car pulled away. I saw Dad in the side mirror, standing alone on the sidewalk. For a moment. I felt a little sad. But then I remembered Mom's face, and Lucy's kindness, and Grandma Ruth's warm hugs.

No.I want my Mom back!
 
###Chapter 129: The Unexpected Visitor

Annie's POV

I reclined in the lounge chair in the backyard of Howard's mansion,watching Lucy and Penny finish their training session on the immaculately maintained lawn. Thomas Anderson had'arrived ten minutes late, but seeing the girls in good form.

"Their physical endurance is improving rapidly," Thomas said to me, his gaze fixed on the girls. "I believe they're ready for more intensive training now."

The moment Lucy heard this, she threw her hands up in excitement. "That's awesome! I want to run farther!" she exclaimed.

I couldn't help but smile, exchanging an amused glance with Howard.

The training that followed was indeed more intense. The overall training extended to half an hour. When it ended, both girls collapsed like rag dolls on the neatly trimmed grass, breathing heavily.

I noticed my own physical condition had improved significantly.During my time with Philip, I barely exercised, trapped in the house all day, my physical state deteriorating. Now, living with Lucy and Howard, I'd not only regained my former vitality but could effortlessly carry Lucy back to the living room.

Sue was visibly more exhausted than I was, with beads of sweat on her forehead,but she still prepared to lift Penny. Just then, Thomas stepped forward and naturally picked up the little girl.
"Let me," he smiled at Sue."You should rest."
 

Sue didn't pretend to be strong; she simply responded with genuine gratitude: "Thank you."


"You're welcome," he replied, his tone carrying a natural warmth.

Watching Thomas carry Penny, I suddenly realized he might be playing more than just the role of a coach in Sue and Penny's lives. There seemed to be an unspoken understanding between single mother Sue and considerate Thomas. This made me happy for Sue, yet somewhat concerned. After all, I knew too well the risks of trusting a new man.

Back inside. Howard's household staff had prepared dinner. We sat in the spacious dining area, dividing into two tables since one couldn't accommodate everyone. Lucy and Penny naturaly sat together.

"When airplanes fly very high, do they reach the end of the sky?"

"If the moon follows us wherever we go, how does it know where we're heading?"

"Does Lucy's teddy bear secretly get up at night to drink milk? My toys sometimes change positions!"

The children's questions fired like a string of firecrackers, with Thomas and Howard taking turns to answer. Even the usually serious Howard displayed rare patience and gentleness when responding to Lucy. The entire house filled with laughter.

This feels good, I thought quietly to myself.

After dinner, Lucy ran to my side, her eyes sparkling with excitement."Mom! Mom!" Every time she called me that, my heart melted a little.
I gently stroked her hair. "What is it, sweetheart?"

"Can we play 'Hide and Seek Relay'? Please!" she pleaded eagerly,bouneing with barely contained excitement. This was a hybrid game currently popular at her Upper East Side private preschool,combining traditional hide-and-seek with team relay elements that children adored.

"Of course we can!" I agreed without hesitation. Seeing her bright eyes, I couldn't help thinking I'd do anything to keep her this happy.

Meanwhile, Penny was executing her "mission"-convincing Sue to participate. This required minimal effort; Sue was completely devoted to her daughter and naturally wouldn't refuse. Sue's and my eyes met, and we both shared that resigned yet sweet smile-a silent understanding between mothers.

We moved to the spacious back garden. The temperature was perfect for outdoor activities.

Howard volunteered to be the "Treasure Director," which surprised me.The normally expressionless CEO who dominated Manhattan's business circles now held carefully prepared clue cards, smiling as he created riddles for the children. The rules required each person to find their"treasure," then exchange and relay with team members to find the next one.His entire demeanor radiated a vitality I'd never witnessed before, his eyes revealing a rare childlike innocence.

Sue and I formed a team against the children, while Thomas and Howard played "Riddle Masters," sometimes offering help, sometimes creating distractions. With each new clue revealed, Lucy and Penny would cheer excitedly, holding hands as they rushed to the next location. They sprinted across the garden lawn, their little faces flushed with excitement.
"The next clue is next to 'something that flies but isn't a bird'!" Lucy read from the card, then exchanged confused glances with Penny.
 

"It's the airplane models!" Penny suddenly realized, pointing to Howard's vintage airplane model display cabinet in the garden corner.

About ten minutes later, we "adults" began feeling tired, though Lucy and Penny seemed to have endless energy. Just then, the butler came out to inform Howard that the teacher he'd arranged had arrived.

Howard nodded and took Lucy's hand. "Come on, the aerospace engineer is here to teach you about airplanes."

We returned to the living room to meet a woman in her thirties wearing glasses. Her hair was meticulously arranged in a neat bun, and she emanated a serious scholarly aura, her gaze sharp enough to pierce through someone.

"Hello, I'm Jane Buffey," she addressed Howard directly. "Which two children want to learn how an airplane works?"

Hearing this serious voice, both girls immediately hid. Lucy grabbed the edge of my skirt, peeking out with just her little head. I could feel her slight trembling and the tightness of her grip.

Penny went further, completely hiding behind Sue. Seeing the children's reaction, I worried for them-lessons should be joyful experiences, not sources of fear.

Howard seemed unconcerned by the children's timidity. He walked over and gently but firmly took both little girls' hands, bringing them before Jane Buffey."These two."

Jane Buffey noticed the children's fear and forced a smile. "Go get your toy airplanes."
"Huh?" Lucy looked up in surprise, curiosity replacing fear in her eyes."
 

We can play with our toy airplanes?"

"Of course," Jane Buffey answered calmly.

Just that simple permission completely changed the atmosphere. With approval granted, Lucy immediately grabbed Penny's hand. "Quick,let's get the planes!" The two little girls dashed upstairs, their fear of the teacher vanishing in their excitement.

Jane Buffey turned to Howard, her expression still serious."I'll take care of them from here."

"Thank you." Howard responded appropriately and sincerely.Howard had explained to me on our way back that this teacher was a renowned aerospace engineer whom most people couldn't hire regardless of payment.She seemed to have accepted the job for some personal reason.

Hearing Howard's words, the teacher's expression softened slightly. "Thank you."

A few minutes later, the two girls rushed downstairs, excitedly clutching their remote-controlled airplanes. Knowing they were young, the teacher abandoned technical terminology, explaining flight principles in the most direct, simple way. I was surprised to find both girls not only quiet but focused, their eyes shining.

"Why are airplane wings curved?" Lucy raised her hand to ask.

"Where does the wind go in?" Penny followed with her own question.

Whenever they didn't understand something, they eagerly raised their hands. The teacher seemed touched by their curiosity and thirst for knowledge. Her originally serious expression gradually melted, and her explanations became more animated.
 

"I thought little girls only liked playing with dolls," she whispered to Howard and me.


I sat down on the nearby sofa, quietly observing the scene. Under the warm lights, Lucy and Penny controlled their remote airplanes while the teacher occasionally guided them to adjust angles or explained certain component functions. When the planes landed, the three huddled together,examining each part like professional engineers.

Sue sat beside me, unusually relaxed, leaning back with a satisfied sigh. "If only every day could be this easy."

"Then come here every day after school," I sincerely suggested, not just so Lucy could have a friend, but to help Sue. "Lucy loves Penny, and there's always someone here to help look after the children."

Sue nodded without hesitation. "Sounds good."

We sat quietly, enjoying this rare moment of peace, occasionally exchanging knowing smiles prompted by the children's laughter or exclamations.

Just then, the sound of a door opening caught my attention. I turned to see a woman's silhouette pushing open the mansion door. She was tall and slender, with dark hair falling neatly down her back, dressed in a well-tailored dark suit. From her posture and the line of her shoulders,I sensed an innate confidence and elegance.

She walked directly to Howard, saying something quietly. Due to the distance and the noise of the game, I couldn't hear her voice or see her face.Howard simply nodded without any pleasantries, then turned to lead her through the hallway directly to his private study at the far end of the first floor. The heavy oak door closed behind them, shutting out all sound.
 

A strange feeling rose in my heart-not jealousy, more like uncertainty.Howard had never mentioned having other guests tonight.

Sue had clearly noticed too. She frowned and asked me softly, "Who is she?Do you know her?"


"No," I answered, trying to keep my voice steady while turning away."But she might be a relative. Otherwise, she wouldn't come to Howard's home so late."


Sue studied my expression, seemingly seeing through my forced composure. "Aren't you worried?" she asked quietly, concern in her eyes.

"What if she's not a relative," Suehesitated, "but someone Howard..."
 

###Chapter 130: Do You Hate Me?

Howard's POV

I studied my sister Selena as she sat across from me in my study, her slender fingers nervously tapping against the leather armrest. Her dark hair fell in perfect waves around her shoulders,framing a face that bore our family's trademark strong features softened by feminine grace. The Thompson genes were unmistakable.

My thoughts drifted back to several hours earlier. Annie and I had just picked Lucy up from school, the three of us walking toward the car when my phone rang. Seeing Selena's name on the screen, I motioned for Annie to take Lucy ahead.

"Go on inside with Lucy," I told Annie quietly. "I need to take this."

Annie nodded and guided Lucy toward the house. I remained by the car,watching them walk away before answering the call.

"Howard Thompson," I answered, my tone neutral as always.

"Brother," Selena's voice came through, sounding both hesitant and concerned. "Did Annie's former mother-in-law come to your company to cause trouble for her?"

The question caught me by surprise. My sister rarely involved herself in my personal affairs, and certainaly not with this level of specific detail.

"Yes," I replied simply, wondering how she'd obtained this information.

"What happened?" Selena pressed, genuine concern evident in her voice.

I decided there was no point in concealing what was becoming widely
 

known anyway. "Annie's ex-husband is Philip Baker, the investment company CEO. Betty is Philip's mother."

"I see!" Selena's voice registered recognition. "But why would she want to cause trouble for Annie?"


I took a measured breath, organizing my thoughts before responding. "Philip's current wife is named Sarah. She was the third party who destroyed Philip and Annie's marriage. But after Philip got together with Sarah, he suddenly realized the person he truly wanted was still Annie."

The memory of Annie's pain stirred something dark within me-a cold anger I rarely allowed myself to feel. But I quickly suppressed it. Annie didn't need my pity; she needed my support and understanding.

"Sarah watches Philip obsessing over Annie every day, and she's realized that if she continues to blindly follow Philip, eventually he'll discard her,"I continued, my voice even despite my distaste for discussing such petty drama. "So she's actively looking for her next patron-someone to finance her expensive lifestyle. Unfortunately, I've become her target."

There was irony in Sarah's calculation, and I couldn't help but find it somewhat darkly amusing. The woman's self-perception was remarkably inflated,believing every man would fall at her feet.

"She constantly creates situations trying to damage my relationship with Annie," I explained. "But Annie effortlessly neutralizes each attempt. This infuriates Sarah, so I guess she runs to Betty, distorting the truth and claiming Annie has targeted her. Betty, wanting to defend her daughter-in-law,came to our company building, making a scene andattempting to damage Annie's reputation. Annie simply called the police."
Thinking about Annie's decisive handling of the situation, I felt a surge of

admiration. She was no longer the woman who would silently endure mistreatment-she had learned to stand up for herself.

"However,Betty is rather stubborn," I added. "Even knowing that Sarah instigated everything, she still believes Sarah is blameless and Annie is at fault. In reality, Annie's mind is completely occupied with work and Lucy."

And me. of course, I thought to myself, the corner of my mouth lifting slightly at the unspoken addition.

After a long pause, Selena hesitantly asked, "So you're saying that all of Betty's efforts are essentially paving the way for Sarah? Making it easier for Sarah to marry you?"

"Yes," I acknowledged simply.

"Does Philip know about this?" Selena's voice held disbelief.

"Probably not." I answered, while mentally adding that Philip didn't even know the child in Sarah's womb wasn't his. That secret would eventually become Annie's most powerful trump card.
Changing the subject, I asked,"How did you find out about all this?"

"Because Betty came to our Long Island house," Selena revealed frankly."She was trying to convince Mother to create problems for Annie."
"Oh?" I kept my tone neutral, though this information was concerning.

"Don't worry," Selena quickly added. "Mother didn't believe them."

I knew my mother was easily influenced by others. I suspected the only reason MMother hadn't been swayed was because Selena had been present.
"Thank you," I said simply.
 

"We're siblings," Selena replied, sounding slightly embarrassed."No need for such formality."

I deliberately slowed my speech, "Isn't your company currently lacking business partners?"

Selena seemed surprised by my sudden change of topic but answered honestly,"Yes,we are."

"Are you free today?" I asked calmly.

After a moment's consideration. Selena replied enthusiastically, "Of course!"

"I have several projects that were originally intended for collaboration with Philip," I said evenly. "After careful evaluation, I believe your company could handle them just as well. Come to my house, and we can discuss the details."

Selena's excitement was palpable through the phone. "Brother, I'll be there after dinner!"

Now,hours later, Selena sat across from me in my study, her eyes wide with disbelief as she stared at me.
"Don't you hate me?" she asked, her voice smaller than I'd heard it in years.

This was clearly a question that had been weighing on her mind for some tíme.

"Why would I hate you?" I asked, genuinely puzzled.

Selena lowered her voice, as though confessing something shameful."Well,Mother had originally planned to the company to me and nothing to you."

She explained that she knew many families had been permanently divided over inequitable distributions of family assets. She'd assumed that even if I didn't outright hate her. I would certainly want nothing to do with her.

I couldn't help but smile slightly at her concern. "You think I would care about such trivial interests?"

"I suppose not," Selena admitted, visibly relieved that I still cared about her.

She looked at me reproachfully. "Then why didn't you tell me sooner? I've wanted to collaborate with you for a long time but was afraid to bring it up. I was worried you might still resent the company situation."

Selena explained that while our last interaction had suggested I wasn't holding a grudge. she still feared I was merely being diplomatic, that I truly did resent her. After all, beyond discussing the company's issues. I hadn't offered her much substantial assistance.
Looking at her troubled expression, I couldn't suppress a small laugh."In your mind, is your brother really so petty?"
"Not exactly," Selena responded without hesitation. "It's just that most people around me would care about company ownership, and they'd fight for it. I subconsciously assumed you'd be like everyone else."
I gave her a mildly exasperated look. "I've watched you grow up since you were a child. You should know what kind of person I am."
Selena flashed an ingratiating smile. "Well, when substantial interests are involved..."
I found her perspective somewhat tiresome, but in my view, these matters were in the past. There was no point in dwelling on them.
 

Without changing my expression. I said, "I should warn you about one thing. With others, my requirements might not be particuarly high. But you're different-you're my sister. So I'll be more demanding with you."

Selena understood thatI merely wanted her to approach these projects with seriousness. My hope was that through these collaborations,she would gain valuable experience and knowledge. This way.even if we stopped working together in the future, she would have the skills to succeed on her own.

Without hesitation, Selena replied, "No problem."

I handed her a stack of documents. "Take these project collaboration proposals back with you, develop them, and submit them to me.I'll review them for you."

Selena accepted the files with evident pleasure. "I will."

With my guidance to sharpen her abilities, it wouldn't be long before her skills would be among the best in the industry.
Selena could barely conceal her smile. "Brother, I promise I'll put two hundred percent effort into these projects! It's getting late, so I should be going now!"

"Very well," I replied.

I escorted Selena to the door,glancing at my watch-it was already nine-thirty at night.
After seeing Selena off, my thoughts no longer lingered on Sarah and Betty's schemes but shifted to Annie. I wondered if she remembered our agreement from earlier today about spending the night together. The thought stirred a pleasant anticipation within me.
 

I left my study and headed toward the living room, hoping that Annie had already put Lucy to bed so we could have some time alone.
 
###Chapter 131:Because of You

Annie's POV

After tucking Lucy in, I gently pulled the covers up to her chin and watched her peaceful expression for a moment. She looked so serene in sleep, her golden hair splayed across the pillow, her small chest risingand falling with each breath. It amazed me how quickly she had become such an important part of my life, how effortlessly she had claimed a piece of my heart.

I leaned down to place a soft kiss on her forehead before quietly making my way to the door. As I stepped into the hallway, carefully closing Lucy's bedroom door behind me, I caught sight of Howard standing in the doorway of his study.

Our eyes met across the distance. The intensity of his gaze made my heart beat a little faster, yet I hesitated, uncertain whether to approach him or continue on my way. We stood there for a moment, silently regarding each other in the dim hallway light.
Howard gestured toward the balcony."Shall we talk?"

"Sure," I replied simply, my voice barely above a whisper.

The balcony was spacious, with a small table and two chairs positioned to take advantage of the view. The lighting was bright enough to illuminate us clearly while the darkness beyond the property line created a sense of privacy, as if we were enclosed in our own little world.
I settled comfortably into one of the chairs, but Sue's earlier words kept circling in my mind: "What if she's not a relative, but someone Howard..."Her unfinished insinuation had planted a seed of unease that I couldn't
 

quite shake. I wasn't normally a suspicious person, but when you've been deeply hurt before, that kind of sensitivity becomes almost reflexive.

Taking a deep breath, I decided to address it directly. "Howard, who was that woman talking with you in your study earlier?"

The moment the question left my lips, I found myself tensely observing Howard's reaction. I had grown accustomed to Philip's impatience or even anger whenever I asked such questions. But Howard's expression showed no displeasure.

He moved closer to me, answering with an easy casualness that surprised me. "That was Selena, my sister."

I felt a wave of relief wash over me, along with a twinge of surprise at my own emotional response. I had begun to trust Howard during our time together, yet Sue's suggestion had so easily sown seeds of doubt in my mind.

Howard was quiet for a long moment, then he reached for my hand.His voice was calm but firm. "But a relationship won't last if two people communicate through guesswork rather than honest conversation."

His words caught me off guard.

In that moment, I suddenly realized how deeply my six years of marriage to Philip had affected me. I had grown accustomed to guessing rather than asking directly. Whenever I had inquired about the identities of people around him during our marriage, Philip would impatiently chastise me:"You always need to know who I'm talking to! Don't you understand how suffocating that is? It feels like I have no personal space! Like I'm being monitored constantly!"
 

Eventually, his complaints had escalated to threats: "If you don't change this behavior, we might as well get divorced."

I had learned my lesson and stopped asking questions. I had even convinced myself this was the right approach.

Looking up into Howard's eyes now, seeing the sincerity there, I felt a warmth spreading through me. He was so different, not only refraining from criticism of my curiosity but actively encouraging direct questions.

"Thank you for understanding," I smiled. "So, about your sister,can you tell me more about her?"

Howard's expression softened, his face taking on a reminiscent quality. "Selena is a few years younger than me. We have an older brother,William-Lucy's father-but he was much older than us,so we rarely played together as children. Selena and I were closer in age, so our connection was stronger. She was incredibly cute as a child, and I was always proud of her. I would often boast to others, 'Look at my adorable little sister-you don't have a sister like her."

There was a warmth in his voice I had never heard before as he recounted these memories.

I found myself drawn to this side of Howard's past, a facet I had never seen before. I remained quiet, listening intently.
The joy in Howard's voice gradually faded. "This harmonious relationship was broken by my mother in the year my brother died."
He paused, considering how to continue.

Curiously, I asked, "What happened?"
 

"She was worried I would compete with Selena for the family company, so she suddenly sent me away, then publicly announced that the company would be inherited by Selena." Howard leaned against the railing,gazing into the distance.

I found this puzzling. "Didn't you already have your own company by then?"

Howard nodded. "Yes. If they had discussed it with me beforehand,I would never have objected to Selena inheriting. But my mother didn't trust me.Selena had no previous experience and was suddenly pushed into a management position; she was completely overwhelmed. I couldn't bear to see my sister struggle, so I told my mother that Selena could seek my advice if needed. But my mother accused me of trying to use this opportunity to take the company away from Selena. After that, I realized I couldn't say anything about my sister or the family company anymore,or they would suspect I had ulterior motives regarding Selena's company."

It was under these circumstances that Howard suddenly felt like an outsider in his own family. "I just wanted to support her, help her understand company operations, make her work easier."
Hearing the desolation in his voice, I hesitated for a moment, then stepped forward to embrace him.

Howard didn't reject my gesture; instead, he gently pulled me closer, his pace of speech slowing. "During that time, I lost my brother, and my mother and sister became increasingly distant. It seemed Lucy was the only family member who would never betray me. That's why she's so important to me. Though she's not my biological daughter, she means more to me than any biological child ever could."
I patted his back gently,offering wordless comfort.
 

Howard continued explaining, "Because of my mother, I avoided contacting my sister. And Selena worried that I resented her for obtaining the company that didn't belong to her. She was concerned I felt uncomfortable about the situation, so she avoided contact as well."

I commented sincerely, "I had no idea such a misunderstanding existed between you."

"Yes," Howard gripped my shoulders, creating a small distance between us so he could look directly into my eyes.

His tone became more serious than I had ever heard. "What I learned from this experience is that if you want a relationship to last,you need to communicate clearly. Otherwise, if misunderstandings are allowed to persist, even the strongest feelings will eventually disappear."

On this point, I completely agreed with Howard's perspective. "What finally prompted you to resolve the misunderstanding?"

Howard gave my cheek a gentle squeeze. "Because of you."
 
###Chapter 132: Of Course I Won't Let You Go

Annie's POV

"Because of you," Howard said, his gray eyes fixed intently on mine.

Confused,I asked,"Me?"

Howard's lips curved into a subtle smile as he explained, "Betty went specifically to see my mother tonight to stir up trouble, trying to turn her against you. Selena happened to be staying at the family house and overheard Betty's conversation. She found it ridiculous." His thumb traced a gentle pathalong my jawline. "And in fact, my mother was actually beginning to waver. After Betty left, Selena immediately reasoned with her.She convinced my mother not to believe Betty's words. Only after confirming that my mother had completely abandoned any notion of causing trouble for you did Selena call to report the situation to me."
The revelation surprised me. I hadn't realized how far Betty was willing to go to drive a wedge between Howard and me. It seemed the woman's animosity toward me knew no bounds.

Howard's thumb continued its gentle caress against my cheek. "Annie,since you entered my life, it seems I've experienced nothing but good fortune."

I didn't contradict him but instead gazed sincerely into his eyes. There was something about Howard that made me feel both vulnerable and utterly safe. The way he looked at me-as if I were precious beyond measure-still took my breath away.
Howard cupped my face in his hands and slowly lowered his head to kiss me. His warm lips pressed against mine with a tenderness that made my
 

heart race. I closed my eyes, surrendering to the sensation of his kiss,allowing myself to simply feel rather than think.

"Do you remember our agreement from this afternoon?" Howard whispered against my ear, his voice low and husky with barely concealed desire that sent shivers down my spine.

I certainly remembered. The memory of our conversation in his office earlier today, when his fingers had unbuttoned just the first button of my blouse before I'd stopped him, promnising to "celebrate properly" tonight,flashed through my mind.The recollection alone was enough to make heat rise within me.

"I remember," I answered softly, feeling warmth spread from my abdomen throughout my body. "Shall we go to your room?"

Howard's arm encircled my waist, pulling me tightly against his body."How about right here?" he murmured, his teeth grazing my earlobe. "I can't wait any longer."

His urgency ignited a fire within me. I glanced around, taking in our surroundings. The balcony was on the top floor of the mansion,surrounded by dense trees that completely screened us from outside view.The night air was cool against my flushed skin, creating a delicious contrast to Howard's warmth.



"They won't," Howard interrupted, one hand already sliding beneath the hem of my dress, traveling upward along my thigh. "You kept avoiding my eyes this morning, Annie. That's not a good habit."
His fingers traced along my inner thigh, giving a light, punishing squeeze
 

to the sensitive skin there, making me draw in a sharp breath.

"I didn't want the employees to notice," I gasped in response, my hands climbing to his shoulders for support.

"Notice what?" Howard demanded, while one hand had already undone my hair, letting it cascade down.

"Notice that I... miss your touch..." I confessed,no longer hiding my desire.

Howard seemed satisfied with this answer; his lips instantly covered mine,no longer gently exploring but claiming me with fierce possession. His tongue invaded my mouth, tangling with mine, mimicking more intimate actions. His hands simultaneously roamed my body, his movements both urgent and precise. He no longer needed to discover my sensitive spots-after our intimate encounters, he knew my body perfectly. His palm covered my breast, kneading through the thin fabric, while his lips moved from my mouth to my neck, leaving a trail of hot, wet kisses.

"Howard..." I moaned, my hands already instinctively pulling his shirt from his waistband, desperate to feel his skin.
He suddenly turned me around, pressing me against the balcony railing,embracing me from behind. "Look," he rasped in my ear, "al of New York is at our feet."

The city lights spread out before us like fallen stars, while the real stars twinkled overhead. This visual spectacle, combined with Howard's kisses behind my ear and along my neck, made me tremble all over.
His hand snaked around to my front, deftly unbuttoning my blouse,though only enough to allow his hand entry. His palm was scorching as it covered my stomach before moving upward, finally finding its target and
 

drawing an uncontrollable moan from me.

"Quiet," he bit my earlobe gently. "unless you want all the staff to hear."

Rather than calming me, his words added a forbidden thrill. I turned to face him, pulling him toward me, my hands impatiently unfastening his belt while our lips connected once more.

Howard suddenly lifted me, positioning my legs around his waist. I could feel his hardness pressing against my most sensitive area. He carried me the few steps to a lounger in thecorner of the balcony, and we tumbled down together, our limbs entwined.

The lounger creaked softly, but we were well beyond caring. Howard's hand started at my knee, moving along mny thigh, all the way up until he found my core. His fingers explored there, each touch sending tremors throughout my body.

"You're... especially passionate today," I said breathlessly,my fingers wandering across his chest,exploring the contours of every muscle.

"Because I saw Philip outside the company earlier," Howard admitted frankly, his movements never ceasing. "It made me realize I need to proclaim to the world that you're mine."

This expression of possessiveness both thrilled and challenged me.Before I could respond, he had already lowered his head, his mouth and tongue exploring downward to find the sensitive spots on my chest. I had to bite my finger to prevent myself from making too much noise.
"Howard... I need..." I whispered urgently, my hands gripping his shoulders.
He understood my meaning, his movements suddenly becoming more
 

insistent. Ourclothes were already in disarray, though not completely removed. This half-covered state somehow added to the forbidden excitement.

When he finally joined with me completely, the feeling of being utterly filled mnade my vision blur. Howard began to move, slowly but powerfully,each thrust precisely hitting my most sensitive spot, causing me to shudder continuously.

My hands clutched the edges of the lounger, my hips rising to meet his rhythm. Howard's gaze locked onto my expression, seemingly enjoying watching me surrender to him.

"Look at me, Annie," he commanded, simultaneously increasing his pace. "I want to see your eyes."
I forced myself to open my eyes, meeting his gaze. In this intimate stare,I felt an unprecedented connection, not just physical but spiritual as well.
Pleasure washed over me like waves, my body tensing, every inch of skin becoming hypersensitive. Howard noticed my change, his movements becoming more dominant as he lowered himself, his mouth and tongue continuing to tease my breasts, pushing me toward the peak.
When my climax arrived, I could barely control my voice. Howard immediately covered my lips with his, swallowing my moans,while reaching his own peak, his body deeply embedded within mine.
In the afterglow, we remained tightly embraced, our sweat and breath mingling. Howard's hand gently stroked my back, soothing my slightly trembling muscles.
"Annie," he whispered against my ear, his voice carrying a rare

vulnerability. "I've spent so much effort winning you."

His eyes gleamed with sincerity in the moonlight, "Of course I won't let you go."

I nestled in his arms. skin against skin. feeling his strong heartbeat.In that moment, I realized I could nolonger leave,this man-not just because of the intense physical attraction. but because he made me feel safe,cherished.and complete.
 
###Chapter 133: Give Me Some Time to Coside This Issue

Philip's POV

I parked my car at the street corner near Howard's mansion, killing both the engine and lights. Night had fallen, with only a few streetlamps casting their silent glow. My eyes remained fixated on that magnificent building.particularly on the second-floor balcony bathed in soft light.

Suddenly, I saw her-Annie. My heart skipped a beat. She stood on the balcony wearing only a thin white dress that fluttered gently in the evening breeze. She looked more beautiful than before. My throat tightened.and an irrepressible longing washed over me.

Then Howard appeared, embracing her from behind. My fingers dug deep into the steering wheel. He kissed the side of her neck, and I watched Annie tilt her head back, her expression revealing pure enjoyment. An expression I'd never seen on her face before. Throughout our six years of marriage, I'd treated every intimate moment with her as an obligation.Now, in another man's arms, she radiated happiness and desire I'd never witnessed.

"No..." I whispered, my voice sounding unnaturally hollow inside the car.

Howard's hands began to wander, and Annie responded eagerly. I should look away, I knew that. But my gaze remained fixed, as if witnessing a car crash-knowing it would cause pain, yet unable to resist watching until the end.

He turned her around, pressing her against the railing. From a distance, I thought I could hear Annie's laughter. That laughter was like a sharp
 

dagger piereing my heart. I had never made her laugh like that.When she was with me, she was always cautious, always considering too much.

Their movements grew increasingly passionate, their clothes disheveled.My vision blurred as tears welled up uncontrollably. I quickly wiped them away with my sleeve, unwilling to miss a single moment, even though each image was torturing me.

"Annie..." I called out softly, my voice choked.

A storm of emotions swept through me: regret, jealousy, pain, anger... and a profound sense of loss. When Howard lifted Annie intohis arms,my fist unconsciously pounded the steering wheel, producing a dull thud.Through my dizziness, I realized this was likely how they spent every night together. And me? I was left with a cold bed and endless nights.
They eventually disappeared from the balcony, presumably returning to the bedroom. I sat motionless in my car, feeling as if my chest had been hollowed out. This was the first time I truly realized I had lost her. Not because of the divorce papers we'd signed, but because her heart and body now belonged to someone else.

Tears rolled down silently, and I didn't even have the strength to wipe them away.
I don't know how long I sat there before finally driving back to my apartment. The moment I entered, the empty rooms reminded me of my bleak reality. No welcoming Annie, no Brian's laughter, just the echo of my own footsteps.
I mechanically removed my coat and walked to the living room bar,pouring myself a glass of whiskey. The alcohol burned my throat but couldn't warm my cold heart. I collapsed heavily onto the sofa, the glass
 

tilting dangerously in my hand.

My mind couldn't shake the image of Annie in Howard's embrace. Once upon a time, she had tried to embrace me with the same passion. And what did I do? I always found excuses to push her away: too busy with work.too tired, or simply pretending not to notice her hints.

"What have I done?" I asked the empty room, my voice echoing off the walls.

I had invested all my emotions in the fantasy of Sarah, that so-called"unattainable love" from my college days. I thought being with her would make my life perfect. But the reality was that an unbridgeable gap had always existed between us. And by the timne I realized this, Annie had already left my life.

I gulped down the remaining whiskey, the alcohol beginning to take effect,making my thoughts more chaotic yet somehow bolder. Howard also had his own "unattainable love"-my private investigator's information was absolutely certain about this. When that woman returned, Howard would inevitably abandon Annie for her. When that day came, I would be there,waiting to comfort Annie, to win back her heart.

I needed to ensure Annie remembered my existence. Not as the cold husband I once was, but as the Philip who could give her happiness.
Suddenly,an idea flashed through my mind-Sarah's comics! Since her work had been signed to my company, I could use this as a pretext to frequently visit Howard Technologies, to report progress to Annie. This way,I could not only see her but also demonstrate how generous my support for Sarah was.
When Annie compared me to Howard, she would realize I was the more
 

reliable choice. This plan was flawless!

I picked up my phone and dialed Sarah's number. The ringing tone sounded several times before she answered.

"What's the matter, calling so late?" Sarah's voice revealed impatience.

I asked directly: "How much funding do you need to promote your comics?



"How much?" I could hear the surprise in her voice.

"Give me a number," I urged, "enough to make your comics surpass Annie's in scale."

There was silence on the other end of the line. I could imagine Sarah calculating in her mind.
"A fairly... substantial figure," she answered cautiously, seemingly testing my limits.

"Be specific."

"If we're talking about comprehensive promotion, including online and offline channels, merchandise development, and international markets..."her tone gradually becamne excited, "it would require a very significant investment."

I understood her implication. "Then I'll give you enough funding to ensure your comics are more successful, more popular than Annie's."
Another silence followed, then Sarah asked in a tone I'd never heard before,filled with longing: "Can you really give me that much?"
"I can, but there are conditions," I said coolly. "This money must be used
 

entirely for your career development. You'll be fully responsible for promotion and production, and you won't ask me for additional funds."

"Of course!" Sarah immediately guaranteed, her voice barely concealing her excitement. "I'll make my work the national focus! People will see how good your investment vision is, how the projects you support are more successful than Howard's!" She paused briefly. "Annie will see it. She'll regret it!"


Her words hit the mark perfectly. "Go to the company tomorrow, and I'll have the finance department arrange the transfer," I promised.

As our call was about to end, Sarah suddenly spoke in a vulnerable voice:"Philip... even in the end, the person you love is stil1 Annie."

This change caught me off guard.

"But I still love you," she continued, her voice carrying a hint of choking emotion. "I just want you to find happiness, even if the future doesn't include me."

This unexpected tenderness moved me somewhat. "Don't worry, even if Annie and I reconcile, I won't abandon you and the child."
"But if you still have contact with me, Annie will be unhappy," Sarah said softly. "For your future.,. perhaps you should keep your distance from me.


"What about the child?" The question naturally slipped out.

"You can visit occasionally... but it's best to completely sever ties. That way,Annie won't have doubts or jealousy."
I fell into deep thought: "Give me some time to consider this issue."
 
###Chapter 134: Thank You,Robert

Robert Johnson's POV

I stared at the message on my phone screen, my brow furrowing. Sarah had just sent a new text to the Howard Thompson account on my phone.This account was specifically created at Howard's request for the purpose of communicating with Sarah.

I read her message: "Philip visits yourcompany looking for Annie every day. This must be quite annoying for you, right?"

The moment I saw this message, a painful realization struck me-after our breakup. Sarah had immediately begun pursuing various wealthy,powerful men. When my family's company declared bankruptcy, she left without a second thought. She only formally ended our relationship after confirming Philip genuinely wanted her.

I couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh. I had taken Sarah's feelings so seriously.: During our years together, I gave her everything she wanted unconditionally-mansions,luxury cars,jewelry,vacations-anything she pointed to, I immediately purchased.

But what was the result? When I loved her wholeheartedly, she was coldly calculating her benefits-as long as she could extract enough money from me,she would remain by my side. She never truly had a heart.
Just five minutes earlier, Sarah had told me in our private chat-the regular conversation between her and the real Robert Johnson-that she was tired and going to bed. Logically, she should be sound asleep right now, not energetically messaging "Howard." This stark contrast further confirmed Sarah's true nature.
 

1 didn't immediately reply to her message, instead quietly staring at the screen, my emotions churning. After a while, I saw Sarah had sent another message:

"I think Annie has no self-respect. Even though she already has an excellent man like you, she's still secretly in contact with her ex-husband."

Followed quickly by: "Unlike me... even though I have a boyfriend,I still maintain my dignity."

Reading these words, I couldn't help but laugh out loud: Sarah clearly believed she was communicating with the real Howard,completely unaware that it was actually me representing him. Howard had assigned me to manage this account precisely because he wanted to understand Sarah's genuine thoughts without directly engaging with her. The difference in Sarah's attitude toward different identities was so extreme it was almost absurd.

I had always thought Sarah maintained contact with me after our breakup because somewhere deep down she still loved me and couldn't completely let go. Perhaps, I consoled myself, I meant more to her than just money and status.

But now it seemed this was merely wishful thinking. Sarah was simply maintaining minimal investment to keep her mnost devoted admirer-me-on standby. If I ever managed to rebuild my family business and restore my wealth, she would likely return to my arms without hesitation. Howard understood this perfectly, which was one reason he assigned me to communicate with Sarah.

This realization brought a suffocating pain. I took a deep breath to calm myself, then began to reply: "Aren't you also in contact with me?"

Sarah immediately explained: "I contact you only because we're in similar situations."

"I don't think so," I responded with slight irritation.

I said this partly to provoke her, but mostly because I felt grateful toward Annie. It was a memory I preferred notato revisit-Philip had once delivered a drugged Annie to my studio, attempting to create a scandal.But even in that state, Annie maintained her clear judgment, saving not only herself but also me, preventing me from unknowingly making an irreparable mistake. That experience gave me profound insight into what an intelligent and strong woman Annie was. Afterward, I clearly saw that Annie had completely given up on Philip.

A new message from Sarah appeared on screen: "Perhaps Annie and Philip still have feelings for each other. They secretly contact each other without your knowledge... otherwise, why would someone as busy as Philip have time to visit your company to see Annie every day?"
I felt an ünprecedented revulsion. Sarah had already taken Philip from Annie-wasn't that enough? Now she wanted to steal Annie's current boyfriend, Howard. And then what? If Annie found another partner afterward, would Sarah continue to pursue like a predator?
With so many excellent men in the world, why did Sarah specifically target Annie's partners? What psychological mechanism lay behind such behavior? Was it pure malice,or some pathological competitive psychology?
I stared at the screen, feeling a wave of disgust, then decided to end the conversation: "Speaking like this in front of me only makes you appear despicable."
With that, I exited the chat application without waiting for Sarah's

response. I could imagine she might be surprised by "Howard's" defense of Annie, but I couldn't and didn't want to guess her specific thoughts.

I picked up my water glass from the table and walked to the window.Through the glass, I could see Manhattan's lights twinkling in the night.This city had witnessed my rise and fall-from heir to a family enterprise to now a bankrupt man.

I set down my phone and leaned back on the sofa, feeling a strange calmness. These disingenuous exchanges with Sarah left me exhausted, but they also gave me a clearer understanding of our long-finished relationship.

I picked up the documents from the table-an investment proposal Howard had sent. Even though my family business had gone bankrupt,Howard still valued my expertise and experience in the technology sector.This investment would help me start anew, creating my own small startup.Though its seale couldn't compare to what I had before, it represented a fresh beginning, independent of my family's reputation.
I glanced at my phone as Howard messaged asking about Sarah's reactions today. I briefly summarized our conversation, then added:"I'll continue this work, but hopefully not for too long."
Howard's reply came quickly: "Thank you, Robert. You're doing Annie and me a great favor. Tomorrow we can discuss investment details."

This simple affirmation brought a touch of warmth. I had lost everything once, but perhaps I was finding what truly mattered-honesty, dignity,and genuine professional respect. Even if Sarah only saw my wealth,people like Howard saw my abilities and value.
 
###Chapter 135: I Want to Be with Mom

Brian's POV

As I stepped out of the car, the front door swung open. and Grandma Ruth appeared, her face lighting up with genuine joy at the sight of me,which caught me off guard. Since Mom and*Dad's divorce, very few people had been genuinely happy to see me.

"You're home!" Grandma exclaimed as she hurried to the doorway to greet me.

"Yes!" I responded naturally, feeling a smile spread across my own face.

Grandma took my small backpack from my shoulder as we walked inside."I made the porridge today, but Ms. Taylor prepared the other dishes.Her cooking skills are truly remarkable. I watched her cook... somehow the same ingredients just become more appetizing in her hands."

I appreciated these simple family interactions-casual conversations with people who actually cared about me.

"Really?" I asked with interest.

"Of course! You'll taste for yourself," Grandma answered without hesitation,her eyes crinkling at the corners.
I immediately ran to the bathroom to wash my hands thoroughly, then sat at the dining table, surprised by the delicious spread of food before me.
"I haven't had such a satisfying meal in ages!" I exclaimed, my eyes widening at the sight. "When Mom was still with me, she always took such good care of me. She would always ask what I wanted to eat, and when I came home from school, the table would be filled with all my
 

favorite foods."

My voice gradually trailed off as I recalled the unpleasant memories that followed. "But after Dad and Mom divorced... when Dad wasn't home,even if Sarah cooked, she wouldn't let me eat. A few times, she even took Max out to dinner, leaving me alone at home. With nothing to eat, I could only search the refrigerator for leftovers. I'eventually got gastroenteritis and was hospitalized. Sarah told Dad it was because I ate too much...and Dad scolded me for it."

The first time this happened, I felt it was particularly unfair. I hadn't done anything wrong, yet Sarah could easily twist the facts. Gradually, I realized Sarah could do this without consequences primarily because Dad-Philip-indulged her. Whatever she did, Dad would forgive her. As for my feelings? Dad simply didn't care.

I endured this frustration for a long time until I moved out to live with Grandma. Only then did I discover life could be so much better. No more worrying about being inexplicably accused when I got home, no more worrying about having no dinner.

"Why didn't you tell me about these things earlier?" Grandma asked with concern, her brow furrowing with worry.
Seeing Grandma's worried expression, I felt a warmth in my heart."Because when these things happened, I told Dad. But Dad didn't believe anything I said. I thought, if even Dad-the person closest to me in the world-wouldn't stand by me, then surely no one would believe me."
After speaking, I unconsciously lowered my head.

Grandma sighed, gently stroking my hair: "Silly child, remember this: no matter what happens, I will always stand unconditionally by your side."

I looked up into Grandma's eyes, suddenly feeling an urge to cry. I nodded firmly: "Thank you, Grandma. You're the best!"

Our dinner began in a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere. Ms. Taylor ladled hot beef stew onto my plate: "Try the special sauce-I added a bit of rosemary."

"It smells amazing!" I didn't hesitate to pick up my fork,eager to taste it.

Mitchell cut a small piece of his home-baked bread and handed it to me:"I made this using Grandma's old recipe. See if it tastes like you remember."

"Oh, don't forget some salad," Grandma chimed in, adding some fresh vegetables to the side of my plate. "A balanced diet is important for growing children."

I looked at the generous portion of food on my plate, my eyes crinkling with happiness. Wanting to show my appreciation too, I poured orange juice for everyone. I carefully picked up the pitcher, serving each person from their right side, just as Mom had taught me.
"Thank you, little gentleman," Ms. Taylor said with a smile.

The conversation at the table was light and enjoyable. Mitchell recounted interesting things he'd seen while driving today, Ms. Taylor shared educational tips she'd recently discovered on Pinterest, and Grandma told stories from her youth. Laughter constantly echoed throughout the dining room.

As I ate, I wondered why I hadn't been closer to Grandma before.I remembered it was because Grandma Betty would often speak poorly of Mom and Grandma Ruth in front of me, calling them "poor relatives" and "parasites" who wanted to take advantage of the Baker family's wealth.
 

Now I finally understood the problem with Betty's perspective. When my parents first got together. Dad didn't have money either. He gradually succeeded in business only with Mom Annie's support. But after Dad's success,Betty seemed to forget they had once struggled too, and began looking down on Mom and Grandma, even though Grandma Ruth had never taken any money from our family.

I suddenly realized that those who talk the most aren't necessarily the ones who truly care about me. And those who truly love me don't always express it with words.

After dinner, I saw Grandma trying to clear the table, but Mitchell immediately stood up: "Please let me handle this. You've been busyall day.


"You're so thoughtful," Grandma said, "but haven't you been working all day too?"

Mitchell smiled and replied: "Driving isn't work for me; it's more like pleasure. Besides, Ms. Taylor prepared such a delicious dinner; I should at least be responsible for cleaning up."
"Then I'll help," Ms. Taylor offered, beginning to collect the plates.

"I want to help too!" I jumped up, helping to clear my own place,folding my napkin neatly as Mom had taught me and placing it aside.
Grandma seemed a bit overwhelmed, but she smiled as she let us work.I overheard her quietly say to Mitchell: "With all of you here, I feel like I've become the guest."
"Ruth, you're already working hard taking care of Brian," Mitchell gently replied. "Letting us share in the household chores is only right."
 

I heard Grandma say: "I'm thinking of looking at those new dishwashers tomorrow, so we can lighten the kitchen work."

When the kitchen was nearly tidied up. I picked up my small backpack: "Grandma. I'm going to my room to study now."

Grandma's eyes widened: "How old are you? Studying already?"

I guessed most kids my age would probably be playing. Grandma asked with concern: "Why put so much pressure on yourself?"

I smiled and explained: "Because I want to stay ahead of the other kids.Think about it-if I finish previewing all the elementary school material now, I'll have much less academic pressure during elementary school..."

These were ideas Ms. Taylor had taught me, and I found them very sensible. I continued explaining: "I can study in advance, so when other children are still struggling with the basics, I'll have already mastered more advanced content. By the time I reach middle and high school, I'll be able to handle things easily and have more time to do what I enjoy."
After hearing my explanation, Grandma smiled and nodded: "Our Brian has really grown up."

I waved goodbye to Grandma and headed to my bedroom.

Walking into my room, I turned on the light. The entire wall was covered with posters of Mom Annie-all specially printed with Mitchell's help. My mood instantly improved.
Ms. Taylor followed me in and sat at my desk: "Let's start on your homework."
"Okay," I put down my backpack, turned on the smalldesk lamp,and
Cnapter 155.1 want to Be with Mom

softly called out: "Mom, Mom."

"I'm here," the small robot placed on the desk responded in Mom's voice-gentle,quiet, and full of love.

Hearing Mom's voice, I suddenly felt a tightness in my throat. This robot was custom-made with Mitchell's help, using recordings from voice messages Mom had sent me before.

The engineer who made it once told me: "Your mom loves you very much;you can hear it in these recordings."

Indeed, only after losing Mom and repeatedly listening to these recordings did I truly understand the love contained in her words. She always cared about everything in my life-wanting me to eat well, dress warmly,stay healthy. Back then, I found her nagging annoying; now I missed it terribly.
I smiled at the robot and said: "I'm going to start my homework now."

"Wow," the robot responded in an admiring tone, just as Mom would say:"Our Brian is so amazing."

I proudly straightened my shoulders: "Of course!"

I placed the robot in front of me so I could feel like Mom was always with me,watching me study.

Looking down to begin my homework, I harbored a small dream in my heart: to study hard, hoping that someday I could invent a time machine.Then I could go back to the past, back to the day when Dad first introduced me to Sarah.
This time, I would stand by Mom's side without hesitation,letting her know she wasn't alone. I would firmly tell Dad: "I want to be with Mom."
 

That way. Mom wouldn't have felt so lonely and helpless when she left.
 

###Chapter 136: Did You See Him?

Annie's POV

When morning light streamed through the curtains, I slowly opened my eyes, memories of last night's intimacy with Howard-starting on the balcony and continuing in this very bedroom-bringing a warm flush to my cheeks. I carefully slipped out of bed, trying not to disturb Howard who was still peacefully asleep beside me.

After getting ready. I went to Lucy's room and found her already awake,focused on her morning reading. Seeing me, she quickly set her book aside and began circling around me with unusual curiosity.

"What are you doing?" I asked, amused by her peculiar behavior.

Lucy tilted her head, her golden hair catching the morning light as she examined me with wonder. "Mom, you look different today!" she declared.
"Different how?" I asked, quickly checking my hair, worried I'd missed something in my morning routine.
"You were sad these past few days, but today you look like you've figured everything out. Your smile is pretty," Lucy said thoughtfuly.
I ruffled her blonde hair. "You're very observant, my little angel."

"Did I guess right?" Lucy asked, her eyes sparkling with excitement.

"Yes," I nodded in confirmation."I was worrying unnecessarily about certain people. But now I realize he belongs in the past. I should forget about him. Even if he appears in front of me every day, I shouldn't let him affect my mood." As I spoke, Philip's face flashed briefly through my mind, but I quickly banished the thought.
 

Lucy's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "MAom,you have such a good temper!"

I basked in her compliment, smiling. "I just don't see the point in adding unnecessary stress to our lives. Especially when we're so happy as we are."

Lucy launched herself into my arms with enthusiasm. "Mom, you're awesome! I didn't want to bother you the past few days because you looked troubled. Now I can spend time with you again!"

I couldn't resist affectionately pinching her soft cheek. "I would love nothing more,sweetheart."

Lucy handed me a hair ribbon. "Mom, can you braid my hair in that pretty style?"

"Of course," I agreed. I had learned many hairstyling techniques online,always hoping to style a daughter's hair someday. With Philip, I only had Brian, so these skills went unused. Now with Lucy, I finally had the opportunity.
When I finished the braid, Lucy looked in the mirror and gasped in delight. "Who is this cute little girl? She's so pretty!"
Her self-compliment brightened my mood even further. "I think she might be a member of our family."
Lucy turned to me and said in a grown-up tone that still carried childlike innocence, "Then you're very lucky!"
The adorable contrast between her mature phrasing and childish delivery made her all the more endearing.
I couldn't help but pinch her cheek again. "Yes, everyone must be jealous that I have such an amazing daughter,"
 

Lucy nodded solemnly. "Other kids must be jealous that I have such a good mom too. Mom. I love you."

I hugged her tightly. "I love you too,darling."

After breakfast, we prepared to take Lucy to school. Howard decided to join us today. In the car. Lucy snuggled against me and whispered,"Mom,I've been really happy lately."

My arm wrapped protectively around her slender waist. "Why do you say that?"

"My classmates noticed I'm talking now, and they're all curious to chat with me," Lucy explained. She paused, seeming to search for the right words. "There was this one classmate who was worried that once the novelty wears off, the other kids might stop paying attention to me. She came up to me and said the other children's interest is just temporary,and once this phase passes, they'll go back to playing with each other."
Lucy continued, her tone surprisingly light, "I asked her, 'So what?' She told me not to cry when that happens. I said, 'So you're worried I'll be sad?That's so thoughtful of you!' Then I thanked her, and she ran away blushing."

I glanced quèstioningly at Howard, our eyes meeting in mutual understanding. As adults, we both recognized the hostility behind that child's words,yet Lucy had innocently misinterpreted it as concern. Ifelt torn-telling Lucy the truth might hurt her, but not telling her could leave her vulnerable to future pain.
Howard gave a slight shake of his head, and I understood his meaning.Perhaps Lucy's carefree attitude was actually her best shield, naturally deflecting negativity.

Lucy noticed our silent exchange. "Mom, Dad, why are you both so serious? What are you thinking about?"

I smiled and pinched her cheek gently. "I just think you handled that very well. When I was little. I always ran to adults to solve my problems. But our Lucy already knows how to handle things herself."

Lucy smiled proudly, showing her neat little teeth.

Still feeling I should offer some guidance, I continued, "But Lucy,remember... if others don't bother us, we shouldn't bother or bully them.But if someone bullies us, we must find ways to protect ourselves.Understand?"

Lucy nodded seriously. "Yes, Mom. But ever since Max left our class, all the other kids have been nice to me."

I sighed with relief and smiled. "I know. I just happened to think about it and wanted to remind you. I want our Lucy to be happy every day and not be affected by other people's negativity."
Lucy responded earnestly, "I'll remember that. Don't worry, Mom, I won't let anyone bully me!"
I offered one more piece of advice, "Whenever you encounter problems you can't solve yourself, don't try to tough it out alone. Be sure to tell us,and we'll help you solve those problems,okay?"
Lucy looked at me, her eyes full of trust and love. "Okay, Mom."

Her response reminded me of Brian. When I hadn't yet given up on him,whenever he faced difficulties, I would patiently offer advice, but he would always impatiently reply, "YouI've said the same thing a hundred times, do you have to keep repeating it?" Initially, I thought he was just being

childish, but as his complaints continued, I realized he genuinely disliked my concern. so I learned to remain silent.

Now, faced with Lucy's extraordinary tolerance, I found myself able to express freely without fear of rejection.

Suddenly. I worried that perhaps Lucy was just being polite and might privately find me annoying too.

Before I could ask, Lucy seemed to read my thoughts. "Mom, kids in my class often complain their moms talk too much and nag... but when you tell me these things. I don't mind. I can hear the love in your words. It makes me happy knowing someone cares about me and loves me properly.


Lucy sat up to hug me. "They don't know how lucky they are."

I felt a warm current flowing from my heart as I responded, "I was just worried I might be talking too much and you wouldn't like it."
Lucy shook her head firmly. "I like it very much."

I hugged her tight. People oftena say Lucy has improved because of my patient companionship, but what they don't realize is that I'm also healing from the trauma of Brian's rejection through Lucy.
Gently nuzzling Lucy's cheek, I whispered, "I'm lucky to have such a wonderful daughter."

"Me too," Lucy answered proudly.′′y mom is the best mom in the whole world!"

Howard let out a small cough beside us, asking in his cool voice with obvious feigned jealousy, "Oh, so before you met your mom,did Dad not

love you?”

Lucy buried her face in my embrace and said softly, "You loved me,but Dad didn't like talking to me." She peeked at Howard with one eye. "And I'm just a little kid. I didn't know how to talk to Dad."

Howard raised an eyebrow, his tone humorous. "What about now?"

Lucy answered without hesitation, "Dad loves me too. My dad is the best dad in the whole world!"

At the Upper East Side Private Preschool, Lucy spotted Penny waiting at the entrance. She quickly opened the door, calling out, "Penny!"

The two girls joined hands and walked toward their classroom, chatting excitedly. I watched with joy, hoping this friendship-Lucy's first since she'd started speaking again-would last.

Then I saw him-Philip standing near the entrance, watching the children.My expression darkened instantly.
Howard, sitting beside me, noticed my sudden change in mood. "Did you see him?" he asked softly.

"Yes," I answered calmly, working to control the anger in my voice. "Didn't he already abandon Brian? Why is he still coming to the preschool?"
I reminded myself that he no longer deserved any emotional investment from me.
 
###Chapter 137:I Will Remember That

Howard's POV

I sat in the car with Annie, watching Lucy and Penny walking hand in hand toward their classroom, chatting excitedly. Their friendship had blossomed remarkably quickly, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction seeing Lucy so animated and engaged.

As I observed the school entrance. I noticed Philip Baker standing not far from the main doors, his gaze constantly scanning the area. He was clearly searching for someone, his posture tense and expectant.

Annie's expression suddenly darkened, the change so immediate I could almost feel the temperature drop between us. Her jaw tightened and her eyes narrowed slightly-subtle changes that most would miss,but I had grown attuned to her every expression.
"Did you see him?" I asked quietly, knowing exactly what had triggered her reaction.
"Yes," Annie replied with unnatural calm, though I could detect the underlying anger in her voice. "Didn't he already abandon Brian? Why is he still coming to the preschool?"
I looked in Philip's direction, assessing the situation before offering Annie reassurance. "You don't need to be so pessimistic about this."
Annie turned to me with a confused look. "What do you mean?"

Rather than answering directly, I gestured for Annie to observe more carefully what was unfolding before us.
Annie redirected her attention to the scene playing out in front of the
 

school. A black sedan pulled up to the curb, and Brian stepped out. When he spotted Philip standing nearby, the boy didn't breakstride-he simply looked straight ahead, deliberately avoiding any eye contact with his father.

Philip noticed his son immediately. He moved forward half a step, his mouth opening as if to speak, but ultimately remained rooted to the spot,his arm awkwardly rising then falling back to his side.

Fatherand son passed each other without exchanging a single word.Brian walked directly toward the school entrance without looking back once.

I smiled with satisfaction. "It seems Philip's recent behavior has truly wounded his son's heart."

"And his son appears to have quite a stubborn temperament-it looks like he has no intention of reconciling with Philip," I added with a hint of approval in my voice.

I reached over to take Annie's hand, giving it a gentle squeeze. "Philip has placed all his hopes on Sarah's child..."
Annie completed my thought with evident satisfaction: "And the child in Sarah's belly isn't even his."

Our eyes met in silent understanding, a shared knowledge that gave us both a certain advantage in this complex situation.
Annie's lips curved upward into an involuntary smile.

The driver,sensing our readiness to depart, started the engine and pualled away from the curb.
Through the rearview mirror, I could see Philip standing alone at the preschool entrance, watching other parents arrive with their children. He
 

looked awkward and isolated, a man clearly out of his element.

Upon reaching Howard Technologies headquarters, Annie and I walked together into our shared office space. I settled into my chair,contemplating the morning's events while Annie organized her files on the other side of the office.

Soon after, my secretary Susan Moore knocked and entered,barely containing her excitement.

"Mr. Thompson, I have good news to report," Susan announced,her face alight with anticipation.

I looked up at Susan. "What is it?"

Susan replied, "Remember several days ago when we completely terminated our partnership with Mr. White's company?"
I nodded. "Yes."

Susan handed me a folder. "I contacted potential new partners, and they immediately invited me to tour their factory and view their latest products.




I took the folder and opened it. "Have you tested their new products? How do they compare to what Mr. White's company was providing?"
Susan was effusive about the new products: "They're far superior to Mr.White's company's offerings, Mr. Thompson. These products are at least 30% more energy-efficient, and the material quality is much more stable."
After reviewing the materials, I closed the folder. "I'm just thinking...perhaps in our future partnerships with other companies, we should
 

include innovation requirements in the contracts? That way, if our partners fail to upgrade their products while other companies make significant advances, we would have the right to terminate the contract and partner with more innovative companies."

Susan nodded in agreement. "Mr. White's company serves as a perfect cautionary tale. They initially sacrificed their most important projects to defeat competitors, transferring control to external investors. As a result.they now cannot generate substantial revenule and have damaged their partnership with our company."

"This way, if our partners fail to upgrade their products while other companies make significant advances..." I continued thoughtfully,"we would have the right to terminate the contract and partner with more innovative companies."

I realized that many companies grew complacent after establishing partnerships with Howard Technologies, believing they no longer needed to improve their products. Meanwhile, other companies fighting for survival continuously enhanced their offerings.
This disparity might be manageable once or twice, but over time, I worried it could eventually drag down Howard Technologies, making us obsolete as well.

For the company's long-term prospects, I felt stricter standards needed to be implemented.
Susan nodded in agreement. "I think that's a brilliant idea."

"Mr. White's company is a perfect cautionary tale," Susan added. "They initially sacrificed their most important projects to defeat competitors,transferring control to external investors."
 

"As a result, they now cannot generate substantial revenue," Susan continued. "They've also damaged their partnership with our company through their actions."

"Yet they confidently claimed they could easily find better partners without us..."Susan shook her head, "I imagine they must be quite disappointed now."

Susan demonstrated her comprehensive understanding of Mr. White's company's situation: "Their technology is far behind, and they've lost Howard Technologies' support."

"From their perspective, this will be an extremely difficult period," she concluded.

I didn't disagree, merely observing: "This illustrates why in fierce competition, one must constantly enhance their competitive advantage. It's also a lesson our company should learn from."
"Yes, sir," Susan replied. "I will remember that."

Susan then shifted topics: "Since learning how much revenue overseas merchandise generates annually, I've been studying their business model. I've discovered their product range is much more diversified than ours,including many everyday household items."

"My plan is to send company personnel abroad to study these methods.and when they return, we can expand our merchandise range to include more practical everyday items. This will increase our sales volume and profitability. What do you think?"
I glanced at Annie working at her desk: "That's a brilliant idea, but I'm not the primary decision-maker in this case," I turned to Annie and asked,

"What do you think?"
 
###Chapter 138:New Talent

Annie's POV

Howard's secretary Susan had just proposed an idea that seemed to catch Howard somewhat by surprise, though I could see he also appreciated her initiative. He turned toward her with a thoughtful expression before remarking. "That's an excellent idea, but I'm not the primary decision-maker here."

He then shifted his gaze to me, his gray eyes seeking my opinion. "What do you think?"

I responded without hesitation, a small smile playing on my lips. "You're both clearly trying to help me earn more money."
Since I began working with Howard, my income had certainly risen dramatically. Though I still felt a jolt of surprise every time I saw my paycheck, I wasn't about to complain. After all, who would object to financial security?

"I fully support the idea, of course," I added, giving a slight nod of approval.
Susan immediately understood the implications of my response-if I had no objections,Howard wouldn't either. With remarkable efficiency, she pulled out her phone and began messaging someone.
Within minutes, a young woman appeared at our door. She had striking red hair that fell loosely around her shoulders, framing her pale skin and slightly nervous expression. Her features weren't particularly refined, but they combined harmoniously to create a fresh, natural appearance.She wore a simple white blouse with a navy knee-length skirt-modest but
 

neat. Her flat shoes showed signs of wear but had clearly been polished with care.

When her eyes met mine, she noticeably faltered. She lowered her head briefly before catching herself and looking back up at me, her gaze filled with confusion.

Her reaction was peculiar, as though she recognized me from somewhere.I decided to address it directly. "Have we met before?"

The young woman hesitated before answering, "You look somewhat familiar,but I can't quite place where I might have seen you."

She added, "I think I may have heard your voice before as well."

I furrowed my brow, trying to recall if we'd crossed paths previously, but nothing came to mind. "Perhaps we encountered each other somewhere in passing. I don't recall either."
"That must be it," she agreed, seeming relieved by the explanation.

Once our exchange concluded, Susan finally made the introduction. "This is Amy Bush. She's the person I'm planning to send abroad for trainng."
"Just her alone?" I asked, concern evident in my voice.

Howard slowed his speech,clearly sharing my worry. "International safety.hasn't been great lately. Sending a young woman by herself-isn't that rather risky?"
Amy, hearing our conversation and perhaps fearing she might lose this opportunity, quickly spoke up. "Though I'm young and haven't experienced mnuch of the world yet, I promise you..." She paused, then continued with greater conviction, "If you're willing to entrust me with this
 

assignment. I'll complete it successfully! I'm fully capable of handling this responsibility!"

As she spoke, her red hair caught the sunlight, shimmering slightly.Her eyes revealed a determination that contrasted sharply with her seemingly delicate appearance.

Howard turned to Susan, silently requesting further explanation.

Susan responded calmly, "We've already arranged security personnel abroad to assist her. They've guaranteed they'll ensure her safe return. You can be completely assured on that front."

I didn't want to stand in her way; she deserved to shape her own destiny.Nevertheless, I felt compelled to offer some advice: "When you're abroad,prioritize your safety above all else. Whatever happens, your wellbeing must come first."

Howard added pragmatically, "If there are any financial losses, inform Susan, and she'll arrange for reimbursement."
"Understood," Amy replied, visibly relieved by our decision. Her shoulders relaxed slightly, and a subtle smile appeared on her face.
After we finished our instructions, Amy left the office of her own accord.Her steps were light yet purposeful, reflecting her inner excitement and resolve.

Once the door closed behind Amy, Susan explained her situation to us:"Her willingness to accept this position stems primarily from financial need.I've heard her mother is seriously ill, requiring substantial medical expenses..."
Susan continued, "Her family's solution was to have her marry and use the
 

bride price to fund her mother's treatment. She wants her mother to recover, but she doesn't want to sacrifice herself through marriage.Somehow she learned our company needed employees for overseas training with substantial allowances, so she volunteered immediately."

Susan explained that she hadn't had an opportunity to share this information earlier, and discussing such personal matters in Amy's presence would have been inappropriate.

She elaborated, "Regarding the allowance, the company already advanced it to her. She used it to cover her mother's hospital admission fees, telling her family it was a bride price from her boyfriend, who requested she move directly into his home. She wwanted to test her family's reaction, but they simply told her to go ahead and not upset her boyfriend.Seeing how they failed to consider her situation or show any concern for her wellbeing,she became completely disillusioned with them. After gathering her belongings from home, she urged us to arrange her overseas assignment as quickly as possible."

Her words struck a chord within me. Though my situation wasn't identical to Amy's, I understood all too well what it felt like to be treated as an exchangeable asset by family. I'd experienced similar treatment when my marriage to Philip was ending-his mother Betty had regarded me as merely an accessory to their family.
Howard remained silent, and I found myself at a loss for words,feeling only a profound sadness for Amy's situation.
After considerable thought, Howard finally spoke:"When she returns.if her performance meets expectations, provide her with an additional bonus."For Howard,financial independence was the surest path to personal dignity and freedom.
 

Susan smiled, "I'll let her know."

"Good," Howard replied concisely.

As the office door closed, I couldn't help but reflect: "Today's young people are becoming increasingly self-reliant. Despite having no job experience, she's determined to solve her family's medical crisis through her own efforts. And even though she's never traveled abroad, she's willing to go alone."

I thought about my own experience-the farthest I'd ever traveled was from Boston to New York. I remembered how nervous I'd been boarding that train, simultaneously excited and terrified. I had followed Philip to New York for love, while Amy was pursuing survival and freedom.Sometimes, the courage to survive requires greater strength than the courage to love.

Howard took my hand with practiced ease. "Indeed. It seems she's genuinely motivated by financial need."
"What makes you say that?" I asked, curious.

"If she were simply drawn to that country..." Howard explained, "she would have wanted to go when safety conditions were better. Given the current unrest ànd instability... yet she still wants to go-it must be purely for the job."

Howard had observed Amny carefully, noting her modest attire, the curiosity in her eyes when looking at him, and her ambition untainted by ulterior motives. This was precisely the type of employee Howard most valued.
"She's certainly driven," I remarked with mixed admiration and concern."

Being so career-focused at such a young age gives her a measure of secuirity for her future. That's commendable. I admire women with professional ambition."

Howard's thumb gently caressed the back of my hand. "She's also quite intelligent-receiving the money without revealing to her family that she earned it herself."

I listened quietly as Howard continued his assessment.

"And her family's attitude doesn't suggest they value her particularly highly," he observed. "She provided them with financiaI support without revealing her promising new position... she's compassionate, yet careful not to put herself at risk. With proper guidance within the company,she could achieve considerable success."

Howard's appreciation for Amy suggested he intended to mentor her.I was genuinely happy for her prospects: "How far she can go will depend on how much effort you invest in her development."
Howard simply gazed at me, his gray eyes containing some inscrutable emotion, as though there were words left unspoken. His expression made me slightly uneasy, yet simultaneously quickened my heartbeat.
"What is it you want to tell me?" I asked softly.
 

###Chapter 139: I Want to See You Jealous

Annie's POV

"What is it you want to tell me?" I asked softly, noticing that inscrutable emotion in Howard's gray eyes.

The memory of our passion on the balcony last night still sent waves of warmth through my body. The way he had pulled me into his embrace,claiming me beneath the stars and city lights remained vivid in my mind.His strong body pressed against mine, his voice low and intimate as he whispered words of love in the night breeze, until we were both exhausted yet satisfied, retreating to the bedroom to continue our passionate encounter well into the night.

Even now, my inner thighs still carried a pleasant soreness, and Howard's love marks scattered across my collarbone and chest were discreetly hidden beneath my blouse. Whenever our eyes met, I could hear his heavy breathing in my ear from the night before echoing in my mind.
"Aren't you jealous?" Howard suddenly asked, pulling me from my reverie.

I looked at him, confused."Jealous of what?"

Howard set down the document he was holding,his gray eyes looking directly into mine. "If I'm going to properly mentor Amy, I'l1 naturally need to spend more time with her."

I smiled slightly, placing my hand over his. "I trust you, and I trust her as well. Since you've chosen me, I believe you won't suddenly transfer your affections elsewhere."
My fingertips lightly traced the blue veins on the back of his hand, feeling
 

the warmth of his skin. "She doesn't even trust her own family-she only trusts herself. It's unlikely she would believe a man couId change her destiny."

"I also don't think she'll fall in love with you," I added, my tone slightly teasing.

After hearing my answer, Howard seemed unsatisfied. His long fingers gently lifted my chin, forcing me to look directly into his eyes. "But I want to see you jealous." His voice was deep and magnetic, just like when he had whispered in my ear last night.

I felt a current of electricity spreading from where he touched me. His touch was too famniliar, involuntarily making me recall how his hands had explored every inch of my skin last night, sending shivers through my body. I forced myself to focus, playing along: "When I see you interacting with other women...I do feel a bit uncomfortable."

Howard's gaze softened, and he leaned forward, almost kissing my lips."But you're the one I love." His breath brushed against my cheek,making me hold my breath involuntarily.
I looked at him in surprise at such a direct declaration, my heart racing.His behavior in such a public setting as the office made me both nervous and excited.

Howard seemed to notice my distraction and gently played with my hair before withdrawing his hand. "I need to get back to work now."
"Alright," I answered, trying to steady my breathing and heartbeat.

I turned to my own workspace, immersing myself in my comic illustrations.Work had been particularly busy these past few days, and I was

determined to use every minute in the office to advance my picture book project.

Occasionally, I would feel Howard's gaze on me, like a silent caress that made my cheeks flush slightly.

After several hours of focused work. I finally completed my morning tasks.I gently massaged my sore shoulders and decided to rest briefly on the sofa. Shortly after lying down, there was a knock at the door.

Howard, accustomed to interruptions during work, responded calmly:"Come in."

Catherine Morgan pushed open the door and rushed to my side,grabbing my waist with evident agitation. "You can't imagine how ridiculous Bill White is! When he came to the company looking for me last time,I thought it was too much! But who could have guessed he could do something even more outrageous!"
I wrapped my arm around her shoulders,feeling her body tremble with anger."What happened?"
Catherine took a deep breath, forcing herself to calm down. "A few days ago, he called me claiming that my father offended his family while standing up for me. He said his family had withdrawn all their investments, putting my family in a dangerous position, possibly leading to bankruptcy!" Her voice mixed with anger and disbelief. "Then he had the audacity to say that if I agreed to marry him, he would persuade his family to continue investing in my father's business."
Catherine rolled her eyes as she repeated his words. "I immediately berated him over the phone. I asked if he had mental problems. He already has a girlfriend he supposedly loves dearly. Instead of treating her

well and maintaining a normal relationship, why is he approaching me?"

I noticed Howard had set aside his work and was listening attentively to our conversation, a cold gleam flashing in his eyes.

Catherine looked at me intently. "Guess how he responded?"

Unable to comprehend his logic, I simply raised an eyebrow quizzically. 'Hmm?"

"He said that even when he's with his girlfriend, he still can't control thinking about me." Catherine let out a contemptuous laugh. "He claimed he still loves me more. I scolded him for another half hour before finally telling him I'd already seen the news."

She paused, a hint of smugness crossing her face. "The news reported that my father had established a partnership with Howard Technologies.Howard is wealthier than his family and would certainly help my father resolve any financial issues."

I genuinely praised her quick thinking. "You're so clever."

Catherine lifted her chin confidently. "Of course. Then I reminded him to stop thinking about me and suggested he pay more attention to his own company, or it might go bankrupt before he realizes it." She shook her head. "How can people in their circle be so brainless? Their family business is declining, potentially leaving the entire family unable to maintain their lifestyle, yet he doesn't care at all and only has romance on his mind?"

Howard and I exchanged a glance, and he nodded slightly, evidently agreeing with my thoughts. I tentatively suggested, "Is it possible he believes that no matter what problems he causes, his family will always

solve them for him? Perhaps that's why he's so reckless?"

Catherine nodded in agreement. "Very likely."

I smiled and added. "What he didn't anticipate was that this time,his family is busy saving themselves. And the only project that might turn things around has now been handed to your,family."

Hearing my assessment. Catherine covered her mouth to suppress her laughter. "If I were his family. I'd be regretting it deeply."

"Unfortunately for them, it's too late for regrets now," I replied, a hint of schadenfreude in my voice. Thinking of Bill White, I couldn't help but draw a parallel to Philip-men who believed they could have everything without consequences. But life always proved them wrong.
Just then, Catherine's phone alarm suddenly rang. She hurriedly stood up."I need to get to work now."
"Good luck," I said, standing to see her off before turning to Howard,finding him watching me intently.
After Catherine hastily closed the door, only Howard and I remained in the room. A subtle electric current flowed between us.
I walked back to my position, but Howard's gaze followed my every move.At that moment, I was grateful he couldn't read my thoughts-I was savoring every sweet word he had whispered in my ear last night, and every touch. Comparing Amy's determined independence and Bill's presumption, I recalled Howard's earlier words and suddenly understood.
"Do you really want me to be jealous?" I asked softly without looking up.

Howard was silent for a moment, then the tip of his pen stopped on the

paper as he looked up. "I want to know how important I am to you."

My heart skipped a beat as I finally understood his intention. This outwardly calm and self-disciplined man also had a vulnerable side that yearned to be loved and needed.

A smile appeared on my face as I picked up my pencil and continued my illustration work. "Rest assured, you're even more important to me than you imagine."
 
###Chapter 140: Actions Have Consequences

Howard's POV

I sat at my desk, deeply focused on reviewing the quarterly financial projections when Susan approached with several file folders tucked under her arm. Her usual efficient demeanor was complemented by a slight smile that told me she had information she was eager to share.

"Mr. Thompson," Susan began as she placed the market intelligence report on my desk, "according to our sources, since terminating our partnership with White's company, eighteen different corporations have approached them, but all have declined to establish any working relationship."

I looked up from my computer screen, giving Susan my ful attention."Reason?" I asked concisely.

"Outdated technology, products failing to meet contemporary market demands," Susan answered directly, her tone matter-of-fact. "Bill White and his father evidently haven't realized their technology has fallen behind industry standards. For years, it was our company's orders sustaining them, not the other way around."
I tapped my fingers lightly against the polished surface of my desk,considering the implications. The White family had operated under the delusion that they were the benefactors in our partnership, when in reality,we had been propping up their increasingly obsolete business model.
"The White family believedthey were the benefactors in our partnership,"I observed. "They neglected the importance of research and development.What's their current financial situation?"
Susan flipped through several pages in her folder before responding.”
 

Quite dire. They recently invested substantial capital into a joint venture with the Morgan family, attempting to undermine Morgan's company.Now they desperately need funds to upgrade their technology, but they've exhausted their available resources."

I felt a twinge of sympathy for Bill's father. The older man had spent decades building his company, only to see it decline because he followed his son's misguided advice. Now they were facing the consequences of targeting Catherine's family business-a move that had backfired spectacularly.

"Keep monitoring the situation," I instructed Susan. "I anticipate they'll contact us soon."

Susan nodded and exited my office with her characteristic efficiency.As the door closed behind her, I returned my attention to the financial projections, but my mind kept drifting to the White family's predicament.Their situation perfectly illustrated a principle I had observed repeatedly in business: arrogance inevitably precedes a fall. Bill White had believed his family's company was indispensable, and that hubris had led directly to their current troubles.

Less than thirty minutes after Susan left, my prediction materialized. My phone rang, and the screen displayed Mr. White Senior's name.
I answered, maintaining my professionaI demeanor. "Thompson speaking."

"Mr. Thompson," the voice on the other end attempted a casual tone that failed to mask his desperation. "I've been thinking about our companies'relationship over the years. We've built quite a substantial partnership...This sudden termination of our collaboraton has left me feeling somewhat.., unsettled. Perhaps you might reconsider giving us another chance to continue working together?"

I kept my voice calm and professional. "I don't believe this has anything to do with our relationship, Mr. White. It seems more like you attempted to findother partners, and only after being rejected did you remember your long-term collaborator-me."

His voice became more pleading. "Would you still be willing to give me another chance, Mr. Thompson?"

"We signed a contract with a new company yesterday," I informed him,my tone neutral but final.

Through the phone, I could sense Mr. White's defeat settling in. "Then it would be wrong to cancel your arrangement with them for our sake."

"Correct." I replied simply.

"Ill consider other solutions, then," Mr. White said awkwardly before ending the call.
After hanging up, I contemplated the situation for a moment,then decided to contact Mr. Morgan. As Catherine's father, he had been the target of Bill White's scheme, and I wanted to ensure he handled the aftermath appropriately.

I dialed his number, and he answered almost immediately.

"Mr. Thompson?" He sounded surprised to hear from me.

"Are you aware of the White family's current situation?" I asked directly.

"Yes," Mr. Morgan replied. "We discussed this issue previously-you suggested I should return the money he invested in our project, correct?"
"That's right," I confirmed.
 

"What would happen if I don't return his money?" Mr. Morgan asked cautiously, a hint of satisfaction in his voice.

I leaned back in my chair, choosing my words carefully. "The White family would lose some money, but they wouldn't go bankrupt. After a period of recovery, they would inevitably bounce back. For me. the impact would be negligible. Even if relations between us deteriorated, Mr. White would still need to work with me to generate revenue, given our company's scale. But your situation is different."

I continued my explanation, wanting him to fully understand the potential consequences. "Your company is relatively small. Once the White family recovers. they will certainly direct their resentment toward you,launching a large-scale attack against your company. Have you considered how to address this possibility?"

"No." Mr. Morgan admitted honestly.

"In your opinion, could my company withstand that kind of pressure if the situation escalates to that point?" he asked, seeking my assessment.
"The probability is very low," I replied candidly. "Therefore, your best solution is to proactively contact Mr. White. Tell him you're willing to return all the funds heinvested in your company. Help him resolve his current crisis, even though he previously explicitly stated that repayment wasn't necessary,"
Silence filled the line for a moment as Mr. Morgan considered my advice.

"If he's reasonable, he won't trouble you afterward," I continued. "But if he remains unreasonable and persists in targeting you, you can contact me anytime.I'll help."
 

Hearing my assurance, Mr. Morgan noticeably relaxed. "Alright, I'll follow your suggestion immediately!"

"Good," I responded briefly, concluding the call.

After ending the conversation, I returned to my work, but my thoughts lingered on the situation. Bill White and his father's poor decisions had led to serious consequences-they had not only lost their partnership with our company but were also facing the dual challenges of technological obsolescence and financial shortages.

Meanwhile, Mr. Morgan needed to learn to remain rational in business competitions and not let short-term victories cloud his judgment.

In the business world, every decision creates a chain reaction. Whetherit's the White family's arrogance or Mr. Morgan's satisfaction,everyone must take responsibility for their actions. I believed this experience would provide valuable lessons for all parties involved-especially young Catherine, who would eventually take over her family business.
 
###Chapter 141: Standing on the Same Side

Philip's POV

I stood by the office window. my thoughts completely consumed by Annie.During my recent visits to Howard Technologies, I'd noticed a subtle hint of worry in her eyes. But today, that concern had vanished entirely,replaced by a lightness and joy I hadn't seen in ages.

I yanked at my tie, trying to ease the suffocating sensation. Just as I drew a deep breath, my phone rang. The caller ID showed Allen Stark, my longtime friend from Wall Street who was now helping me discreetly investigate Howard Thompson.

"Any progress?" I snatched up the phone and strode toward the leather couch at the other end of my office, dropping heavily onto it.
"I still need more time, Philip," Allen's voice sounded somewhat exhausted.
"Thompson is a well-known figure in New York, and his personal information is extremely secure. Even with my connections in financial circles, digging into his past romantic history isn't easy."
My knuckles turned white from gripping the phone too tightly. "Didn't you say you'd already confirmed he has a relationship he can't let go of?"I struggled to control the impatience in my voice.
"It's mostly confirmed, but we still need clearer details." Allen paused. "A friend of mine in the Ivy League alumni association mentioned that Thompson was indeed in love with a woman during his college years,but she disappeared later. We need more evidence to confirm the nature and current status of this relationship."
"Disappeared? What does that mean?" I sat up straight.
 

"Disappeared in the literal sense. She might have gone abroad, or perhaps changed her identity. Give me a few days, and I'll find more information."

"Alright," I abruptly stood up and walked to the office liquor cabinet,unscrewing a bottle of whiskey with one hand. "But make it quick. This is important to me."

After hanging up. I poured half a glass of whiskey and downed it in one gulp. The burning sensation in my throat made me slightly more clearheaded. I slammed the glass back onto the desk, then leaned against the window frame and closed my eyes.

I couldn't understand how Annie's feelings for me had detached so rapidly.I pinched the bridge of my nose, trying to organize my thoughts:
*"Why? She once loved me so much. How could she reach a point where her happiness and sorrows have nothing to do with me in just a few short months?"*

*"Was our six-year marriage really just a torment for her?"*

I pounded my fist against the window frame, forcing myself to face facts I'd been avoiding:
When I spoke to her, my tone was always condescending and arrogant.

Whenever my mother Betty tried to impose "rules" on Annie, I never stood up to defend her.
Since Sarah's return, I'd carefully concealed every interaction between us from Annie.
Whenever Sarah and Annie had any conflict, I almost instinctively assumed Annie was at fault.
 

These realizations hit me like a punch to the stomach. My attitude toward Annie had been far worse than I was willing to admit. I poured another glass of whiskey, my fingers unconsciously tapping on the rim.

I reluctantly recognized why Annie would be attracted to Howard:

When others challenged her. Howard was always the first to stand up and support her.

That typically cold and distant tech CEO showed endless patience and tenderness toward Annie.

He truly valued her-in stark contrast to my former indifference.

If Howard had always been this good to Annie, perhaps I should gracefully bow out. I drained my glass in one gulp, the alcohol making my thoughts even clearer. No, impossible. Allen's preliminary investigation gave me hope: Howard also had a relationship he couldn't let go. He was likely just using Annie as a temporary substitute.
I dropped heavily back into my chair behind the desk, staring glumly at the computer screen, contemplating my next move. When Howard eventually leaves Annie for his true love, she'll face a second betrayal. The pain then will be deeper than what I caused her. She might never believe in love again. I'can't let that happen.

My phone rang again. I checked the time-only 9 AM. Sarah Johnson's name appeared on the screen. Calling this early? I frowned, hesitating for a second before answering.
"What is it?" I didn't hide the coldness in my voice.

There was silence on the other end for a few seconds. "Last time, didn't you promise to fund the promotion of my comics?" Sarah asked cautiously.
 

Calling first thing in the morning for money? I felt a surge of irritation but quickly suppressed it. Supporting Sarah's work was part of my plan-when Annie saw how generous I was being toward Sarah,she couldn't help but compare me to Howard. I wanted her to see that even after our divorce. I was still the man who could fulfill others' dreams.

"T'll have the finance department arrange the transfer immediately,"I answered decisively, my fingers tapping rhythmically on the desk.

Sarah noticeably relaxed: "That's great. I'll contact the marketing team as soon as I receive the funds." After a brief pause, she added: "By the way,do you know any companies that make merchandise products?"
"Not at the moment," I said, cradlng the phone between my ear and shoulder while flipping open my calendar to check today's meeting schedule.

"Tve never been involved in this industry before 'and don't know who to approach for merchandise production. This might be somewhat tricky,"she explaïned, her voice carrying an expectant tone, clearly hoping I would solve everything.
"Leave these matters to me," I closed the calendar,responding somewhat absentmindedly. Although I wanted to showcase my support for Sarah in front of Annie, I also hoped Sarah would share some of the workload.considering how busy I was.	
"Okay, I'll also look around for contacts," Sarah said, her voice already much more relaxed. "If I can find suitable companies, I'll communicate with them directly."
"Good," I answered, relieved that I wouldn't need to personally handle everything.
 

"Honestly,without you. I wouldn't know what to do," Sarah said gratefully."Promotion requires money, everything requires money.Without funding,I can't do anything."

I chuckled lightly: "Sarah, we're on the same side now. No need to be so formal."

"Yes!" she responded eagerly.

After hanging up, I tossed my phone down and abruptly stood up, blood pounding in my temples. A thought suddenly struck me: Sarah was merely interested in my money and status, while Annie had once truly loved me. I clenched my fists, stung by this ironic contrast.

I strode to the window. pressing my forehead against the cold glass.Outside, the world continued its busy routine, while my world was collapsing. When I had Annie, I was blind to her value; after losing her,I finally understood her worth. Now, I needed to prove I deserved her.
I spun around and returned to my desk, picked up the phone,and dialed the internal line to the company's finance department.
"Arrange an immediate transfer to Sarah Johnson," I ordered, my voice low and determined. "Then help me contact the heads of several top merchandise production companies. I need to meet with them this afternoon."

After hanging up, I took a deep breath, my gaze falling on a photograph of Annie and Brian on my desk-a picture from when we were still a family. I gently brushed the frame, feeling an unprecedented determination burning within me.
"Allen will find Howard's weakness, and I will bring you back, Annie," I
 

whispered, like a vow. "Whatever the cost. I'll prove I'm more worthy of your trust and love than he is. Our story isn't over yet."
 
###Chapter 142: I Can Do This

Sarah's POV

I set my phone down after ending the call with Philip Baker. Although we had been discussing serious business matters, I had maintained a light tone throughout our conversation. The moment I hung up, I immediately dialed Caroline Gluck's number,cutting straight to the point.

"Do you know what merchandise Annie's brand offers?" I asked without any preamble.

Caroline seemed pleased to receive my call. "I know the general situation,"she answered promptly. "Everything related to Annie is now fully handled by Susan Moore, and I'm just a regular employee in some department at Howard Technologies, so my knowledge is quite limited."
"Doesn't that mean you're somewhat isolated there?" I asked with a hint of sympathy in my voice.
"Not exactly. Initially, they wanted me to get involved, but I kept telling them that Annie's work wasn't very good, saying it wasn't as good as yours," Caroline explained. "The reason I'm in this position is because of my loyalty to you."
Hearing this I felt a twinge of guilt and suggested, "Would you like to come work for my company then?"
"I'd rather not," Caroline declined immediately. "Your comic company is just starting out and needs funding. If I joined, you'd have to pay me a salary,which wouldn't be cost-effective for you."
I didn't respond to her reasoning, and after a moment, Caroline asked, "By
 

the way, why are you suddenly asking about merchandise?"

I took a deep breath. Being pregnant. handling all this pressure without anyone's help was truly exhausting. Without thinking, I answered."Because I'm planning to produce merchandise too."

"I can help take a look at Annie's display window to see what they're selling, and I can even compile detailed information about materials and such into a document and send it directly to you," Caroline enthusiastically offered.

"You're amazing!" I exclaimed excitedly. "Could you also help me find some merchandise manufacturers? Philip said he would help, but he's Annie's ex-husband, and I don't completely trust himn. I think manufacturers you recommend would be better."
"Tll ask around for you," Caroline agreed readily.

"I'll wait for your good news," I said before hanging up. I leaned back against the sofa, gently caressing my pregnant belly. I suddenly realized the irony of my situation. While other pregnant women were resting quietly at home, I was busier than I had been before pregnancy.
Soon after, my phone rang-it was Caroline. "I've sent al the contact information to your phone," she informed me cheerfully. "Including screenshots of the products in Annie's display window."
Looking at the information on my phone, I couldn't help but smile. The contacts Caroline provided could produce almost everything in Annie's collection. "Thank you. When I start making money, I won't forget your tremendous help."
"Then I'll be waiting for your grand success!" Caroline replied.
 

After ending the call. I began dialing the numbers on the list one by one,discussing potential collaborations. The manufacturers either requested face-to-face meetings or demanded advance payments, concerned that I might be a scammer. Without hesitation, I transferred money directly to them. For those who insisted on meeting in person, I politely declinedand instead offered to pay partial deposits.

Seeing my sincere commitment, the manufacturers agreed to work with me.This filled me with excitement, and I was surprised at how easily things had been resolved-even easier than enchanting men, making them fall in love with me and willing to spend money on me.

I almost regretted my past choices. If I had known working was this simple, why did I look for men after my divorce? Wouldn't it have been better to throw myself completely into a career?
After arranging for merchandise production, I began contacting marketing companies. My previous comic company had a decent marketing department, and rather than risking working with unfamiliar people, I decided to contact those I already knew.

I called my former contact directly: "How's business at our company these days?"
The marketing manager answered with a wry smile in his voice, "Income is declining every day. If we don't find a way to turn things around soon,we might have to close down."
I immediately offered an opportunity: "Would you like to work with me then? I have a comic that needs marketing to increase its influence."
After consideration, the manager quoted an amount. Although it sounded substantial, it was insignificant compared to the money Philip had given
 

me. I was even shocked by how low it was, though I didn't show it.

"Tll pay a portion first, and you can show me what kind of results you get,
" I suggested. "If the datalooks promising. I'll invest in higher-priced promotion."

The mention of money and the prospect of larger contracts immediately motivated the marketing manager. "No problem. When will you transfer the funds?"

Although my pregnancy made me reluctant to go out, I could see the manager's urgent need for funds. "Send me your account information,and I'll go make the transfer now."

Supporting my belly, I slowly got up and walked to the door, then instructed my driver to take me to the bank. Upon arrival, I waited in line,submitted the completed form, and honestly explained the purpose of the transfer.

After receiving the receipt, I immediately notified the manager that the money had been sent, and he quickly replied: "Got it. Wait for my good news."

Returning home, I opened my phone to finid my work being widely promoted online. Many people had checked out my comic out of curiosity and discovered it was actually quite good. More and more people began following my work, and merchandise sales were rapidly increasing.
It seemed the marketing manager was truly capable-the promotion attracted real readers, not just fake fans. My mood improved significantly.If just this small investment could generate such attention, what kind of effect would more investment bring? Would my work become a hot topic on all platforms?
 

Just imagining the entire nation focusing on my work excited me, though I tried to contain my enthusiasm. I felt a headache coming on. I had grown accustomed to relying on men, simply stating my needs and letting them handle things. Now everything depended entirelyon myself.

Despite feeling exhausted, I experienced an indescribable sense of accomplishment. After calculating costs, I realized that even after deducting various expenses, I would make considerable profit-perhaps even more than Annie.

My mood lifted noticeably, and even my physical fatigue seemed to disappear. Lying on the sofa, I took out my phone and sent a,message to Howard: "I'm pretty amazing, aren't I?"
 
###Chapter 143:Proud Messages

Robert's POV

I sat in my apartment, staring at the two phones on the table before me-one my own, the other a secondary line Howard had entrusted me to manage. Howard had asked me to handle his communications with Sarah.and I had agreed, thoughit wasn't exactly easy for me.

I noticed a series of messages Sarah had sent to Howard's secondary number:

"I'm pretty amazing, aren't I?"

"Philip gave me funding and complete control over my work."

"I contacted marketing companies myself, found manufacturers myself,arranged shipping myself."

"I handled everything on my own."

I immediately took screenshots and forwarded them to Howard. His response came quickly: "She's still the same Sarah."
Another message followed: "She never changes, always seeking approval and validation."
I could almost picture Howard's dismissive expression. He added, "Just respond casually, don't let her get too comfortable."
Reading these words, I felt an inexplicable sting in my chest. Sarah, my ex-wife,pregnant yet still having to handle everything herself. I remembered how she looked when she was pregnant with Max-her swollen feet,stretch marks, and frequent bouts of morning sickness. Back then, I could
 

provide her with the best of everything.

Instead of immediately responding through Howard's phone, I picked up my own and sent Sarah a message:

"Sarah,how have you been doing lately?"

After sending it, I waited for a response, but nothing happened.One minute passed, then five, then ten... She hadn't even viewed my message.

I felt a sharp pain in my heart, like being pricked by a needle. I had tried to convince myself that she hadn't replied to my previous messages because pregnancy had made her too tired and she'd fallen asleep. But now, I clearly understood the truth-she simply didn't want to waste time on me.

Just then, Howard's secondary phone received new messages from Sarah:

"What do you think? Don't you think I'm a capable career woman now?"

"Perfectly managing everything even while pregnant."

"Compared to Annie..."

"Who letsothers handle everything for her."

"Tsk tsk."

Again, I forwarded screenshots to Howard, who quickly replied: "She dares to compare herself to Annie? What a joke. Annie works hard and graciously accepts support-that's true intelligence. Sarah is just boasting about doing what she's supposed to do."
Howard's tone was full ofdisdain: "She doesn't understand anything."
 

Reading these messages, I suddenly felt sorry for Sarah. This woman who once only knew how to enjoy the luxurious Upper East Side lifestyle was now pregnant and handling everything alone.

My instinct was to help her, but then I remembered my current situation-my family business had collapsed, and I had almost nothing left. What could I possibly do for her?

Taking a deep breath, I forced myself to maintain distance and responded through Howard's phone with a simple:

"Is that so?"

Almost immediately, Sarah replied:

"Yes,exactly."

"I'm a woman too, and I know women in this world are strong, not as fragile as people think."
"You don't need to protect her so much."

I stared at these words, contemplating how to respond. Sarah obviously wanted Howard's approval and was trying to elevate herself in his eyes by belittling Annie. It was typical behavior, but in this moment, I couldn't blame her.

I sent Howard a message: "She's implying Annie is too dependent on you."

Howard replied: "Typical Sarah, always trying to elevateherself by putting others down. Let her talk, continue the conversation."
After a period of silence, I finally responded as Howard:

"But isn't making money so my woman can live well exacty the point?"
 

After sending this message, I put down the phone,remembering the first time I met Sarah at a charity gala. I had fallen for her at first sight,actively pursuing her, willing to do anything to win her love. Although Sarah eventually agreed to be with me, her attitude toward me was always cool, never showing the enthusiasm she now displayed toward Howard.

I couldn't describe how I felt now, only that years of effort seemed completely wasted. The realization made me feel suffocated.

Howard's secondary phone chimed again. Sarah had replied: "But I'm more capable than she is. If you were with me, you'd have fewer problems.



I forwarded this message to Howard, who immediately responded: "She really thinks she's that charming, doesn't she? Tell her I don't like being a third party."

Looking at these instructions, I finally responded to Sarah: "But I don't like third parties."

Almost instantly, I regretted my response. I couldn't understand why the love I desperately fought for was never reciprocated, while Howard, who had no interest in Sarah, effortlessly attracted her admiration.

Sarah quickly replied: "I'm not a third party. I'm just brave enough to pursue love."
I forwarded this response to Howard, who briefly answered: "Don't reply to her anymore."
But Sarah wasn't about to stop. A few minutes later,two more messages arrived:
"Do you really like Annie that much?"

"I don't see what's so special about her."

Following Howard's instructions, I put the phone down, deciding not to respond further. This conversation had gone far enough. I couldn't continue this charade, couldn't risk further antagonizing Sarah and increasing her hostility toward Annie. After all, our son Max was with Sarah, and I couldn't afford tolose contact with him.

I could only think about how I once had everything this city could offer-wealth, status, family. Now. I had almost nothing. All I could do was try to protect those I still cared about, even if they might no longer care about me.


My gaze drifted to the window, where the New York skyline stretched across the horizon. The same buildings I once viewed from my penthouse office now loomed like distant monuments to a life I no longer had. The setting sun cast long shadows across my sparsely furnished apartment-a painful reminder of how far I had fallen.

I remembered the days when Sarah would greet me at the door of our Upper East Side mansion, Max running behind her. Those memories now felt like they belonged to someone else entirely. The weight of my failures pressed down on me, making it difficult to breathe.
The phone on the table-my own-remained silent. No missed calls, no unread messages. The contrast with Howard's secondary phone, constantly lighting up with Sarah's desperate attempts to gain his attention,was stark and painful.

I poured myself a glass of whiskey-not the expensive brand I once favored, but a cheaper alternative that burned just the same going down.The irony wasn't lost on me. Sarah had left me when our family fortune collapsed, and now she was pursuing a man who had everything I once
 

possessed.

The truth was painfully clear: she had never loved me for who I was,only for what I could provide. And yet, knowing this did nothing to ease the ache in my chest. Some part of me still cared about her, still worried about her pregnancy and her well-being.

I picked up Howard's phone one last time, scrolling through Sarah's messages. Her desperation for his approval was evident in every word.I wondered if she had ever sought my approval with such eagerness, if she had ever truly wanted my attention rather than just my money.
 
###Chapter 144:You Must Be Lying

Annie's POV

I was sitting at my workstation in Howard's office. I had been working on a particularly challenging panel for my children's book, trying to capture the perfect expression for my main character: when the office door opened.

Philip Baker walked in with his usual confident stride. I kept my head down, pretending to be absorbed in my work. From the corner of my eye,I noticed Howard's expression-a brief flash of annoyance quickly masked by professional courtesy. After all. Philip was here to discuss a potential business collaboration, not to socialize.

I continued sketching, though I couldn't help but overhear their conversation. To my surprise, Philip remained unusually focused on the business discussion throughout the meeting. There was none of the subtle posturing or personal comments I had come to expect from him. Perhaps he was finally learning to separate business from personal matters.
When they finally reached an agreement, Howard stood up, clearly intending to escort Philip out. However, instead of heading directly to the door, Philip changed course and walked toward my workspace. I kept my pencil moving across the paper, feigning complete concentration on my sketch.
"Annie, did I tell you I gave Sarah a huge sum of money to promote her comics?" Philip asked, his tone carrying what I perceived as pride.
I looked up at his proud expression, finding it somewhat amusing but keeping my face neutral. "No, you didn't tell me," I replied honestly.
A thought crossed my mind: someday,Philip would discover that the
 

child Sarah was carrying wasn't actually his. I imagined sending Brian a recording of this conversation, letting him know how his father had generously given Sarah a massive amount of money while quibbling over his son's living expenses. I suspected this revelation would significantly impact their father-son relationship.

Concealing my private schadenfreude, I asked casually. "Why do you bring this up?"

"Would Howard spend that much money on you?" Philip probed further.the corner of his mouth turning up in that self-satisfied smile I knew so well.

I glanced at Howard, mentally calculating. It suddenly occurred to me that Howard had invested considerably in my work-purchasing several factories for merchandise production, fully funding my animation project,and arranging for both domestic and international promotion. I roughly estimated that the amount Howard had actually spent even exceeded the figure Philip was boasting about.

Before I could formulate a response, Howard calmly interjected, "You know I always prioritize profit."

Philip's facelit up with satisfaction upon hearing this answer, his eyes brightening like a high school student who had just won a debate. "So you're saying you wouldn't spend that much?"
Howard didn't contradict him, evidently unconcerned about revealing how much he had spent on me.
"Now that you see Sarah earning more than you and gaining more popularity, don't you feel envious or jealous?" Philip turned to me with what I perceived as a smug expression.
 

"No." I answered honestly, "many people earn more than I do. If I were to be jealous of everyone,when would it end?"

Philip stared at me, clearly not believing my response.

"Regardless of what the future holds. I'm already content with my current situation" I continued. "My monthly income now exceeds anything I could have imagined before. Even if I greedily wanted more,what would be the point?"


Philip looked shocked, and I sensed he hadn't expected me to be so easily satisfied.

"But initially, Sarah wasn't as good as you. Then she suddenly became better than you," he hastily argued, his face flushing red, hands gesturing in the air like a student protesting a deduction in points.

"I foresaw this long ago," I responded calmly, understanding that Philip still didn't believe me. But to me, it no longer mattered.
"Even though you always claimed to love me, your heart has actually been with Sarah all along, you just never realized it. When we were still married,you openly favored her. After the divorce, you claimed to love me,coming to pursue me every day, but... your actions told a different story."
I chuckled softly. "For instance, you were always unwilling to spend money on me. Despite having considerable assets, you never wanted to buy me flowers, always saying it was wasteful because flowers would wither within days, suggesting we should have home-cooked meals together instead."

"Was there anything wrong with what I said?" Philip immediately defended himself, chin raised, wearing an expression of someone
 

wrongfully accused.

"Nothing wrong." I nodded in agreement. "But when it came to buying flowers for Sarah, you didn't think that way, did you?"

"That was her fist visit to our home. Wasn't it appropriate for me to welcome her?"Philip still had excuses.

"You're always so stingy! You've held a grudge about buying flowers for someone else for so long," he instinctively accused me, the veins on his forehead faintly visible, his lips pressed into a thin line like an executive whose proposal had been rejected.

I was no longer troubled by his accusations, only hoping he would recognize who he truly loved, hoping afterward he would stop bothering me and return to Sarah. That way, when Sarah's child was born, the information I planned to reveal would deliver a devastating blow to him.
"When was the last time you bought me flowers?" I asked calmly.

Philip struggled to recall.

"Don't bother trying to remember-because you never bought me flowers,not once," I helped him answer.
"You wanted a divorce just because I never bought you flowers?" Philip frowned, his tone still carrying impatience, hands splayed outward, his expression as exaggerated as a poor soap opera actor.
As soon as the words left his mouth, his expression suddenly froze,as if realizing something. We were already separated; I had no need to threaten divorce. He lowered his head, lips pressed tightly together, in what appeared to me as quite an awkward manner.


"Flowers are just one example. You felt that spending even a penny on me was a waste." I reflected, wondering how I had tolerated such treatment.

"But you never complained about buying expensive luxury items and jewelry for Sarah," I continued calmly.

Philip clenched his fists, opened his mouth as if to rebut, but ultimately remained silent. His mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water,eyes wide but unable to produce a sound.

I noticed the small beads of sweat forming on his forehead and his slightly reddening cheeks, which I thought was typically his reaction when feeling cornered.

"They say a man's money follows his heart," I continued steadily. "I think you're still in love with Sarah."

"But wasn't I good to you when we were together?" Philip stared at me intently.

"Before dating Howard, I didn't know what good or bad treatment was.I thought your behavior was normal, and I even feared I might encounter someone worse than you. So I endured all your hurtful actions," I chose my words carefully.

"After officially dating Howard, I realized that when a man loves a woman,he treats her well wholeheartedly. He doesn't use 'typical man' as anexcuse to avoid romantic gifts and dates. He pays attention to all the small details in life."
I looked directly at Philip. "Then I knew for certain that you hadn't been good to me. Every day of those six years was difficult."
Philip's lips moved, but he ultimately remained silent.

"Seeing your attitude toward Sarah. it's clear your feelings for her are genuine. When you saw Sarah being treated unfairly in her work, you undoubtedly felt heartbroken, wishing to bring her back to the peak of success. making everyone admire and worship her," I observed his expression,smiling as I spoke.

"I foresaw this long ago, so when you actually did it, it was completely within my expectations," I added, slowing my pace.

"You claim you're not jealous of her, but you must be lying. You must be jealous of her! Envious of her! Hate her!" Philip emphasized each word,and from the excitement in his tone, I guessed he might be trying to convince himself of something.

"If thinking that makes you feel better... then you can think that way,"I answered, not understanding why he was saying this, but not wanting to delve deeper.

Philip fell silent, just staring at me, his expression like an adult who had just been told Santa Claus doesn't exist-confused and frustrated.
"You two continue talking. I'll step out for a moment," I glanced at Howard beside me, saying calmly.
 
###Chapter 145: Bill White Might Soon Be Parer than Me!
Annie's POV

To be honest. even though I haid adjusted my attitude toward Philip. I still didn't want to spend any more time with him than necessary. Every conversation with him always ended with him saying something utterly confusing.which left me feeling exhausted.

"Hmm," Howard nodded, his perceptive eyes noticing my discomfort.He gestured toward the door. "Go ahead."

When I stepped out of the office, breathing in the slightly fresher air of the hallway. I felt an immediate sense of relief. Philip had transformed into someone who only made unreasonable demands, using what he called"love" to mask his controlling nature and selfishness. I couldn't help questioning myself: how had I ever fallen in love with Philip in the first place? What had blinded me to see past his eloquent promises and carefully crafted tenderness?

Six years of marriage, looking back now, seemed like an elaborately staged play, and somehow I had been completely immersed in the illusion he created. The contrast between his genuine concern for Sarah and his perfunctory attention to me was so stark-I don't know how my former self had been so blind to it all. Perhaps it was the naivety of first love that made me believe every sweet word he uttered, or maybe I wanted a complete family so desperately that I ignored all the obvious warning signs.
Regardless, I was thankful that my life now was filled with genuine care and respect. I no longer needed to guess whether someone's feelings for me were sincere. Suddenly, I spotted Catherine Morgan just stepping out
 

of the elevator. Her eyes immediately brightened when she saw me.

"What are you doing here?" she asked excitedly, her tone filled with pleasant surprise.

"Just getting some fresh air," I replied, somewhat surprisedI to see her here as well. "What about you? Are you here to see Howard?"

Catherine linked her arm through mine, her eyes sparkling with the unmistakable gleam of gossip. "I'm here looking for you, to share some absolutely shocking news!"

"Oh?" I responded, matching her excitement, my curiosity inevitably piqued by her enthusiasm.

Catherine cautiously glanced around, making sure no one was within earshot. She quickly pulled me into a secluded corner, lowering her voice although her excitement was hardly containable.

"My friend just messaged me with the most unbelievable news..." she began, her eyes widening with excitement.
"Bill White's allowance has been cut off!"

"His father has publicly announced that whoever dares to lend money to Bill will have to collect the debt from Bill himself!"
"Hle's made it explicitly clear that he won't help Bill repay any debts!"

"Which means..."

Catherine grinned mischievously, "Bill White might soon be poorer than me!"
Watching Catherine's delight over the impending downfall of someone
 

who had been arrogant and rude brought me a subtle sense of satisfaction.While I typically wouldn't rejoice in someone else's misfortune,Bill had certainly earned these consequences through his behavior.

Catherine added, her eyes gleaming with triumph: "Just think-Bill used to be the golden boy of our social circle."

"And now.penniless..."

"He can't be so arrogant anymore!"

I pondered the complexity of the situation and decided to temper her celebration with a reality check. "He might still maintain that attitude for a while," I cautiously said.

Catherine looked puzzled, "Why do you say that?"

I patiently explained, recalling patterns I'd observed when dealing with wealthy individuals: "Think about it-Bill is still Mr. White's beloved son.Even if Mr. White publicly states he won't help Bill repay his debts..."
"People will assume Mr. White is just saying that but still deeply loves his son."

"So to maintain good relations with Mr. White, some people will secretly help Bill,giving him money to spend."
"They'll try to gain Mr. White's favor this way."

"That way, when Mr. White eventually reconciles with Bill, Mr. White will remember their kindness toward his son and be more likely to do business with them."
Hearing my explanation, Catherine's face screwed up in disgust as if she'd
 

smelled something unpleasant. "Really? Is that necessary?"

"Perhaps not for us." I smiled, remembering how I too was once oblivious to these social maneuvers, "but for others, it might seem absolutely necessary."

Catherine looked somewhat disappointed, her shoulders drooping slightly,"So I got excited for nothing?"

I shook my head gently, wanting to balance her expectations, "Not entirely.The fact that Mr. White mnade such a public declaration indicates he genuinely wants to teach Bill a lesson."

"He hopes Bill will learn from his mistakes and improve his behavior."

"So either Mr. White will privately speak with these potential helpers,or find another way to make it clear he truly has no intention of repaying Bill's debts."

"Once people realize Mr. White is serious,they'll stop lending money to Bill."
Catherine's eyes widened, "Wow!" She seemed to perk up again, "So you're saying that if I'm patient enough, I'll eventually see everything I'm hoping for?"


I nodded, "Essentially, yes." I found myself more knowledgeable about the workings of high society than I'd expected, which surprised and somewhat proud of myself.
Catherine's eyes sparkled with anticipation, "I really want to mock him to his face,"
"Hmph!" she snorted contemptuously, "He came and made a scene in front
 

of me, disrupting my work..."

I watched Catherine's expression grow complex, seemingly torn between the satisfaction of revenge and the potential consequences. I waited quietly as she sorted through her thoughts.

After careful consideration, Catherine finally appeared to decide on the wiser course of action: "Focus on work, absolutely avoid looking at Bill White altogether," she muttered to herself.

I silently nodded in approval of her decision. Sometimes, the best revenge was simply continuing to live your best life without being distracted by those who had hurt you.

"Are you two discussing Bill White?" a familiar voice suddenly came from behind us.

Catherine jumped, and I felt her startle beside me. She only relaxed when she recognized the speaker, her hand gently pressing against her chest.
I turned to see Howard's secretary Susan, whose expression told me she had some interesting information to share. "What are you doing here?”I asked,somewhat surprised to encounter her in the hallway.

Susan lowered her voice, her face bearing that distinctive expression that people wear only when they're about to share bombshell gossip: "I have the latest news about Bill White. Want to hear it?"

Catherine and I immediately moved closer to Susan, and I could feel my curiosity fully engaged:"What is it?"
The Betrayed Wife's Revenge:Marrying the CEO

###Chapter 146: The Abandoned Son

Annie's POV

"I have the latest news about Bill White. Want to hear it?" Susan's voice suddenly came from behind us, startling both Catherine and me. We had been standing in a quiet corner of the hallway discussing Bill White's predicament, completely unaware of Susan's approach.

Susan's lips curled into a slight smile, her eyes sparkling with excitement.as if she could barely contain some shocking secret. After glancing around to ensure no one else was within earshot, she leaned forward, her voice dropping to just above a whisper.

Catherine and I instinctively moved closer to her. "What is it?" I asked softly, drawn in by her air of mystery.

"Pretty much as you guessed," Susan whispered, "many people have been lending money to Bill White." She paused, tilting her chin up slightly,her right hand delicately adjusting a strand of her hair as she waited for our reaction.

I noticed how Susan unconsciously straightened her back-a posture she typically adopted when in possession of particularly significant information.
"And then?" Catherine leaned forward, her eyes fixed intently on Susan.

"He had no intention of repaying any of it," Susan's voice carried a hint of schadenfreude, "he simply told everyone who lent him money to go ask my father for it.' These people thought he had reconciled with his father,so they all flocked to Mr. White demanding payment!" As she spoke,her right hand involuntarily made a circular motion in the air, as if illustrating the creditors surrounding Mr. White.
 

Susan leaned against the wall and continued: "Mr. White's company was barely staying afloat. It was only because Mr. Morgan and Mr. Thompson returned his investment that he had any chance of filling the financial gap."She shook her head, lips pressed together, "But the money his precious son borrowed already exceeds the total of all Mr. White's funds. If he truly helped Bill repay these debts, the entire family would collapse."

From Susan's slightly flushed cheeks and quickened breathing, I could tell this news must be very recent-she had hurried to share it with us.

"Are there really people this irresponsible in the world?" Catherine frowned,her fingers unconsciously tapping against her arm.

She pressed her lips together, her gaze flickering with realization: "I always thought I spent too much money, but compared to him, I'm incredibly disciplined."

"How did Mr. White react?" I broke the momentary silence,curious about what happened next.
Susan glanced around again, making sure the hallway remained empty before leaning closer: "Mr. White was so angry his facechanged color."She lowered her voice, her fingers clenched into a fist, mimicking an expression of fury, "He pointed at the group of creditors and said, 'I warned you all before, I won't help him repay a single cent! You should all abandon that idea!"

Susan's expression grew increasingly animated, her eyes gleaming: "Those creditors, afraid Bill wouldn't repay them, started gathering at his door demanding payment." She suddenly paused, her eyebrows arching upward,
 

Catherine's eyes widened as she leaned forward: "What?"

Susan's lips curved into asmirk, her voice tinged with mockery: "Bill claimed his girlfriend was pregnant, threatening that if Mr. White didn't help him repay his debts, he would make his girlfriend terminate the pregnancy."

I couldn't help but furrow my brow, a wave of discomfort rising in my stomach. Catherine gasped, her face showing evident disgust, her fingers unconsciously clutching at the hem of her clothing. Our eyes met, and without words, we understood each other's thoughts.

"That's too much," Catherine said, biting her lower lip, "I truly feel sorry for Mr. White, having such a despicable son."

"Mr. WNhite will have a lot to deal with," I nodded, my voice calmn and low.

Susan leaned against the wall of the corridor and continued: "Mr.White clearly didn't expect Bill to be soshameless, but this time he stood his ground.He told Bill directly: 'If you want to terminate the pregnancy,that s up to you. No one's stopping you."
She took a deep breath, "Everyone thought that if Bill quietly left and apologized after Mr. White calmed down, father and son might still have a chance at reconciliation, but.,." she deliberately paused, her eyebrows raised high.
"Bill did something even more foolish?" Catherine raised her hand to cover her mouth.
Susan nodded, her lips pressed tight: "Bill publicly insulted Mr. White,and the old man was so angry he ended up in the hospital, reportedly almost suffering a stroke. Fortunately, he received thrombolytic therapy in
 

time and is now recovering." She glanced down at her watch, "If I'm not mistaken, we should be able to see an official statement from the White family now."


Catherine and I simultaneously pulled out our phones to check the latest news. My fingers slid across the screen, quickly finding the announcement from White's company: Mr. White had officially severed ties with Bill White. The statement declared that since Bill wwas an adult, he should be responsible for his own choices. From now on, Bill's actions would have nothing to do with Mr. White, who would no longer interfere in Bill's affairs.

After reading it. Catherine couldn't help but smile: "Abandoned by his own father! Bill's future will be miserable!" Her voice contained undisguised satisfaction.

"No need to wait for the future," Susan moved closer to us, her voice barely above a whisper, "he's already miserable. That Grace Brown who claimed to be pregnant immediately broke up with him after he lost his family's support, telling him the pregnancy was fake and she had been deceiving him all along."

Susan's fingers made slight gestures, as if recreating the scene: "Bill didn't believe it and grabbed Grace's shoulders, demanding to know if she hadn't said she loved him. Grace pushed him away in disgust and told him directly that she never loved him-those words were only to make him spend money on her."

"Serves him right!" Catherine clapped her hands once, her eyes flashing with vengeful pleasure.
Just when I thought the story had ended, Susan's expression suddenly changed. She looked at Catherine with a hint of sympathy in her eyes.

Catherine noticed and immediately frowned: "What is it?"

Susan slowly exhaled: "I heard that after being dumped, Bill started thinking about you again."

"What does he want with me?" Catherine's shoulders visibly tensed, the smile disappearing from her face. Her fingers anxiously intertwined, clearly worried that Bill might cause her trouble again.

"He said that after Grace's betrayal, he realized what a wonderful woman he had given up," Susan's lips curved upward, "Now he wants to win this woman back."

"Ha!" Catherine let out a cold laugh, her eyes flashing with derision,"He missed out on me? Were we ever together? Never!" Her voice unconsciously rose.

Susan patted Catherine's shoulder, her expression turning serious: "He has nothing to do now, which means he might have plenty of time to pursue you."

"That's impossible!" Catherine widened her eyes, shaking her head almost in horror, "He's gone too far! After being abandoned, instead of looking for Grace, he comes after me?" Her pale cheeks flushed wit anger, "Do I look like a garbage collector? Someone who accepts any trash? What kind of person is he!"

She nervously smoothed her clothes, as if trying to shake off Bill's very existence. Then she turned to me, her tone suddenly dejected: "I was planning to have lunch with you, but I think the moment I leave the company,he'll be lying in wait." She bit her lower lip, "I'll be safer eating in the company cafeteria... I'm sorry."
Before I could respond. Catherine turned and hurried away, her high heels making sharp, rapid sounds against the marble floor. I couldn't help but smile, watching her nervous figure retreat. Though her situation deserved sympathy, there was something slightly amusing about it.

With the gossip sharing complete. Susan's expression suddenly turned serious. She straightened her posture, as if returning to wwork mode:"By the way, there's something I need to tell you. Sarah Johnson has been disparaging your work while promoting her comics,claiming her data is better and that she surpassed in days what took us months to build. As a result, many of our readers have gone to look at her work instead."

I pressed my lips together. Though I knew readers had plenty of time to read different comics, Sarah's underhanded tactics deserved a response-ignoring them would only make us look like easy targets. I replied calmly:"If she wants to borrow our popularity, then we can borrow hers too."
Susan's eyes flashed with surprise, then her lips curved into a slight smile:"I know what to do." She walked toward the elevator, glancing back at me once before stepping inside.
 
###Chapter 147: Otherwise, Wouldn't I Seem Ungrateful?

Annie's POV

After my conversation with Susan about Sarah's tactics, I made my way back to Howard's office. As I approached the door, I could hear Howard's voice emanating from inside.

"Philip is gone," Howard said as I entered, his gaze immediately finding my eyes, thecorner of his mouth lifting in a barely perceptible smile.I looked at him, noticing a certain ease in his expression that hadn't been there when Philip was present.

"Let's head back," he suggested, lightly touching my arm.

"Alright," I answered, following him toward the office.

Even before I could ask, Howard anticipated my curiosity. "Want to know what Philip said to me after you left?"

"Hmm?" I responded, my interest piqued.

Howard continued casually, "Philip seems to think you're right. Comparing his behavior, he does appear to genuinely care about Sarah. But he still doesn't understand why he thinks of you when you're not around." His tone suggested he found Philip's confusion somewhat amusing as his fingers gently tucked a stray strand of hair behind my ear.
I raised an eyebrow. "What advice did you offer him?"

Howard answered honestly, "I suggested he see a therapist." He gave me a questioning look. "Do you think my suggestion was too harsh?"
 

I shook my head firmly, the corner of my mouth turning up slightly. "Not at all."


"Actually. I've noticed he seems quite conflicted lately..." I reflected,thinking back on Philip's recent behavior. "He constantly comes to profess his feelings for me, but when it comes to actually making any effort,he's completely unwilling. Of course. I'm not saying he should be buying me things..."

Howard took my hand, giving it a gentle squeeze while smiling. "I understand," he said, understanding in his eyes.

His acknowledgment made me feel safe, grounded. A small smile played on my lips as I continued, "It's just that when I love someone, I'm willing to give myself to that person... my time, my energy. If I had money,I'd spend it without hesitation too. But for Philip, it's all just empty words.With Sarah, it's completely different. He claims not to love her, yet he's willing to give her everything. This contradiction, to me, suggests there really is some psychological issue at play. Seeing a doctor would be a good thing. If there's truly a problem, he should address it sooner rather than later."

Howard nodded,his gaze warm and concerned as he looked at me.

I didn't voice my thought; hoping that after therapy, he would honestly recognize his feelings for Sarah, take proper responsibility for her,and ultimately stop interfering in my life.
Howard nodded in agreement. "Exactly," he said, giving my shoulder a gentle squeeze.
As we entered the office, he placed his hand lightly on the small of my back, the touch sending a momentary flutter through me. I could feel the

warmth of his fingertips through my blouse, this simple contact reminding me of our intimacy on the balcony last night.

He guided me toward the sofa rather than the work area, and I complied,sensing a different atmosphere flowing between us. I settled comfortably into the familiar couch, staring at the ceiling, feeling an unprecedented relaxation, alongside a subtle tension born from his proximity.

"Here," Howard said, handing mea glass of water, his fingers brushing against mine accidentally, leaving a trace of warmth.

I took it without thinking, looking up at him with mild surprise. Our eyes met, and a silent understanding passed between us.

Howard smiled as he explained, "I poured this before Philip arrived. It was hot then, but it should be just the right temperature now." His voice was lower than usual, with an intimacy that only I could detect.

I was touched by his thoughtfulness-such a simple gesture demonstrating his attentiveness. I took a small sip, finding the temperature indeed perfect.
"You always know what I need," I said softly.

Howard sat beside me, closer than usual, his thigh lightly pressing against míne. I naturally leaned against his shoulder, inhaling the familiar faint scent of his cològne mingled with a scent that was uniquely his. I reflected that although he had done many things for me before, somehow this simple act of consideration made me feel a sense of security I had never experienced before.

"How did I get so lucky to have such a wonderful boyfriend?" I said,turning to look at him, our faces inches apart.
Howard's gaze fell to my lips, his eyes growing deeper. "I'm the lucky one,"

he murmured, his voice carrying a huskiness I rarely heard, reminding me of our intimate moments in the bedroom last night.

I felt a warmth spread from my cheeks throughout my body. The better Howard treated me, the more it highlighted how difficult those years with Philip had been. His fingertips gently traced my cheek, like a silent promise, making me unconsciously tilt my head slightly toward his touch.

I remembered once when I was sick and asked Philip for water. He brought me a scalding hot cup, and when I wanted to wait for it to cool,his face twisted with contempt.

"Didn't you just say you were thirsty? Why aren't you drinking it? Are you pretending? Just so I'Il wait on you?" he had demanded aggressively.

I was feverish and dizzy at the time, unable to believe these words were coming from my own partner.

Philip had stared at me accusingly. "You have enough energy to glare at me but not enough to pour your own water? Who are you trying to fool? I'm not listening to you anymore, and I certainly won't do anything for you!11


Each of his words had cut into my heart like a sharp knife. It stood in stark contrast to Howard's gentle attentiveness now.
In fact, counting all the things Philip had ever done for me, that cup of water might havebeen the only thing.
I watched him leave, slamming the door hard enough to shake the walls.

Even then,divorce hadn't crossed my mind. I just thought that I needed to be more independent, not rely on a man.

After all. we come into this world alone and will ultimately leave it alone.

So the only person I could truly rely on was myself.

I gradually learned to suppress my feelings, to accommodate Philip ín our shared life.


But today, I finally realized-

I don't need to feel uncomfortable. My boyfriend is willing to pour water for me.

We don't need to argue over little things we can easily do for each other.

And he would never get angry over such trivial matters.

I was grateful that I had found Howard.

He thoughtfully took care of everything for me.

I lowered my gaze. "Thank you."

"Why so formal with me?" Howard asked, gently stroking my hair,his fingertips deliberately brushing the sensitive spot behind my ear that he knew well. "It's not a big deal."
I hugged him tightly, feeling the warmth of his chest and his steady heartbeat. "But when two people live together, isn't daily life made up of these small gestures? You pay attention to these little things. Doesn't that mean I don't even need to worry about the big things?" I looked up at him,feeling the air between us grow warmer with our proximity.
Howard didn't deny it. "I feel that doing things for you is simply what I should do," his voice was low, his gaze not leaving my eyes, and for a moment, his glance fell to my lips.
 

"Then I should express my gratitude." I responded with a soft laugh."
Otherwise,wouldn't I seem ungrateful?"

Howard drewcloser to me, gently cupping my face in his hands, his gaze slowly descending from my eyesto my lips. "So, how do you plan to express your gratitude?"
 
###Chapter 148: Betty Baker's Name Becomes Trending

Annie's POV

"Otherwise, wouldn't I seem ungrateful?" I had barely finished my sentence when Howard drew closer to me, gently cupping my face in his hands,his gaze slowly descending from my eyes to my lips. "So,how do you plan to express your gratitude?"

The playful challenge in his tone sent a shiver down my spine. I leaned into his touch, feeling the warmth of his palm against my cheek. The atmosphere in the office had shifted, becoming charged with tension that had nothing to do with work. I noticed Howard's eyes darkening with unmistakable desire.

He suddenly stood up, striding quickly to the door. With deliberate movements, he turned the lock. The crisp "click" sounded unusually pronounced in the quiet office. When he turned to face me again, his gaze burned with naked desire.

"No one will disturb us now," he said, his voice uncharacteristically husky.

We practically lunged toward each other. Urgent kisses, breathless gasps,and the sound of clothing being hastily removed filled the space between us. His suit jacket dropped to the floor, his tie loosened, several shirt buttons popping open. My blouse was pushed up, my skirt bunching around my waist.
Howard's strong hands gripped my thighs, lifting me effortlessly before setting me down on his spacious desk. Documents scattered,a pencil holder toppled over, but we were far beyond caring about such trivial
 

matters. His lips traveled from mine down my neck. alongmy collarbone.and lower still. I tilted my head back, unable to suppress the sounds
escaping from my throat.

I could feel his body heat, his strength, and his urgent desire.

"Are you sure?" Even consumed by passion,,he still sought my consent.

"Yes, now." I gasped in response, wrapping my legs around his waist.

When he finally joined with me, a wave of intense satisfaction coursed through my body. He began to move-slowly at first,then gradually increasing his pace. The desk swayed slightly with our movements,but neither of us paid it any mind. My fingers dug into his shoulders,nails pressing into his skin.

"Howard..." I breathed his name like a prayer.

He leaned down to kiss me, swallowing my whispers. Our bodies moved in perfect synchronization, finding a rhythm that belonged only to us. His arms encircled me completely, holding me tightly against him as though afraid I might vanish if he loosened his grip.
Pleasure built within me like an electrical current, growing more intense until that final moment-we reached the peak together, our bodies tensing before gradually relaxing into each other.
We held each other, catching our breath, skin glistening with perspiration.Howard placed a gentle kiss on my forehead, his fingers tenderly brushing away strands of hair that clung to my cheek.
"I love you, Annie," he whispered, his voice carrying a rare vulnerability.

"I love you too," I replied, resting against his chest, listening to his
  gradually steadying heartbeat.

We slowly began to compose ourselves. He helped fasten my buttons while I fixed his tie, our mutual assistance carrying an intimate understanding as if we'd been together for years. As we restored order to the disheveled desk, exchanging knowing glances. I felt an unprecedented sense of contentment and security.


Just as we had finally restored the office to its original state,and I had picked up my pencil to continue sketching my illustration draft,Howard's phone rang, breaking the comfortable silence between us.

Howard glanced at the screen, then looked at me. "Annie, Susan wants to speak with you. She says it's important," he said, passing me his phone.his expression calm but eyes curious.

I casually took the phone, putting it on speaker so Howard could hear as well. I continued drawing, my pencil moving easily across the paper while waiting for Susan to speak.

Susan's professional voice came through clearly: "You need to pause what you're working on and check the trending news online right away."

Intrigued, I set down my pencil and picked up my own phone. Opening the news app, I was surprised to see Betty Baker's name trending. Clicking on the headline, I was shocked to discover it was a post by Betty Baker herself on a well-known Upper East Side social forum. She was seeking public "judgment" on whether her treatment of her "former daughter-in-law" had been reasonable. Though she hadn't mentioned me by name, the details in the post made it obvious to anyone familiar with the Baker family that she was talking about me.
As I scrolled through the post, its contents stunned me. Betty had writen:

"Is it wrong to expect a daughter-in-law to meet our family's standards?""What's wrong with pointing out when a daughter-in-law doesn't understand etiquette or the rules of our social circle?" "She came from an ordinary family in Boston and only knew how to draw childish pictures-she was completely unsuitable for my son's social status."

In the post. Betty also defended her actions: "I prepared clothing guidelines for various occasions, but she claimed I was interfering with her freedom; I corrected her dining etiquette, but she called me harsh.Is it wrong to maintain the Baker family's dignity?"

Most surprisingly, Betty openly admitted: "I did tell my son that if she couldn't give the Baker family an intelligent heir, it would be better to end the marriage early. Isn't thecontinuation of the family bloodline the most important thing?"

The comments below the post mostly took my side, with users easily deducing that the "former daughter-in-law" was me:
"You're talking about Annie Baker, right? She's now a rising star in children's illustration!"

"Betty, your statements are simply unbelievable. No wonder your son's marriage failed."
"Look at Annie's relationship with Howard Thompson now, and it's clear the problem wasn't with her."
Someone had even uncovered more details: "According to my sources.Betty once deliberately arranged incorrect cutlery at a dinner just to embarrass Annie. That behavior is absolutely despicable."
The comment section had exploded:

"Is this the true face of Upper East Side socialites? Disgusting!"

"Betty Bakeris the epitome of the evil mother-in-law. And her son never stood up for his wife?"

"No wonder Annie Baker ultimately chose to leave. Who could live in such a family environment?"


"Howard Thompson and Annie Baker are truly a perfect match. It's obvious how much he values her."

The post also revealed details of Betty's various "social tests," with one user commenting: "My friend was once a guest at Betty's home and witnessed firsthand how she mistreated her former daughter-in-law, such as deliberately setting complicated Western cutlery on the table and then mocking her for not knowing how to use them."

Another commenter added: "She also frequently arranged for her daughter-in-law to be seated in corner positions at important social events, making her feel isolated."

Reading these comments, I felt a strange sense of calm. All those questions that had once troubled me, those suspicions I hadn't dared confirm,now had answers.

Just as I was about to close my phone, a new comment appeared:

"This is just the tip of the iceberg. What Betty Baker did to Annie goes far beyond this."
My fingers froze.

"Annie?" Howard's voice pulled me back to reality. "Susan is still waiting for your response."
 
###Chapter 149: The World Is Actually Quite Far

Annie's POV

"Annie?" Howard's voice pulled me back to reality. "Susan is still waiting for your response."


I stared at the comment on the screen: "This is just the tip of the iceberg.What Betty Baker did to Annie goes far beyond this." My fingers hovered over my phone, momentarily frozen by the flood of memories that single comment had triggered. I took a deep breath, steadying myself before responding to Susan.

"T've seen it aIl," I answered calmly, my voice more stable than I had expected. "What happens next?"

Susan's professional tone carried a hint of hesitation as she explained, "The marketing department wants to use this trending topic to increase our public visibility. They wanted to get your permission first."

I couldn't help but feel touched by the thoughtfulness of Howard Technologies' employees. Whether it was when Sarah tried to climb over me to advance herself, or now with Betty's scandal breaking, they always consulted me before taking any action.
I fell silent for a moment, feelings churning inside me. Was it appropriate to use my former mother-in-law's scandal to boost my career? But then again,memories of Betty's years of harassment and mockery washed over me like waves-those deliberately set dining etiquette traps, those thinly veiled insults, and all the ways she had pushed me into social corners...
The feeling of being belittled is hard to forget.
 

"Of course," I finally responded. my voice more resolute than before. "You're all working to help grow our business. I have no objections."

Susan paused before continuing, concern evident in her voice: "We were worried that leveraging Betty's negative news might bring back unpleasant memories for you."


Clearly,after reading the news, everyone had finally glimpsed how diffcult my life in the Baker household had been. They saw this as an excellent opportunity but worried it might reopen old wounds.

I let out a soft laugh. "Don't worry," I assured her. "That's all in the past.I won't take it to heart."

Hearing my reassurance, Susan's tone noticeably relaxed. "Then I'll immediately relay your decision to the marketing department."

"Good," I replied, ending the call.

Within hours of the marketing team taking action, our exposure rate skyrocketed. My comics once again captured public attention, reader numbers increased dramatically, and merchandise sales surged.Susan received multiple calls fromn companies in neighboring countries, all eager to acquire various distribution rights for the comics.

She handled these inquiries professionally, neither directly accepting nor rejecting their proposals. Instead, she informed them that she needed to discuss the matter with me first, and would get back to them once we reached a decision. The callers were all respectful, agreeing to wait for her response.
In our work group chat, employees celebrated as data soared:

"Amazing! Click-through rates have increased by 238%!" one employee

messaged.

"We finally broke through a 15%o conversion rate, our efforts these past few months weren't wasted!" another colleague chimed in.

"Seeing so many readers leaving comments supporting Annie's work feels incredibly satisfying!"

"This exposure is a godsend for our project; yesterday's newly released Chapter already has over 100.000 views!"

Messages kept appearing in the work group chat, with everyone sharing rising data from their respective areas. The joy of witnessing the fruits of their collective effort was palpable. Howard had previously promised that if the project succeeded, every team member would share in the results.making everyone particularly invested in the performance of the comics and related merchandise.

I handed the phone back to Howard, who casually took it and sat down beside me. He draped his arm over my shoulders and softly asked, "How do you feel about seeing that news?"

Without hesitation, I answered, "Like a long-held suspicion finally confirmed.It feels strange, but also satisfying."
I gazed thoughtfully into the distance. "I'm also thinking... when Philip finally discovers that the child in Sarah's womb isn't his, he'll completely despise Betty."

"After all, she was the one who encouraged him to reject hisown son.yet pour all his love into someone else's child."
My lips curled into an involuntary smile. "Betty's later years certainly won't be happy."
 	小J

"Neither will Philip's." I added.

"Just thinking about how miserable the people who hurt me will be in the future makes me feel that the world is actually quite fair."

Howard's large hand gently slid across my shoulder, a comforting gesture,as if trying to ease any lingering tension.

I knew he was worried I might be upset, so I smiled reassuringly. "Don't worry. It's all in the past. I really don't care anymore."

"Hmm." Howard cupped my face in his hands and planted a kiss on my forehead. "I just wish I could have entered your life earlier."

I looked at him questioningly.

Howard's usually stern gaze was now filled with tenderness and concern."
Then you wouldn't have had to endure so much unfair treatment."

I was surprised, clearly not expecting him to take responsibility for these past events.

I chuckled lightly, "None of this was your fault."

Howard didn't respond verbally, just pulled me tightly into his embrace.
His fingers traced gently down my spine,conveying comfort and affection.

After a moment of silence, Howard suddenly asked, "Annie, do you know what it means to add joy to happiness?"
I looked up into his eyes, slightly surprised by the desire burning in them."No, what?" My voice carried a hint of curiosity.
Howard's gaze intensified, his fingers trailing along my jawline before lifting my chin. "Then let me teach you."
 

Suddenly realizing his implication, I playfully pushed against his chest.laughing."Howard Thompson, we just finished a moment ago. and you're ready for more already?"


The corner of his lips turned upward, his gray eyes fixed intently on mine."Because you look so sexy when you're happy." His voice was deep and husky. like a feather brushing against my ear, sending a shiver through me.

Before I could answer, his lips covered mine. He gently pushed me back onto the spacious leather sofa, and we both sank into the soft leather. The couch made a slight sound, bearing the weight of our entwined bodies.

Howard's kisses gradually became more urgent, one hand braced beside my head, the other beginning to unbutton my blouse. The edge of the sofa pressed against my back, its cool sensation creating a stark contrast with Howard's burning palm.

"Someone might come in..." I tried to remind him between rapid breaths,but my rationality was already beginning to crumble under his touch.
Howard's lips left mine to whisper in my ear, "The door is locked,remember?" His breath brushed against my earlobe, making me tremble involuntarily.

His hand slippeèd inside my half-open blouse, his warm palm caressing my skin, each touch sending a wave of tremors through me. His lips traveled down my neck, tasting my collarbone, then lower. My fingers dug into the leather surface of the sofa, my head tilting back as I let out an uncontrollable moan.

Howard looked up, taking in my face flushed with desire, his eyes darker than I'd ever seen them. He quickly removed his suit jacket and tie, then leaned down to continue kissing my lips.
 

Just as he was taking the lead.a thought suddenly flashed through my mind.Catching him off guard. I pushed against his chest, forcing him to sit upright. Confusion flickered in Howard's eyes, quickly replaced by surprise as I flipped over to straddle his thighs.

"My turn," I whispered, feeling the excitement of being in control.

Howard's gaze grew even more intense, his hands settling on my waist,not rushing to control the pace but allowing me to take the lead. I leaned down to kiss him, savoring the sweetness of his lips while my hands slowly unbuttoned his shirt, touching his warm chest.

I could feel Howard's breathing becoming more rapid, his fingers digging deep into my waist, but he restrained himself, letting me set my own rhythm. The sofa swayed slightly with our movements, the leather surface making subtle sounds against our perspiring skin.

I gripped Howard's shoulders and began to move my body slowly. He looked up at me, his eyes filled with a mixture of love and desire."Annie..."he called my name softly, his voice slightly hoarse from restraint.
I leaned down to kiss him while increasing my pace. Howard's hands moved from my waist to my back, pulling me closer, deepening the kiss.Our breaths mingled, our bodies fitting together so perfectly, as if made for each other.

Pleasure built in waves, layer upon layer, until I could bear it no longer.I clutched his shoulders tightly, losing all sense of time in the pinnacle of ecstasy. Howard reached his peak as well, his body tensing before releasing a deep breath.
I collapsed in his arms, my head resting on his shoulder, feeling our rapid heartbeats gradually steadying. Howard's arms encircled me tightly, as if
 

never wanting to let go. He gently kissed my forehead, his fingers tenderly brushing away strands of hair clinging to my cheeks.

"You never cease to amaze me, Annie," he said softly, his voice carrying a rare vulnerability.

We remained in that position for a long time, enjoying the tranquility after intimacy. Howard's fingers gently combed through my hair,his movements tender and reverent.

"Thank you, Howard," I whispered.
 
###Chapter 150:That Bitch!

Sarah's POV

I lounged comfortably on the sofa in my apartment, savoring the satisfaction of sliding my finger across my phone screen. Over the past few days, the sales data for my comics had been'steadily climbing,bringing me unprecedented joy. Those numbers were like a sweet melody, constantly playing the tune of success just for me.

"Finally!" I couldn't help but exclaim softly, admiring the positive comments from readers.

All those luxury items I'd added to my shopping cart weeks ago suddenly seemed within reach. I cleared my cart without hesitation,imagining Max's ecstatic expression when he received his new gaming console.

I had even planned to take him to the most exclusive restaurant in the city.one of those places you need to book months in advance, where we could look down upon the city lights. The waiters would greet us with impeccable couresy, and other socialites would whisper among themselves:"Look, isn't that Sarah Johnson,the successful comic artist?"
Just as I was immersed in this delightful fantasy, a notification popped up on my phone screen-Betty Baker had become a trending topic.
"Betty Baker? Trending?" I frowned, my finger quickly tapping to see more. "What did she do? Host another charity event?"
The content on the screen made my eyes light up-Betty Baker had publicly discussed how she "disciplined" her so-called "former daughter-in-law." Though Annie wasn't directly named in the post, anyone in our social circle would know exactly who she meant. My lips curved upward,
 

thinking that Betty had finally snapped and decided to put that pretentious Boston country girl in her place.

I raised an eyebrow as I quickly scanned the content, a glimmer of amusement in my eyes. In her post, Betty admitted she had prepared clothing guidelines for Annie, corrected her table manners, and even bluntly stated that if she couldn't give the Baker family an intelligent heir,it would be better to end the marriage early.

"What's wrong with that?" I snorted softly, completely agreeing with Betty's viewpoint. That ordinary girl from Boston truly didn't deserve to enter high society; she definitely needed that guidance. Betty was merely fulfilling her duty as a mother, protecting her family's dignity and bloodline.

However, as I scrolled down to read the comments, the smile on my face gradually froze. Almost everyone was siding with Annie, condemning Betty's behavior as "appalling" and calling it "the true face of Upper East Side socialites." Others revealed that Betty had deliberately arranged incorrect cutlery just to embarrass Annie and seated her in corner positions at important social events to make her feel isolated.

"What fools," I muttered, feeling a wave of unease. These commenters clearly didn't understand the strict standards required to mnaintain a family's status.
Suddenly, I noticed another trending topic under Betty's name-Annie Baker and her comics. A sense of foreboding washed over me as I quickly tapped on it.
The sight before me felt like being plunged into ice water.

Annie's comic sales had surged nearly 300% in just a few hours! I stared
 

wide-eyed. unable to believe the numbers I was seeing. Her comment section was filled with supportive voices, and the traffic to her merchandise page was almost crashing the servers.

"That bitch!" I jumped up from the sofa, nearly crushing my phone in my grip. "She dares to exploit Betty's situation for her own gain!"

Anger boiled like magma inside me; my chest heaved violently, my breathing becoming rapid and heavy. I wanted to hurl my phone at the wall but controlled myself at the last moment-this was the latest limited edition, worth a small fortune.

I looked around, my gaze settling on the expensive crystal vases on the coffee table. The next second, I grabbed one and smashed it violently on the floor. Fragments scattered,water splashed everywhere.

"Aah!" I screamed, but it wasn't enough.

I seized a second vase and threw it with all my strength toward the corner.With a sharp "crash," the vase exploded against the wall,shards raining down like crystal hail.
"Damn you, Annie Baker!" I roared, grabbing the third vase, this time aiming at the decorative painting across the room. The vasesailed through the air and shattered the abstract artwork I had never truly appreciated.
I stood amid the wreckage, my chest still heaving rapidly, but my fury had finally subsided slightly. I pushed back my disheveled hair,catching my breath as I stared at those glaring numbers on my phone. This woman had achieved in one day what I couldn't accomplish even after spending over a million dollars on marketing. All she did was ride the wave of Betty Baker's scandal, stealing attention and profits that should have been mine.

I paced back and forth in the living room, my footsteps echoing in what now seemed an excessively spacious room. Everything I had planned-shopping, lunch, promises to Max-had evaporated. I picked up my phone to contact the marketing company, then realized that any additional publicity would only give that woman more opportunities to climb over me.

Suddenly, an idea struck me. I knew what to do.

I quickly fixed my makeup, wiping away the traces of tears from the corners of my eyes, and headed straight for the garage.

"To Philip Investment Group," I commanded, and the driver immediately started the car.

Upon arriving at Philip's company, I wwalked directly toward his office. The receptionist and secretary knew me as the boss's wife, and no one dared stop me. But at the door, I chose to knock-in case business partners were present, I didn't want to create an awkward situation.

"Come in," Philip's voice called out.

I pushed open the door to find my husband buried in a pile of documents.When he looked up and saw me, his brow relaxed slightly.

"Darling," I began straightforwardly, my voice carrying a slight tremor as if I were struggling to control my emotions, "do you know what's happening online?"

"What is it?" Philip set down the documents, his expression becoming alert.

"Your mother... she's trending," I said carefully, "and Annie is using it to promote her comics."
Philip immediately picked up his phone to search. Seeing the content on
 

the screen, his expression rapidly changed from confusion to shock,then to disbelief and anger.


"How dare these people comment on my mother this way!" he said through gritted teeth. gripping his phone so tightly his knuckles turned white. "Mother was only doing what anyone who cares about their family would do!"


I sat down beside him, gently stroking his arm, soothing him: "Of course,she was just trying to protect the Baker family's reputation."

"These internet users don't understand the rules of high society," Philip said angrily, eyes still fixed on the screen. "They're portraying Mother as some kind of monster."

I seized the opportunity to add: "And look, Annie's comics are selling like crazy because of this. Her fan count has skyrocketed, and her sales have multiplied several times in just hours."

Philip stared at the data in shock, his eyes growing colder.

"This can't be a coincidence," I said softly, as if thinking aloud, "she must have planned all this... orchestrated this controversy just to promote her comics."

Philip was silent for a few seconds, the fire in his eyes burning ever brighter.
"Are you suggesting..." he began slowly, "that Annie might be behind this?That she deliberately directed public opinion against my mother for her own commercial benefit?"

"Think about it," I encouraged gently, "who's the biggest beneficiary? Only Annie. And Betty has never been the type to publicly discuss family
 

matters... unless someone manipulated her."

Philip suddenly stood up, adjusting his tie. "I'm going to confront her and get to the bottom of this. If she's truly been manipulating things behind the scenes, hurting my mother..." he didn't finish, but the determination in his eyes said it all.

"T'm going now," he declared, "wait for my news at home."

"Alright, darling," I responded softly, my eyes conveying concern, "don't be too impulsive, remember to stay calm."

But internally, I thought: *Be impulsive, the more intense, the better.*

Philip hurriedly left his office. I waited until his footsteps disappeared down the hallway before slowly allowing a smile to form on my lips. I knew what he would do-he would storm into Howard Technologies and confront Annie in front of everyone. All I needed to do was follow him and document everything.

I walked out of the office, took the elevator down, and watched as Philip's car drove away. I immediately got into my own car.
"To Howard Technologies," I instructed the driver, quickly organizing my phone in my purse,ensuring I had enough battery and storage space.
The plan was proceeding smoothly. Soon, Annie Baker would taste the consequences of betraying others.
###Chapter 151: How Dare She Do This to My Mother?

Philip's POV

I stoed ourside the Howard Technologies building my phone cluched rightly in my hand, the screen displaying the news of my mother Betty Baker trending online. Anger burned like at raging fire in my chest.growing more intense with each passing second.

That bitch!" I silently cursed Annie. "How dare she do this to my mother?



I couldn't resist scrolling through those vicious comments again,witnessing how people attacked my mother, feeling both furious and heartbroken. My mother had always been a respectable Upper East Side socialite, and now she was being mercilessly criticized by internet users.

How could these people possibly understand the rules of our social circle?They had no idea that my mother was simply fulfilling her responsibility,protecting our family's dignity.

I recalled how my mother had always protected me throughout my life. In high school, when I had a dispute with my golf coach, she personally showed up to ensure my position was supported.

During college, when my thesis was questioned for plagiarism issues,she made a substantial donation that prompted the school administration to intervene.


Even when problems arose in my marriage with Annie,mother consistently stood by my side, never questioning my decisions. She was always the one who smoothed everything over for me. And now, this woman who once hung on my every word was exploiting my mother's predicament for her own gain? I waited at the building entrance, determined to confront her face-to-face.

Soon enough, I spotted Annie and Howard walking out of the building together.Howard leaned down to whisper something to her, and she nodded slightly, as if she had anticipated my arrival. This deepened my anger-she knew what was coming yet remained so calm.

I strode toward them, barely able to control the fury in my voice: "Annie,what exactly are you trying to do?"

She looked up at me with a puzzled expression that I was certain was fake.
"Me? I'm not trying to do anything, Philip. I don't know what you're talking about."


I quickly pulled out my phone and thrust the screen toward her face."This!" I almost roared, the phone nearly touching her face. "My mother becomes a trending topic, and suddenly your comics get massive traffic. Is that a coincidence?"


Before Annie could respond, Howard had already grabbed my wrist with a grip so powerful it caused me pain. In that moment, I felt tremendous pressure from his palm, almost crushing my wrist bone. I silently regretted being too busy with work to visit the gym regularly.

Howard's gaze was sharp as a knife, carrying an icy warning that instinctively made me feel a flicker of fear. Buat I immediately suppressed this emotion-I absolutely couldn't show weakness in front of Annie.

Howard's voice was cold as ice: "If you have something to say, just say it.There's no need to push a phone in her face." I struggled to free my hand from his grip, feeling humiliated but still standing my ground. "I know you have issues with mebut..,"I tried to make my tone sound more persuasive, "if you have a problem, you could come directly to me. Dragging my mother into this isn't very polite, is it?"

Annie's lips curved into a sardonic smile. "Polite? That's an interesting word coming fromn your mouth."


Her smile felt strange to me. This was completely different from the Annie I remembered-the fragile one who always tried to please everyone.

"Your family was never particularly polite to me either, was it?" she continued, her tone disturbingly calm. "Besides, I didn't drag your mother into anything. I simply took advantage of the attention when your mother was being criticized online."


I stared at her, suddenly feeling like I was looking at a stranger. "If it wasn't you, then who was it?"


"Could it have been my mother?" Howard suddenly interjected, his tone carrying a meaningful undertone.


"Your mother?" I asked, confused. "Why would she do that?"

Howard calmly replied, "You should watch this video." He took out his phone and pulled up a video I had never seen before.


I stared intently at the screen. The video Howard played was one I had never seen, related to the post my mother had published on the social forum a few days ago,but clearly recorded before the post was published.

In the footage, my mother was conversing with Margaret Thompson at a private social gathering. Mother appeared completely confident, utterly unaware that the spoke at length criticizing Annie, saying she "didn't understand etiquette,"was "from an ordinary background,"

and "didn't deserve to enter high society"-almost word for word repeating what would later appear in her forum post.

What shocked me most was how Margaret.Thompson's seemingly casual questions were actually cleverly designed to draw out more harsh critiques of Annie from my mother. I even noticed Margaret subtly nodding encouragingly when my mother said something particularly cutting,while my mother, completely obliviouis to the trap, continued to spout the very remarks that would later subject her to intense online criticism.

In the final part of the video, my mother even stated bluntly: "If Annie can't give the Baker family an intelligent heir, Philip would be better off ending the marriage early."

After watching the video, I browsed through some comments and discovered more information: evidently, shortly after my mother's post, this video was anonymously uploaded online, causing public opinion to shift completely in Annie's favor. My mother had intended to gain support through her post, to prove her attitude toward Annie was justified,but instead inadvertently triggered this storm.


I felt dizzy. I looked up at Annie, trying to regain my position: "Even if your view of her is correct, you shouldn't have-"

"There's nothing I shouldn't have done," Annie firmly interrupted me. "Philip, your family can't keep hurting me without facing any consequences.



Her gaze was steady and clear: "The current situation is quite fair... she approached me with malicious intent, and I used her to make money." I shook my head. unable to believe what I was hearing: "You've changed.Annie. You never used to care about money."

"Now you seem obsessed with it." I added accusingly.

Annie laughed, and the sound stung my ears: "It's precisely because I didn't value material things that I walked away fsom our divorce empty-handed.allowing a cheating bastard like you to retain substantial assets and live happily with your lover."

Her words pierced my heart like a sharp blade: "Looking back on my behavior that day, I realize how terribly wrong I was. I should have demanded money. At least that would have ensured I wouldn't face financial difficulties after the divorce."

I was speechless. The confident. powerful woman before me was nothing like the gentle, compliant ex-wife I remembered.

"Fortunately, I received Howard's help immediately after the divorce."Annie continued, her voice tinged with gratitude. "He's given me a better living environment than you ever did, provided job opportunities, and helped me earn money and understand its importance."

She looked at me, her gaze unwavering: "Philip, money solves most problems in my life. When news appears that can help me earn more, and I didn't actively create the trouble myself, why shouldn't I take advantage of it?"


I felt powerless, grasping at my last straw: "She's my mother."

"So what?" Annie scoffed.

I froze, not knowing how to respond to such a smple question. "You and I no longer care about each other, so why should I care about an ex-mother-in-law who only knew how to bully me?" Annie said calmly. "I hope you can understand that."

Then she took HowardI's hand: "Let's go eat."

"Alright." Howard responded simply.

Watching their retreating figures. I felt an unprecedented sense of loss and anger. "Annie, you'll regret this." I called after them, my voice filled with unresolved resentment.


But Annie didn't even turn around, as if my existence had become completely meaningless to her. I stood there, watching them disappear around the street corner, feeling my world crumbling. I never imagined there would come a day when Annie would no longer care about my opinions. no longer try to please me, and even exploit my mother's predicament for her own benefit.


This wasn't the Annie I knew. She had changed, becoming unfamiliar and formidable. And this transformation made me feel threatened and uneasy in a way I had never experienced before.
###Chapter 152: The Thompson Family Sticks Together
Howard's POV

The restaurant was quiet and intimate, juist as I had expected when making the reservation. Annie and I had just ordered several dishes when I noticed Susan approaching our table.

"Mr. Thompson, do you mind if I report on some work matters first?"Susan asked, her expression professional yet carrying that subtle hint of excitement I'd come to recognize when she had promising news.

I gestured for her to take a seat across from us, simultaneously catching the waiter's attention to order an additional appetizer for Susan.She settled into the chair, straightening her back as she always did before delivering important information.

"Neighboring countries have taken notice of how well our merchandise is selling." Susan began, opening her tablet to display a series of charts. "They all want to acquire publishing rights for the comics, and they're offering quite favorable profit-sharing ratios." Her eyes brightened as she scrolled through the data. "My thought is that we could grant them publishing rights. What do you think?"


"Proceed with it," I nodded in agreement, my decision made after a quick mental calculation of the potential benefits versus any possible drawbacks.The international exposure would only strengthen Annie's brand, and the profit margins looked promising.

With my approval secured, Susan immediately began contacting the potential partners to confirm collaboration details. The representatives from various countries all expressed an urgent desire to finalize agreements quickly, clearly afraid of missing the current momentum.I watched with quiet satisfaction as Susan efficiently navigated these negotiations, her years of experience evident in how smoothly she handled each conversation.


After completing these calls. Susan turned toward Annie, her expression softening slightly. "Though the comics haven't been officially published yet.the pre-order data is already quite remarkable."

Annie's face registered surprise, her eyebrows rising slightly. "Oh?"

"Pre-order means selling before printing," Susan explained patiently,recognizing Annie's unfamiliarity with publishing terminology. "The current sales have already broken the publisher's records, far exceeding their projected targets." Susan's voice carried genuine excitement as she continued. "The publisher is thrilled and is increasing their print run while hoping to continue publishing subsequent content. They're even discussing promotional activities to create even higher sales records.Your comic is undoubtedly this year's dark horse."

I observed Annie's face carefully, noting the spark of excitement dancing in her eyes. "Are there really that many people buying it?" she asked, her voice carrying a hint of disbelief that was endearing to hear.

"Yes," Susan confirmed with a definitive nod. "Your comic is even more popular than anticipated. Add to that the news about your former mother-in-law, and sales are likely to increase further."

Susan's phone chimed, and after checking the message, she looked up with a smile. "The publisher just sent another message-they need to increase the print run again." She continued her explanation. her hands moving animatedly as she spoke."The comics are priced affordably, so sales will be higher than other products. I expect Sarah and her friends will continue creating buzz,and with our own marketing efforts plus international sales, future numbers will be even more impressive."

Annie smiled. a tentative hope visible in her expression. "So I can expect some income?"


Just then. Annie's phone received a bank notification. She glanced at it casually at first. then visibly froze, her eyes widening with shock. I knew exactly what she was seeing-a substantial deposit, farexceeding what an average white-collar professional might earn monthly.

Susan smiled. clearly enjoying Annie's reaction. "How does it feel? Better than working for someone else, right?"

"Yes." Annie responded. her voice carrying undisguised shock. "I... I had no idea it would be this much."

She looked up, her eyes glistening with a mixture of surprise and gratitude."You know. I've been calculating how many years I'd need to save to help my mother retire comfortably. I thought it might take two or three years..."

"And now?" I asked softly, already knowing the answer but wanting to hear her say it.


A smile spread across Annie's face,genuine and warm. "Now it seems I won't have to wait that long."

Annie turned to me, her eyes filled with gratitude. "Thank you for giving me the opportunity to do what I love. I never imagined drawing could bring me this kind of reward." 
I gently patted her shoulder, my touch lingering slightly longer than necessary. "I merely provided a platform. Annie, your talent and hard work are the real keys here. It's your perseverance and creativity that made all this possible."

I could see Annie understood I was being modest. that I didIn't want her to feel indebted for what I had done. She pressed her lips together, her expression clearly touched. "Even so, I'm the beneficiary."

I reached out and gently caressed her face, my fingers lingering against her soft skin. "Between us. do we really need to be so formal?"

Annie smiled shyly at my touach, her cheeks coloring slightly.

Susan cleared her throat discreetly. "I'm still here. Perhaps you two could show a little restraint."


We exchanged smiles and obligingly moved slightly apart.

"Excuse me for a moment," I said, glancing at my watch and standing up."I need to return a call."


I nodded to Annie and Susan, then walked toward a secluded corridor at the side of the restaurant. Once there, I dialed Selena's number.

"Hi, dear brother," Selena's voice came through, as vibrant as always."What's up?"

"I wanted to ask you," I went straight to the point, "about Betty Baker's recent troubles, what do you know about that?"

The brief silence on the other end confirmed my intuition.

"Oh, that," Selena let out a light laugh. "Mother has been quite interested her in that situation lately."


"Just interested?"I asked, my tone calm but probing.

"Well," she sighed, "I might have helped Mother push things along a tiny bit."


"Push things along." I repeated her choice of words. "What exactly do you
mean by that?"

I heard Selena adjusting her position, imagining her shifting to a more comfortable spot on the luxurious sofa in her apartment.

"Howard. you know about Betty's last visit to Mother, demanding she break up you and Annie, right?" Selena asked directly.

"Of course." I answered, recalling the anger on Mother's face when she told me about it.


"Betty came back," Selena's tone sharpened. "Last week, she visited Mother again and said even more unpleasant things. Mother handled it gracefully on the surface, but I could tell how angry she was."

"So you decided to retaliate." It wasn't a question but a statement.

"You know," she chuckled lightly, though the sound carried a cold edge,"sometimes a little... well-placed guidance can make things develop in interesting ways. Women of Betty's age are easily provoked, especially when it concerns what they consider their impeccable family honor."

I raised an eyebrow, though she couldn't see it. "So you're behind all this?"

"I'm simply protecting our family," she stated firmly. "Betty can disparage Annie all she wants, but I won't allow her to hurt Mother. If she wants to play this game of reputation attacks, she should be prepared for counterattacks."


"Selena..." My tone carried a warning.

"Don't worry, Howard," her voice suddenly softened. "I merely allowed Betty to expose her ugly side herself. All I,did was ensure that this time.her words were recorded, rather than hurting people in private as she's done before."


I remained silent for a moment, contemplating my sister's words.Sometimes Selena's methods concerned me, but her protective instinct toward our family had always been strong.

"Remember. moderation is key," I finally said.

"Of course," she responded lightly. "The results are perfect, aren't they?Betty got her lesson, Philip is in chaos, and Annie... well, Annie got the success and recognition she deserves."

"And Mother?" I prompted.


"Mother could barely stop smiling when she saw the news this morning,"Selena laughed. "She called it 'karmic justice."

I remained silent for a moment, appreciating the weight of her words.Selena had always been clever, knowing how to achieve her goals without crossing too many lines.

"You know," I finally said, "you're quite inscrutable sometimes."

She laughed. "That's why I'm your favorite sister."

"You're my only sister," I pointed out, though I couldn't help but smile. "Details don't matter," she replied easily. "What matters is that Betty should have learned her lesson. Sometimes, Howard, fate needs a little nudge to move in the right direction."


I shook my head, even though she couldn't see me. "You should be more careful about your limits."

"Don't worry, brother," her voice suddenly turned serious. "I always know where the boundaries lie. It's just thát sometimes, fate needs a little nudge to move in the right direction."

After hanging up, I stood by the window for a brief moment of reflection.Selena's actions might have been somewhat excessive, but her motivation was to protect our mother and family reputation. While I didn't approve of her methods, I understood her motives-the Thompson family had always stuck together.
###Chapter 153: Could the Problem Actually B Me?

Philip's POV
I stormed back to my office immediately after the confrontation with Annie and Howard, slamming the door behind me with enough force to rattle the framed certificates on the wall. Collapsing into my leather chair, I loosened my tie with trembling fingers, feeling as if it were choking me.

The video exposing my mother's behavior played on a continuous loop in my mind. Betty Baker, the sophisticated Upper East Side socialite,speaking so callously about Annie, her words dripping with contempt and judgment. And Howard's suggestion-"I recommend you see a therapist"-stunglike a thorn embedded deep in my pride.

I reached for my phone and dialed my mother's number before I could reconsider. She answered almost immediately.

"Philip. it's you." Mother's voice sounded more high-pitched than usual,with an unmistakable edge of agitation.

"Mother, I've just seen what's happening online," I said, struggling to keep my voice steady. "What's going on?"

"Hmph!" She let out a dismissive snort. "I merely spoke the truth. Thato country girl from Boston never understood our rules! How could she possibly be worthy of the Baker family? I was only trying to educate her,but she was completely ungrateful!"

I massaged my temple, feeling a wave of exhaustion wash over me."Mother,are you aware that everyone online is supporting Annie?" A few seconds of silence followed from the other end.

"What?" Betty's voice suddenly became shrill, and I could imagine her perfectly composed face contorting with shock. "How dare they?!Everything I did was for the Baker family's reputation!"

Then, her voice abruptly cracked, dissolving into something close to tears."Philip, all my social invitations have been canceled! Even Mrs. Morgan sent me a message saying I'd better not attend tonight's charity gala! My standing in the Upper East Side has crumbled overnight-a lifetime's reputation destroyed in an instant! You must help me! That Annie must be orchestrating all this behind the scenes!"

The fear and resentment in her voice were palpable, almost tangible. "I will never forgive her! Never!"

"I'll handle it, Mother," I responded mechanically,though I had absolutely no idea how to manage this storm.

After hanging up, I slumped in my chair, staring at the financial reports spread across my deskthat suddenly seemed entirely meaningless. The image of Annie walking away hand-in-hand with Howard, completely unfazed by my threats, kept flashing through my mind.

Could the problem actually be me? This question refused to leave my thoughts until I finally picked up my phone and searched for a highly-rated psychological counseling center.

I arrived twenty minutes before my scheduled appointment, surprising even myself with this sense of urgency. The waiting room was tastefully decorated in minimalist style, with abstract art adorning the walls-clearly designed to soothe anxious patients. I was the only one waiting, my knee bouncing nervously. The receptionist eventually led me into Dr. Matthews' office-a space much smaller than I had anticipated, with one wall lined with bookshelves and another featuring large windows overlooking the city skyline. Dr.Matthews was a man in his fifties with salt-and-pepper hair at his temples and thin-framed glasses, sitting at his desk eating lunch.

"Mr. Baker. I wasn't expecting you quite so early," he said,clearly surprised by my presence.


"I know," I stood awkwardly in the doorway. "If you need to finish your lunch. I can wait outside."

"No, please come in," he gestured to a leather chair opposite his desk. "I just wasn't expecting you so soon."

I watched him glance between me and his lunch, obviously caught in an uncomfortable situation. "I just needed to confirm whether there's actually something wrong with me, so I had to see you, to make sure."

Dr. Matthews looked at his lunch, his expression conflicted. "Would you mind if I finish eating first?"


"Please do," I nodded, somewhat relieved at the temporary reprieve from explaining my situation.


Several minutes later, once his food container was empty, he set it aside,picked up a notepad, and focused his full attention on me. "So, what do you believe is your problem?"


The directness of the question caught me off guard. "I believe I love Annie,"I said, the words feeling foreign on my tongue, "but no one around me agrees with that. Not even Annie herself can feel my affection for her."

Dr. Matthews made no comment but pulled out a set of assessment forms from his desk. "Before we discuss further,could you fill out these questionnaires? They'll help me better understand your situation."

For the next twenty minutes, I answered numerous questions about my interpersonal relationships, emotional responses, and behaviors. Many questions made me uncomfortable, forcing me to confront aspects of my interactions with Annie and Sarah that I had never carefully examined before.


When I finished, Dr. Matthews carefully reviewed my answers,then looked up at me. "Mr. Baker, your situation doesn't necessarily constitute a psychological disorder. It seems more like a cognitive bias in your approach to relationships."

"What do you mean?" I frowned.

"Based on your responses," he continued cautiously, "you appear to be someone who places great importance on self-image. Sarah was once your first love-what people often call a 'white moonlight'-and she remains your friend. You very much want to prove to her that you're doing well,that her decision to leave you was a mistake, which is why you're particularly generous around her."


His words touched an uncomfortable chord deep within me.

"This behavior isn't love in the traditional sense; it's more accurately a.combination of unresolved emotions and competitive desire." He adjusted his glasses. "As for Annie, she supported you on your journey from having nothing to your current success. You became accustomed to her frugality, and even when your financial situation improved, your thinking remained fixated on how Sarah rejected you for your lack of money.This unconsciously created a desire to tightly control finances." "You assumed Anmnie would continue to love you and stay with you regardless. This suggests that what you felt before your divorce wasn't love.but dependence on her contributions." Dr. Matthews looked directly at me.

"Generally. when people achieve success, they typically want their spouse to enjoy the improved lifestyle together. Your financial stinginess with Annie suggests a lack of genuine feeling."

His words hit me like a physical blow. I had never considered my behavior from this perspective. "What about after the divorce?" I asked,my voice sounding strained.


"Are you willing to spend money on Annie now?" Dr. Matthews didn't answer directly but posed another question.

The question caught me unprepared. I found myself genuinely thinking:how much would I be willing to give her? What amount feels appropriate?The fact that I was calculating rather than responding emotionally seemed telling in itself.


"You feel pain seeing her with Howard," Dr. Matthews pointed out, "how does that compare to how you felt about marrying Sarah? Which situation causes you greater emotional distress?"

I suddenly realized I had never compared these scenarios.

"When you honestly answer these questions,you need to determine if your desire for reconciliation with Annie stems from genuine love, or merely resentment at seeing her flourish without you." Dr. Matthews leaned forward slightly, "Or perhaps you simply miss the comfort her care provided, but are only willing to value that care at a housekeeper's salary.Theextra money, you'd rather keep entirely for yourself." 
"Once you answer these questions honestly. you'll understand your true feelings for Annie, without needing me to tell you."

"Thank you." I said quietly, rising to leave, my mind already beginning to process the implications of everything he had said.

The conversation with Dr. Matthews clarified one thing: I didn't actually love Sarah.


But what about Annie?

If what the psychologist implied was true, then I had never truly loved Annie-I had only valued her for what she could do for me. This realization was disturbing, forcing me to reconsider what kind of person I was.


I picked up my phone and scrolled to Annie's contact. My thumb hovered over her name for a long moment before I set the phone down again.What could I possibly say to her? That I might have been wrong about my own feelings all along? That Howard's assessment of me was potentially accurate?
###Chapter 154: Look at Me

Annie's POV

After lunch, we returned to Howard's office. I settled comfortably on the leather sofa and took out my phone, curious to check my bank account balance. When the numbers appeared on the screen. I froze-over one million dollars. Just a month ago, this account had held only a few thousand.


"One million..." I whispered to myself, the words feeling foreign on my tongue.


I stared at the screen, trying to process this reality. International publishing rights, animation adaptations, merchandise sales-everything had happened so quickly, like a wwhirlwind that had swept me up and carried me to heights I'd never imagined possible. I lifted my gaze toward Howard, who was working at his desk, his brow furrowed in concentration as he reviewed documents. All of this was because of the opportunity he had given me, along with Susan's expertise and the entire team's efforts.

Howard must have sensed my gaze, because he looked up from his work.Our eyes met across the room, and the corner of his mouth curved into that subtle smile I'd grown to cherish. He set down his pen and walked over, the subtle scent of his cologne preceding him.

"What are you thinking about?" he asked, his voice carrying that gentle tone he reserved just for me.


"I just checked my account," I replied, still somewhat dazed. "I never imagined I could earn this much."

Howard sat beside me, the leather couch dipping slightly under his weight. His thigh pressed lightly against mine, that simple contact now so familiar yet still thrilling.

"You deserve all of it" he said with conviction, his gray eyes holding mine steadily.


"It's because you gave me the chance," Lresponded, feeling a rush of gratitude. "And Susan, and the whole team-their help has been invaluable."


"I merely provided a platform." Howard replied, gently brushing a strand of hair from my face."Your talent and hard work are what truly made this possible."


I smiled, reaching for my laptop that I'd set on the coffee table. I opened it and navigated to my latest comics. "Would you like to see the progress? I've been drawing every day."

Howard leaned closer as I turned the screen toward him. His expression grew serious as he browsed through the panels, his brows knitting together in concentration. His intensity made me suddenly nervous.

"Is something wrong? You don't like it?" I asked, anxiety creeping into my voice.


"No, quite the opposite-it's excellent," he explained, his gaze still fixed on the screen. "I'm just thinking about our release strategy. Once the first volume is complete, we'll launch both the animation and print publication simultaneously."

He turned to face me, his expression shifting to one of business-like determination. "The company will arrange a major promotional campaign.Our goal is to make your comics the bestseller of the year. I'll have Susanhandle the follow-up work."

His finger traced the edge of my laptop absently as he continued. "We've started advancing several new projects recently. Though they don't require my constant attention. I still need to oversee them. I might not have as much time to spend with you in the coming weeks."

I nodded. understanding the demands of his position. "That's all right. I'll be busy with work too."

Howard suddenly cupped my face in his hands, the gesture so tender it made my breath catch. "That's why I treasure every minute with you.I feel like I've missed too much already. Now that we're finally together, I want to make up for lost time."

His words warmed something deep inside me. He gazed into my eyes, and I recognized the familiar flame of desire burning within those gray depths.

"Do you remember before lunch?" he whispered in my ear, his breath warm against my skin. "Just hours ago, when you were on top. That feeling was... unforgettable."

I felt heat rush to my cheeks, both from his direct words and from the vivid memory they evoked. His hand slid to my waist, fingers pressing lightly against the fabric of my blouse. I instinctively reached up to touch his chest, feeling the firm muscles beneath his shirt. The memory of how easily he had restrained Philip earlier that day flashed through my mind,making my heart race.

"I want to experience that again," he said,rising from the sofa and moving toward the door.


He turned the lock with deliberate movements, the soft click echoing in the quiet office. Then he turned to face me, loosening his tie but not coming to me immediately. Instead, he walked back to his office chair and sat down.

"Come here," he said softly, his voice carrying an authority that sent shivers down my spine. "I want to watch you on top."

I rose from the sofa and walked toward him, feeling his heated gaze with each step. When I stood before him, he reached out and pulled me onto his lap.


I straddled his thighs, feeling the firm muscles beneath me. His hands settled on my waist, his fingers possessing a strength that brooked no argument. His shirt was half-open, revealing his chest with its defined contours. He looked up at me, his gray eyes darkened with desire, waiting for me to make the next move.

I leaned down to kiss him. His lips were both soft and firm, tasting faintly of coffee. His hands roamed my back, caressing every inch with gentle precision. I thought of how he had appeared when confronting Philip just hours ago-cold,authoritative, commanding-and how different he was now, vulnerable and passionate for me alone.

Our kiss deepened, growing more urgent. His hands had found their way to my thighs, stroking lightly, sending waves of pleasure through me.

"I want you," I whispered against his lips.

Howard's eyes grew even darker. His fingers worked at the buttons of my blouse, while I helped him remove his shirt completely. His chest was broad and firm, muscles clearly defined, his abdomen a perfect landscape of strength. I marveled at how this powerful body had protected me earlier today,and how now that same power was making me dizzy with desire. "You're beautiful." he murmured, his lips trailing down my neck.

When we finally joined together, the perfect fit of our bodies made me gasp. I began to move, finding the rhythm that suited us both. Howaird's hands remained on my waist, but he allowed me complete control.

"That's it." he encouraged, his voice husky..

I increased my pace, feeling the pleasure building. Howard's breathing grew more rapid, the muscles in his arms tensing. I bent down to kiss him again, our sweat mingling together.

"Look at me," I whispered.

Howard's gaze locked with mine, and in that moment our connection was more than physical. I saw desire in his eyes, but also trust and love. I was no longer the woman who had been hurt by Philip, but someone strong.confident.and loved.


Pleasure began to surge through me, and I felt myself approaching the peak.

"Howard... I'm close..." I breathed.

"I know. Me too... Together," he managed between ragged breaths.

I felt the wave of ecstasy wash over me, clutching Howard's shoulders.tightly as we reached the pinnacle together, our bodies tensing in perfect synchronicity before gradually relaxing against each other.
###Chapter 155: That's What Friends Are For

Catherine's POV

Finally done! I collapsed into my chair, lowering the backrest, and let out a deep sigh. This critical project had consumed our team for a full three weeks,with overtime becoming our daily routine. But now, everything was settled, and I couldn't wait to properly unwind.

I took out my phone and began scrolling through the trending topics.Wow! Annie Baker's comic sales had skyrocketed? And her former mother-in-law Betty Baker was trending? My eyes widened instantly. The trending topicshowed that Betty Baker had publicly posted, questioning whether her former daughter-in-law "met their family standards," even mentioning that "if she couldn't give the Baker family an intelligent heir, it would be better to end the marriage early." How horrifying!

I quickly scanned through the comments section, finding most people rallying behind Annie and condemning Betty's behavior. Someone even revealed that Betty had deliberately arranged incorrect cutlery to humiliate Annie and seated her in corner positions at important social events. God,this was like a real-life "Evil Mother-in-Law Chronicles"!

What surprised me even more was that Annie's comic sales had surged nearly 300% because of this! I couldn't help feeling happy for her-what a satisfying reversal! It seemed Annie had seized the opportunity of Betty's public relations disaster to successfully market herself. I absolutely had to meet her for coffee to hear how all this happened firsthand. They say Howard personally confronted Philip? There must be so much more gossip behind this!


Speaking of which, Annie must be quite well-off now, right? We could go shopping together on Fifth Avenue; I haven't properly browsed stores in ages. After all. Howard Technologies truly lives up to its reputation as a major company-the bonuses from this project would be enough for me to buy that limited-edition handbag I've been eyeing for months...

"Catherine Morgan!"

I nearly jumped out of my chair. Damn, it was Mr. Richardson's voice! I immediately sat up straight, hurriedly turning off my phone screen. My direct supervisor. Mr. Richardson, was a notorious workaholic who always maintained a stern expression and imposed extremely strict requirements on his subordinates. Though I hadI to admit, he did look somewhat handsome in his suit.

"I'm here!" I quickly responded, nervously arranging the files on my desk.

Mr. Richardson strode over, his sharp eyes seemingly capable of detecting that I'd just been checking gossip news. So nerve-wracking! Thankfully,today's project was already completed; otherwise,he would certainly have given me that disappointed look, which felt worse than direct criticism.

"Someone's looking for you downstairs," he said flatly, his expression unusually less severe than usual.

I looked up in surprise: "Do you know who it is?”

"Someone's looking for you downstairs," he repeated, handing me the
phone.

I took the phone, confused: "Do you know who it is?"

"Don't recognize them," he answered briefly, "looks like a business person."

I hesitated: "So I need to go down?" He simply nodded: "Yes." Then he turned to leave but paused. "By the way,Morgan. good work on the project report." That was probably the highest praise he could offer.

I stood up, wondering who it could be. I hoped it wasn't someone selling insurance.Walking toward the elevator. I caught Molly mouthing "Who is it?" I made an exaggerated "No idea" expression, then secretly gestured "Richardson praised me," causing Molly to look shocked. We silently laughed together, like two children stealing candy.

As the elevator doors opened, my mood was still relatively light. But when I walked into the lobby and saw Bill White standing not far away,my face instantly turned pale. How could this utterly ordinary-looking man be here?


I suddenly remembered Molly's warning during lunch-"I heard Bill's been asking about you; he might come looking for you." My God,I'd completely forgotten abouat this! I silently cursed myself for being so careless.


Without any hesitatíon, I turned around, preparing to return to the elevator. I absolutely couldn't let him get his hooks into me.

"Catherine!" his voice echoed through the hall.

I quickened my pace, wishing I could sprout wings and fly away. I should,never have spoken with him for so long out of politeness when we met at that social event. This man was the epitome of an overconfident guy who always thought himself irresistible.

"I know I made a mistake, but could you give me another chance?" he called out behind me. I continued walking pretending not to hear.

"Catherine! Catherine!" he kept calling my name.

I felt my cheeks burning. This was the lobby of Howard Technologies.filled with my colleagues and professionals from other companies.I absolutely couldn't become the center of office gossip.

After taking a deep breath. I turned around and walked quickly toward Bill.


"Could you please stop making a scene?" I lowered my voice, trying to control my anger.

Bill's eyes immediately brightened: "If I stop making a scene, will you give me a chance to get back together?"

"Get back together?" I couldn't help but scoff, "Were we ever together before?"


Bill looked as if my question had choked him, pausing for a long time before awkwardly admitting: "No."

"Then," I made a dismissive gesture, "how can we get back together if we were never together in the first place?"

"I know I made mistakes before," he said quietly, "I shouldn't have.pursued Grace Brown at the same time..."

"T've been thinking," he continued, "if I hadn't been so impulsive back then,if I had pursued you properly, would things have been completely different?"

"Stop thinking about it," I responded coldly. At this m oment, I finally understood the kind of annoyance Annie must have felt when Philip kept bothering her. "There's no possibility of anything between us."

"Bill..." I said his name with contempt. "Have you run out of money? Are you looking at me as someone with a job who could support you?"

Bill looked extremely shocked, as if I had exposed his secret.

"First of all, my money is earned through my own efforts," I said mercilessly, "I would never spend it on a stranger who has nothing to do with me. You should give up that idea."

"It's not like that!" Bill hastily protested.

"But your father has disowned you, and you have no source of income,"I pointed out sharply, "So, how do you plan to support yourself?"

Bill was speechless, clearly without an answer.

"Are you planning to starve on the street?" I continued questioning.

"Bill, when you had money. I never took advantage of that," I stated firmly,"Now that you're poor, I shouldn't have to pay for you either,right?"

"I hope you understand this and never appear in front of me again. I don't owe you anything."

With that, I turned and left, feeling his gaze still clinging to my back. Once upon a time, Bill had been the darling of our social circle, flaunting his family's wealth everywhere. Now, he had fallen to the point of seeking financial help from others. Life truly was unpredictable.

Back in the office, I collapsed into my chair, taking a deep breath, trying to calm my emotions.Molly immediately slid her chair over, having waited at her workstation for my return: "Who was looking for you? You don't look very happy."

"Bill White." I answered irritably. "Can you believe it? Even after falling so low, instead of looking for a job, he still has time to bother me..."

"And he's not poor enough to go hungry yet," Molly added, raising an eyebrow.


"Exactly!" I nodded in agreement. "If he really had no money for food, a few missed meals would solve that problem, maybe even force him to find a job."


Molly laughed, then lowered her voice: "After work, I'll check out the situation first. If he's waiting at the entrance, you can leave through the underground parking garage."

"And if he's not waiting at the entrance, we'll leave together through the main door."


"Thank you," I said gratefully, blowing her a kiss, "You're so good to me.I love you!"


"You're welcome." Molly smiled in response, "That's what friends are for."

We continued chatting until we suddenly saw Mr. Richardson walking toward us. I quickly pretended to be discussing work, while Molly slid back to her own workstation.

Before she left, I leaned in to whisper: "Let's continue this after work.I want to know more details about Annie and her former mother-in-law.Did you hear? They say Howard personally went to confront Philip! And someone saw them facing off in front of the building!" Molly's eyes sparkled: "Really? I heard Howard even grabbed Philip by the wrist! My God. I need to hear the detailed version! Richardson should change positions and become a security guard-he walks without making any sound!" She glanced at the approaching Richardson and dramatically made a zipping motion across her lips.

Watching Molly hurry back to her position, I couldn't help but laugh inwardly. During my time at Howard

Technologies. I had begun to understand what was truly important-not family background or social status, but genuine friendship and personal independence.

Mr. Richardson approached my desk, his brow slightly furrowed: "Morgan,the project report is complete, but the marketing department says they need some detailed adjustments."

"Of course, Mr. Richardson, I'll handle it right away," I immediately sat up straight, adopting the appearance of someone seriously focused on work.
###Chapter 156: I Must Have Loved You

Sarah's POV

I stormed into my apartment, violently tossing my purse onto the sofa and kicking off my high heels in frustration. Damn Philip! I thought,grinding my teeth. He couldn't even complete one simple task-what a worthless man! My plan had been so perfect: follow him, capture his confrontation with Annie on video, then upload it online for everyone to see the true face of that pretentious country girl from Boston.

"Incompetent bastard!" I slammed my fist against the sofa armrest,my knuckles stinging with pain. What good was that man besides his money?The mere thought of Howard intervening made my entire body tremble with rage. I abruptly stood up, grabbed a magazine from the coffee table and tore it to shreds, watching the paper fragments flutter like snowflakes onto the carpet.


This wasn't enough to quell my anger. I turned and kicked the wall,leaving a shoe print on the pristine surface.

I opened my phone and stared at the video I'd secretly recorded. If this footage were released, it would only attract more fans to Annie."Absolutely not!" I hissed through clenched teeth, deleting the video without hesitation. I would never do anything that might benefit that woman.


I collapsed back onto the sofa, taking a deep breath and forcing myself to calm down. "Annie, you're forcing me to use this tactic," I muttered under my breath. Every time I sent Philip to handle my problems, he ruined everything. Since that approach had failed, I needed a different strategy.I refused to stand by and watch Annie live a better life than mine. I opened my phone and found Robert's number.

The screen showed at least a dozen messages from him, none of which I'd bothered to answer. Now was the perfect time to use him. I couldn't reveal my true intentions outright-that might trigger his resistance.

"Hi, how have you been?" I sent a disingenuous greeting.


As expected. he responded almost instantly: "Sarah? I'm good. How are you? I've been messaging you."

I could almost picture his stupid expression lighting up at seeing my message. Men were so easily manipulated. Howard would eventually respond to me the same way, I thought smugly.

"Sorry, I've been really busy," I continued weaving my lies, "I've been meaning to reply, but I just couldn't find the time."

"It's fine. I'm just happy to hear from you," he replied.

"How's the kid?" I asked, knowing this questionwould touch him.

"Everything's normal, thanks for asking."

I asked a few more questions about his recent life, pretending to be a caring ex-wife. After several exchanges of pleasantries, I felt the moment was right to broach my actual topic: "By the way, I just remembered,something.You recorded a video when you were intimate with Annie,right?"

"What?" His reply was noticeably hesitant.

"Send me the video," I commanded directly.

"You need to tell me what you plan to do with it first then Tu decide whether to give it to you."

I smirked contemptuously, not bothering to pretend anymore: "It's simple.Annie's been making me uncomfortable lately, so I want to upload the video of you two online. When people see Annie fooling around before her divorce was finalized. they'll definitely criticize her."

I could imagine all the wonderful consequences: Annie's carefully built online reputation instantly destroyed, Howard losing interest in her,her comic and merchandise sales plummeting below mine. The thought filled me with such pleasure that I couldn't help but smile.

Nothing in the world was more satisfying than watching someone you despise get dragged down from their pedestal while you soared to new heights.


When he didn't respond for several minutes, I called him directly: "Hello?"


"I don't want to talk to you right now," his voice sounded muffled.

What kind of attitude was this? Since when did he have the courage to disobey me? I frowned.

"Just send me what I want first," I said impatiently.


"Have you considered that after it's released, people will see me too? What will they think of me?" He was actually hesitating.

How troublesome. Men always became cowardly at such moments. Philip was useless, but at least he wasn't so indecisive.

"You have a good physique and stamina. People will only envy you when they see it." I casually reassured him. This kind of fragile male ego always needed sweet talk to appease. 
"But I don't want to do this."

I remained silent, waiting for him to continue. Was he starting to resist me?This was new. I needed to handle this carefully-I couldn't afford to lose such an important pawn.




Seeing he was about to hang up. I quickly added: "I'll blur your face before uploading it."

He gave a bitter laugh, then told me: "I'm sorry to inform you, but Annie and I never had that kind of relationship. Although I did record a video,I guess it's not what you're looking for. I can send it to you if you want.But I can tell you this-if it were released,people would only praise Annie for being... smart."

What?! I nearly threw my phone against the wall. He never slept with Annie? This useless man! I had calculated everything so carefully, only to stumble at this point. I took a deep breath, forcing myself to remain calm.

I heard him opening his computer, and then my phone received a file.Whatever this video contained, it clearly wouldn't serve my purpose.

"I just want to ask you one question..." his voice sounded choked.

I didn't need to open this stupid video,asking lazily: "What?"

"Did you ever love me?"

The question caught me off guard. Still hung up on this? What a pathetic man. I leaned back on the sofa, seriously considering how to answer.Finally, I said: "I must have loved you. Otherwise, with so many wealthy men pursuing me, why would I have chosen to marry you?" The truth, of course, was that he had been richer than my other suitors at that time.


"I understand. Thank you," he said softly.

I hung up without hesitation, throwing my phone onto the sofa. "Useless!They're all useless!" I cursed through gritted teeth, my fists clenched so tightly my knuckles turned white. Philip was useless, botching even a simple confrontation; Robert was even more useless, not even having a damn video! Why was I surrounded by such incompetent men?

I jumped to my feet. pacing back and forth in the living room,my chest heaving violently. I couldn't swallow this anger! Annie Baker, that pretentious Boston woman-why did she get everything? Her comics were bestsellers, she had a man like Howard defending her,and what did I have? I was trapped here, watching my plans fail one after another!

"No, I won't give up," I muttered, my voice trembling with fury. "This isn't over."


I bit my lower lip so hard I tasted blood. I wouldn't fail again. I would devise a foolproof plan. Whatever the cost, I would make Annie disappear completely from Howard's life. This was my promise, and my curse.
###Chapter 157: This Time, I Have the Power to Change Things
Annie's POV

I had just finished updating my comic for the day and was lying on the leather sofa in Howard's office when my phone rang. It was Susan Moore.

After our last event, Susan had asked for my direct contact information,saying she didn't want to go through Howard every time she needed to reach me. I answered the call.


"Annie, hello!" Susan's voice came through the phone. "The publisher just contacted me. They hope you can sign copies of your newly published comic."


"Sign? How many copies need to be signed?" I asked.

"Quite a substantial number," Susan answered. "That's why the publisher suggests you go directly to the printing factory in Queens to complete the signing work. This way, they can immediately pack and ship the signed editions, which would be much more efficient."


"I understand," I nodded, though she couldn't see me.

"So, when would you have time to go?" Susan asked.

I checked the time-I needed to pick up Lucy soon. "Would tomorrow work? Today I need to pick up Lucy."

"Of course, no problem," Susan readily agreed, which was a relief.

Howard had been handling documents and meetings all day,and just now looked up. "Going to the printing factory tomorrow?" "Yes," I nodded, suddenly feeling a twinge of unease. Since moving into Howard's Long Island mansion, we had been practically inseparable. The thought of being apart for a day left me feeling strangely emnpty.

Howard set down his files and came to sit beside me. His hand gently covered mine, the warm touch making my heart beat faster.

"Will youmiss me?" he asked softly, his gray eyes carrying that familiar tender smile.

"It's only one day," I replied casually, but couldn't help leaning closer to him. "Though... maybe I'll miss you a little bit."

Howard put his arm around my shoulders and placed a gentle kisson my forehead. "Just a little bit?"

I laughed and pushed him playfully. "Okay, maybe more than a little."

His fingers lightly caressed my cheek. "Once we both get busy, we might not have time to miss each other."

"You're right," I agreed. "So who will take me tomorrow? Brian's personal driver Mitchell?"


"No," Howard shook his head. "Mitchell is only responsible for Brian's arrangements. I'll have a company car take you."

He lifted my chin, making me look directly into his eyes. "Tomorrow we'll have much less time together, so we should cherish every minute today."

His words sent a warm current through me. I rested gently against his shoulder. "We'll still see each other when we get home tonight."

We soon gathered our things and headed to the Upper East Side Private Preschool to pick up Lucy. Most of the children had already been picked up. In the distance. Lucy spotted us immediately and ran over happily.

"Mom. we're having our spring performance the day after tomorrow! You must come see me perform!" Her blue eyes sparkled with anticipation.This was the first important performance she would participate in since I became her mother.

"Of course, I'll definitely be there," I promised without hesitation, though I was quickly calculating my schedule. Tomorrow I needed to go to the printing factory for signing, the day after was Lucy's performance, plus I had comic updates and new children's book concepts to work on... these next few days would indeed be busy, but I would never miss Lucy's first performance.


Lucy hugged me happily. "I knew Mom wouldn't refuse me!" She then turned to Howard. "Dad must come too!"


Howard looked at her tenderly. "No problem, I'll adjust my schedule."

Lucy nodded with satisfaction. At that moment, I noticed Pennystanding not far away, looking hesitant, as if she wanted to come over but didn't quite dare. She occasionally glanced at Lucy, then bit her lip and looked down,as if something was troubling her.

I smiled at her, and she quickly averted her gaze, pretending to organize her little backpack. What was wrong with this child? Usually so lively,today she seemed unusually reserved. I was about to go over and ask when her mother, Sue Peterson, walked up looking exhausted.

Howard glanced at Sue and took the initiative to say, "You can take a day off to accompany your daughter to the performance." "Really?" Sue asked, surprised.

"Of course," Howard replied calmly. "We work to earn money to provide our children with better lives, don't we? If we're too busy to spend time with them, what's the point of all our efforts?"

His words made me glance at his profile. This man, so decisive and efficient in business, always had his eyes soften when talking about children. I used to think that elites like him always put their careers first,but now I understand that some people's strength lies precisely in knowing what truly matters.

Sue nodded gratefully. "Thank you, Mr. Thompson."

On the way home. Lucy and Pennyexcitedly discussed the upcoming performance in the back seat.

"I've memorized all the poetry I need to recite!" Lucy announced proudly."Ms. Taylor says I have the most precise pronunciation in the class."

"Really? That's wonderful!" Penny applauded. "I'm playing a bunny in the play, and I have to dance and sing."

"Are your bunny ears ready?" Lucy asked.

"Mom made them for me. They're pink with shiny little stars!" Penny described excitedly. "What are you wearing for your recitation?"

"Just my blue dress. Ms. Taylor says it matches my eyes." Lucy turned to me."Mom,what do you think?"

"It suits you perfectly," I smiled, suddenly feeling a wave of happiness wash over me. Listening to their innocent conversation. I couldn't help exchanging a glance with Howard through the rearview mirror. His gaze was also filled with warmth.


After arrivig home,we went for our usual jog with Thomas, then did some basic training in the home gym. As Lucy went upstairs to shower.Penny tugged at the hem of my shirt.

"Auntie, I have something to tell you," she said softly. "It's about Lucy."

I bent down. "What is it.Penny?"


She bit her lip, hesitating for a moment before saying. "Some kids in class have been bullying Lucy lately. I tried to stop them, told them it was wrong, but no one would listen to me." She hung her head,looking guilty,as if she felt bad about not being able to protect her friend.

Hearing this, I immediately crouched down and held her small hands."Penny, you're amazing. You stood up when you saw something unfair happening."


"You're not mad that I couldn't protect Lucy better?" she asked, surprised.

I gently shook my head. "But you're just a little girl yourself."

Penny tilted her head, seeming not to understand my meaning.

"It's completely normal that you didn't know how to handle this situation,"I continued. "But I'm very grateful that you were willing to tell me aboub it. If it weren't for you, I might still not know about the problems Lucy is facing at school."


Penny's eyes brightened, her face showing a relieved smile. Watching her walk away, I stood there, a wave of complex emotions rising in my heart.

Lucy was being bullied... yet she didn't act like someone who was being  at all.

I tooka deep breath to calm myself. Past wounds had taught me that sometimes the most effective protection isn't impulsive confrontation, but a wise response. I needed to first understand the entire situation clearly, to know exactly what was happening, who was bullying her, and why. The first step to solving a problem is to fully understand the problem itself,not to rush in blindly.


This time. I have the power to change things.
###Chapter 158: Sarah Just Called Me

Howard's POV

After dinner, I settled onto the living room sofa, responding to several urgent emails. This afternoon, after Annie and I picked up Lucy from school.we had invited Penny and her mother Sue to stay for dinner. The children had eaten with enthusiasm, and now thley were playing upstairs,their occasional laughter filling the house with vibrant energy.

"Penny!" Lucy's voice drifted down from upstairs, clear and excited. "The bath is ready! You can gofirst!"

"Okay!" Penny responded cheerfully.

A few minutes later, Annie descended the stairs and satbeside me. Her expression was troubled, which immediately caught my attention. The work emails could wait. I set my phone down and.turned toward her.

"Is something wrong?" I asked, noticing the subtle furrow in her brow-typically a sign she was concerned about something.

Annie leaned closer to me, lowering her voice. "Penny just told me something." She paused, ensuring the children couldn't overhear our conversation. "Lucy is being bullied at school."

Her words hit me like ice water. "What?" My voice instinctively deepened."Why hasn't she told us?"

"I don't know," Annie shook her head, "Penny said she tried to help,but as a little girl, there was only so much she could do. She felt guilty about not being able to protect Lucy, which is why she told me."

I drew a deep breath, controlling the anger rising within me."Who would dare bully her? Which child?"

"Penny didn't specify who." Annie answered, her hand gently resting on my arm, seemingly to calm me. "Tll find time to talk with Lucy privately.Before we take any action. I need to understand the complete situation."

I nodded in agreement. Annie always maintained rationality when I became emotional. "You're right. We shouId understand the situation before deciding what to do." Nevertheless, I was already mentally listing several solutions; if necessary. I would utilize every resource at my disposal to ensure Lucy would never be harmed again.

As we were speaking. Sue emerged from the kitchen, appearing somewhat uncomfortable. As an employee of my company, she seemed ill at ease in the private setting of my home.

"Mr. Thompson, if you have a moment, I'd like to ask you a few questions about the new project," she said, her voice betraying a hint of nervousness.
"I have some new ideas about optimizing our market strategy..."


I glanced at Annie, who nodded slightly, indicating her understanding.

"Of course," I said to Sue, gesturing for her to take a seat on the opposite side of the living room. "Briefly share your thoughts."

Sue immediately began enthusiastically explaining her concept: "We could expand our target demographic to include young professionals aged 25-35,who are more willing to invest in tech products. I've done some preliminary research, and this group is particularly interested in our smart home systems, especially those integrated with AI assistants."

She continued, outlining a cross-platform marketing plan that included social media, industry exhibitions, and collaborations with lifestyle bloggers. I noticed that while her thinking was creative, it lacked maturity in execution details. and some budget estimates were overly optimistic.

When she finally paused for my feedback, I said, "Your direction is good.particularly the targeting of young professionals is quite accurate.However,the market penetration strategy needs to be more gradual,and the budget allocation requires reassessment. If you don't mind, it would be best to note this down so we can discuss it in more detail tomorrow."

Sue nodded. then suddenly realized she hadn't brought her work notebook.She glanced around, visibly embarrassed: "I didn't expect to discuss work details here, so I didn't bring my notebook..."

Annie.perceptive as always, noticed her predicament and reachedfor her own notebook and pen from the coffee table. "Here,use this."

"Thank you. Annie," Sue accepted gratefully.

While I briefly outlined a few suggestions, Annie said softly, "I'll go check on the children and continue working on my comic. I need to finish some work before tomorrow's signing at theprinting factory."

I nodded in understanding. Since checking her account balance in my office yesterday, Annie seemed more invested in her work and more confident. Watching her ascend the stairs, I couldn't help feeling proud of her achievements.


My discussion with Sue didn't last long. By the time we finished, Lucy and Penny had completed their baths and came running downstairs in their pajamas.

"Dad!" Lucy ran toward me, her blue eyes sparkling with excitement."You and Mom absolutely must come see my performance! I've memorized all the poetry!"

"Of course we will," I crouched down to meet her at eye level, gently stroking her golden hair. "I've already rearranged all my meetings.1wouldn't miss it for anything."

"Really?" Lucy's eyes instantly brightened, "Mom said she'd come too!"

"Yes, we'll both be there. This is your important moment, and we wouldn't miss it." I promised.

The children excitedly ran back upstairs to continue their games. Sue sat on the sofa, looking much more relaxed than when she'd arrived. Just then,my phone rang-it was Robert.

Since asking Robert to impersonate me using a newly created private account to communicate with Sarah, he rarely contacted me directly unless something important had happened. I walked to the end of the hallway,ensuring privacy before answering.

"Robert, what's the matter?" My voice remained calm, but internally I was already on alert.

"Howard," his voice sounded tense and hesitant, noticeably different from usual. "Sarah... Sarah just called me."

"What did she say?" I asked, the calmness in my tone masking my inner unease.

"She asked me to... she asked me to kidnap Lucy," Robert's voice was almost a whisper, filled with obvious shock and guilt. "She said she had planned everything."

My blood instantly froze. "What?" My voice dangerously lowered,barely controlling my anger.

"Her plan was to use Lucy as bait to lure out Annie," Robert continued. "Then... then force Annie to have relations with me and record it. She wants to use that video to destroy Annie."


I gripped my phone with such force I nearly crushed it. A cold fury climbed up my spine, but I forced myself to remain calm: "Is that so?When did she call you?"


"Just now." Robert answered. "I called you immediately after hearing her out. I never imagined she would go this far... This isn't revenge anymore;this is criminal."


"You refused her, right?" I asked, my voice terrifyingly calm as I had already begun formulating a response strategy in my mind.
###Chapter 159: I Hope You Live Well Without Me

Sarah's POV

I sprawled across my designer sofa, swirling a glass of expensive cabernet while glaring at my laptop screen. The website displayed Annie Baker's comic sales figures, which had skyrocketed another 10%. The sight made my stomach churn with disgust. That country girl from Boston was becoming a genuine cultural phenomenon-all because of Howard Thompson's connections and resources.

The same resources that should have been mine.

"This should never have happened," I muttered, slamming my laptop shut.

I'd already tried several approaches to destroy Annie. I'd manipulated Phlip into confronting her, hoping to create a scene that would damage her reputation. I'd orchestrated negative comments about her on social media, using fake accounts and influencing my circle of friends to join in.And yet, somehow. that unassuming illustrator had emerged from every attack even more beloved by the public.

It was infuriating. Unbearable.

My fingers hovered over my phone, remembering that Robert had sent meo a video from his encounter with Annie. He'd claimed nothing significant happened between them, but I refused to believe it. Men always downplayedtheir failures. I needed to see exactly what had transpired,to determine if there was anything salvageable for my purposes.

I retrieved my tablet and opened the video file, holding my breath as the footage began to play. The scene showed Robert's photography studio, 
cluttered with old equipment and empty whiskey bottles-a pathetic shadow of the glamorous space he'd once maintained when we were married.


My pulse quickened as I watched Robert approach Annie, who was sitting on a folding bed. He suddenly grabbed her wrists, pushing her against the wall.Yes,exactly what I wanted! My heartbeat accelerated with anticipation,waiting for what would inevitably follow.

But instead of continuation, the footage took an unexpected turn. Annie's voice cut through clearly: "Robert, what are you doing? This isn't the wway to solve your problems."

My jaw clenched. She sounded infuriatingly coherent, not at all like someone under the influence of the sedative Philip was supposed to have administered.


Even more enraging, Robert released her and stepped back, his posture crumbling like the coward he truly was. Annie didn't run or scream as any normal person would after such an encounter. Instead, she began talking to hím about "principles" and "making the right choices."

"You have a son who needs his father to be better than this," Annie's voice was gentle but firm. "Is this the example you want to set for Max?"

The mention of my son's name from her lips made my blood boil.How dare she invoke Max? Who was she to lecture anyone about parenting when she couldn't even keep her own child?

The video became chaotic after that-shouting, the sound of a door crashing open, violent movement as the camera apparently fell to the floor.The final frames showed a blur of motion before cutting to black. "Useless!" I hissed, flinging the tablet onto the adjacent cushion.I'd invested considerable effort planning this strategy-tracking Annie's schedule. manipulating Philip, coordinating with Robert-and this pathetic excuse for a man had faltered at the crucial moment!

I grabbed my crystal wine glass and slammed it onto the coffee table,the dark liquid sloshing dangerously close to the rim. Taking a deep breath, I forced myself to think rationally. Robert had failed me, but that didn't mean I should abandon my objective. Perhaps a more direct approach was needed.


I reached for my phone and dialed Robert's number, drumming my perfectly manicured nails against the armrest while waiting for him to answer.


"Yes?" His voice was unexpectedly calm when he finally picked up.

His casual tone ignited my fury. After his spectacular failure, he should have been apologetic, desperate for my forgiveness.

"You've completely disappointed me, Robert." I kept my voice low and controlled.though internally I was seething. "I watched the video you sent.You did absolutely nothing!"

Silence greeted me from the other end.

"I gave you a perfect opportunity toruin Annie, and you let her go." My voice trembled slightly with suppressed rage. "Do you realize how stupid that was?"


"What happened that day was complicated," Robert finally responded,his voice oddly steady. "I couldn't do what you asked."

I inhaled deeply, reining in my emotions. Losing control weulantsemy purposes now. I needed to maintain leverage.

"I'm giving you two options," I paused deliberately, letting the tension build. "Either you kidnap Howard Thompson's daughter Lucy to lure Annie, then have your way with her..."

"Or," I continued coldly, "we never speak again."

"What's the price?" Robert asked after a moment.

"If you're willing to do this for me, I'll continue our relationship."I softened my tone, adopting the seductive purr that had always worked on him before. "If you refuse, we're completely finished."

A small. satisfied smile curled my lips as I elegantly adjusted my posture,waiting for his inevitable agreement. Robert couldn't possibly refuse me-he never had. I knew him too well, understood his pathological attachment to me, knew exactly what he was willing to do for even the smallest hint of my approval.

How many times had he dropped everything at my call? How many times had he eagerly fulfilled my most casual requests? Like a well-trained dog,accustomed to my commands and craving my validation.

To maintain our connection, he would have no choice. This was the taste of power-holding the phone, I could almost feel his struggle and eventual submission through the line. I was already contemplating the next steps:once he agreed, how would I arrange the details of ths plan?

The silence stretched for several seconds before I heard him take a deep breath.

"Then..." his voice was strangely composed, "I hope you live well without me." For a moment. I thrught I'd misheard. What? Say thaagain?

I cannot hunt another woman for you." Robert enunciatedI each word clearly


This man,who had once done everything Iasked without question,was refusing me? Impossible.

"Robert!" I clenched my teeth. digging my nails into the sofa cushion."Your family is bankrupt! You don't have a penny to your name.My willingness to maintain contact with you is a favor! Don't be ungrateful!"

"Don't waste any more time doing me favors. It's better for you this way too." His voice carried a finality I'd never heard before.

"You useless thing!" I nearly screamed, losing my carefully maintained composure. "You can't even do this one small thing,Robert..."

Before I could continue berating him, the line went dead. He had hung up on me!


I stared at the phone screen in disbelief before hurling it violently at the floor. The device shattered instantly, components scattering across my imported marble tiles.


I collapsed back onto the sofa, my eyes fixed on the broken pieces of my phone,my chest heaving with fury.


Philip had money, and I'd pursued him for his wealth, so his eventual dismissal was somewhat understandable. Howard's position was untouchable, making his disregard predictable. But Robert? He had once loved me so completely, had done anything for me! Now he dared to refuse me too? What right did he have? This can't be it. I was losing control. Not just of my plans, but of the men I'd once manipulated with such ease. It was intolerable.

I stood up abruptly, pacing the length of my living room. If Robert wouldn'
t help me, who would? There had to be someone else I could use.
###Chapter 160: Everything Seems Less Seriou
Howard's POV

Robert's revelation froze the blood in my veins. Sarah planning to kidnap Lucy? Using an innocent child as bait to ensnare Annie? My vision momentarily darkened at the edges, a cold,calculating rage replacing my usual composed demeanor. This wasn't just crossing a line; this was declaring war against everything I held sacred.

"Is that so? When did she call you?" I kept my voice steady, though my knuckles had turned white from gripping the phone.

"Just now," Robert answered, urgency evident in his tone. "I called you immediately after hearing her out. I never imagined she would go this far...This isn't revenge anymore; this is criminal."


"You refused her, right?" I asked through clenched teeth, struggling to control the anger in my voice.

"Of course I refused," Robert quickly responded. "Actually, this isn't the first time she's asked me to cause trouble for Annie. Previously, she wanted me to provide a video of Annie and me being intimate, but we never had that kind of relationship."


I listened silently, my mind racing. Robert choosing to inform me rather than help Sarah was unexpected. The Robert I remembered hadn't struck me as particularly principled.

"I'm curious," I said slowly, my tone losing some of its edge, "why did you choose to tell me this?"


There was a moment of silence on the other end. "There are several
reasons." Robert finally replied, with unusual sincerity in his voice."Annie once gave me some advice when I was at my most confused...She helped me understand the importance of having boundaries. Her wisdom might have saved me, and I owe her for that."

I nodded slightly, even though he couldn'tsee me. That sounded exactly like something Annie would do. "What else?" I prompted.

"Recently, I've been questioning whether Sarah ever truly loved me," he sighed softly. "Watching her go to such lengths for revenge, I've realized I may never have truly known her at all."

Hearing Robert's words, I clenched my fist, feeling the muscles in my arm tighten. The thought of Sarah planning to harm Lucy ignited a fury in my chest unlike anything I'd felt before. No one, absolutely no one, was allowed to threaten my family. Both Lucy and Annie were the most important people in my life.

"I'll handle this," my voice had dropped so low it resembled the air before a thunderstorm. "Thank you for telling me."

I took a deep breath, considering my next move. Sarah had evolved from an annoying nuisance to a genuine threat. I needed a plan that would resolve the issue permanently, rather than merely reacting to each of her attacks.


An idea began forming in my mind, and I changed the subject: "By the way,how is your new company doing?"

Robert seemed caught off guard by the shift in topic, answering somewhat awkwardly, "We've encountered some issues, but I'm managing."

I thoughtfully tapped the desk: "Sounds like progress isn't meeting expectations. I thought I would have received more updatesby now." This wasn't merely small talk; I was already formulating a plan.

"I figured I could handle many things independently," Robert explained.hesitation evident in his voice.

"Some things do require facing alone," I agreed,then moved directly to the point, "but I believe collaboration is more efficient. Come to my company tomorrow. I have some ideas I'd like to discuss with you in detail."

"Alright," Robert replied, surprise coloring his tone.

After hanging up, I stood by the window, gazing at the Long Island landscape shrouded in darkness, my thoughts churning. Sarah's actions weren't just a personal vendetta against Annie anymore; she was now threatening Lucy-an innocent child. My instinct was to tell Annie immediately, but I quickly reconsidered.

Annie already had enough on her plate: dealingwith Lucy being bullied at school, the book signing at the printing factory tomorrow, Lucy's school performance the day after... all while just beginning to enjoy her professional success. I couldn't add to her burden. This problem. I would solve myself.

Taking a deep breath, I realized I needed to set these concerns aside temporarily. Right now, the most important thing was not letting Annie,detect anything unusual. I didn't want these negative emotions to affect our precious time together. I gently knocked on Annie's door.

The door opened quickly, revealing Annie with a gentle smile on her face."Finished talking?" she asked, showing mild curiosity.

Looking at her attentive expression, the tension I'd been feeling gradually gave way to a sense of ease. I nodded. suddenly thinking of a topic that might shift my focus. "I just noticed something-you left me alone with another woman?" I deliberately adopted a teasing tone, hoping to completely change the mood.

Annie tilted her head, looking confused: "Both of you only have work on your minds. Even together, you'd only discuss business matters.I'm confident nothing would happen between you two.Is that a problem?"

I observed her composed expression, feeling my unease grow more pronounced. "Even if you're certain we're both trustworthy,you should be more cautious. Otherwise..." I paused, "if we did something inappropriate,what would you do?"

Annie merely blinked several times, seemingly contemplating the meaning behind my question.

I placed both hands on her shoulders, speaking earnestly: "I want you to be jealous. It would prove that you love me."

I knew this sounded somewhat childish, especially after dealing with such serious matters moments ago, but with Annie, I always seemed able to reconnect with simpler emotions.

Annie's lips curved slightly upward as she wrapped her arms around my waist, her voice softening: "Does not being jealous mean I don't love you?I don't think so, Howard. In my view, the best relationship is one where we understand what each other wants and can trust one another."


"But isn't love about jealousy and possession?" I asked, confused.In my limited experience with relationships, I had assumed those were natural expressions of love. What others call love is ultimately their own." Annie calmly replied."Their relationships may have certain instabilities that trigger possessiveness and jealousy. But that's never been the case between us.That being the case, why should we follow the paths others have taken?"

She gazed at me. her bright eyes showing not a trace of doubt, only pure trust and affection. I had never considered that love could be so simple and pure.

In that moment, all concerns about Sarah were temporarily set aside. I chuckled softly and said. "You're right. How we choose to live depends on the two of us. Even if it doesn't conform to public perception, it doesn't matter as long as we're comfortable. What's important is that we're happy,right?"

Annie nodded in response: "Yes, I believe the primary task for two people together is to discover what our true inner needs are. As long as our partner can fulfill those needs. it's enough."

Her wisdom and understanding never failed to surprise me. I couldn't help but cup her face in my hands, giving her a tender kiss. As the kiss deepened, a powerful longing rose within me. Annie would be going to the signing tomorrow, and we might not see each other for the entire day.In this moment, I only wanted to hold her close, to bridge our impending separation through physical intimacy...

Just as I was about to suggest this, Annie gently patted my back, bringing me back to reality: "We still have guests downstairs."

I released her with some reluctance, nodding: "Let's go down together."Taking her hand, I felt the warmth of her fingertips. Though Sarah's threat still lingered in my mind, with Annie by my side,everything seemed less serious.
###Chapter 161: Our Lucy Has Really Grown Up

Annie's POV
I stood on the porch with Howard, waving goodbye to Sue. Penny,and Thomas. Thomas wasn't just Lucy's gymnastics coach anymore; he'd also taken on the role of Sue's bodyguard. I noticed when he helped Sue into the car, their fingers briefly touched, and Sue's cheeks flushed with a soft pink hue. Interesting. I thought to myself, there seemed to be some sparks between them.

"Sue, remember to bring Penny to school early tomorrow for rehearsal!" I called out gently.

Sue nodded with a smile. "Of course, I've already adjusted my work schedule. Thank you both for your hospitality tonight."

"You're welcome. Feel free to visit anytime," Howard responded politely,his hand resting naturally against the small of my back.

Thomas opened the car door, escorting Sue and Penny inside before taking his place in the driver's seat. The car pulled away slowly, disappearing into the night.


We turned and went back inside, closing the front door behind us. Lucy was already standing at the foot of the stairs in her pink pajamas, waiting for us.


"Finally done with the guests!" she exclaimed cheerfully, her little face beaming with anticipation. She grabbed my hand, skipping happily.′′Mom,can you sleep with me tonight?"

I glanced at Howard, remembering what Penny had revealed earlier about Lucy being bullied at school. This would be the perfect opportunity to speak with her privately. Without hesitation. I replied. "Of course.sweetheart."

Howard walked behind us, deliberately slowing his pace. an exaggerated look of disappointment crossing his features. "What about me? No invitation?" His tone carried an obvious note of teasing. but I could hear the tenderness beneath it.

Lucy stopped and turned, looking confused. "Does Dad want to sleep with us too?" She looked Howard up and down, then glanced at her small bed,giggling. "But Dad, my bed is too small for three people! Unless you want to sleep on the floor."

Howard laughed. ruffling Lucy's golden hair. "I'm just kidding, princess.You and Mom have a good chat. I still have some work to finish." He winked at me. and I knew he was giving Lucy anad me space to be alone.

"Where's my goodnight kiss?" Lucy tilted her face up expectantly toward Howard.


Howard bent down and placed a gentle kiss on Lucy's forehead."Goodnight, my little princess." Then he straightened up and left a kiss on my cheek as well. "Don't stay up too late," he whispered to me before heading toward his study.


Lucy tugged at my hand, eagerly leading me to her room. Her bedroom was decorated with beautiful fairy tale themed wallpaper, with several small illustrations I'd drawn for her hanging on the walls. Since we'd both already showered, she climbed directly into bed, patting the space beside her."Mom,come on!"

I lay down beside her, the covers filled with the faint scent of children's shampoo. Lucy immediately snuggled close, draping one arm across my waist and one leg over mine, clinging to me like a little koala.

"Is there anything special you'd like to talk about tonight?" I asked softly.running my fingers through her soft golden hair.

Lucy remained silent for a moment. as if gathering her thoughts."Mom,I have a question I want to ask you."

"What is it,sweetheart?"

She lifted her head, her big blue eyes looking directly into mine. "I don't know why. but when I see you and Dad getting along so well. I feel a little uncomfortable." She paused for a moment. "But what's strange is that deep down. I also want you two to have a good relationship. I'm confused about what I'm feeling."

Her question caught me by surprise. I'd been prepared to discuss the bullying at school, already thinking about how to advise her. But this was what was truly troubling her.


I gently rubbed her back, thinking about how to respond. "Perhaps it's because before your father andI became close, you felt that our attention was focused entirely on you?"

Lucy furrowed her small brow, seriously considering this possibility.


I continued explaining, "But after we became close,you might feel that we're paying too much attention to each other and not enough to you? This makes you feel somewhat neglected,doesn't it?"

Lucy's eyes brightened, and she nodded eagerly. "Yes,that's exactly it!How did you know,Mom?"I smiled and hugged her tighter. "Because many children feel this way.But no matter how the relationship between your father and me changes.one thing will never change-that is our love for you. Can you feel that love?"

"Of course!" Lucy answered without hesitation. "Dad always plays with me.and you tell me stories every day." She smiled shyly. "I guess I shouldn't feel uneasy about this,right?"

"Your feelings are always valid, and you don't need to apologize for them,"I kissed the top of her head gently. "But remember, in a family, love isn't like a cake that gets smaller when divided-it's like stars-the more there are, the brighter it gets."

Lucy's face lit up with understanding. "Mom, you're so smart! I always thought that if you loved Dad, you might love me a little less. But that's not how it works,is it?"


"Not at all," I confirmed with a smile.

Lucy sighed contentedly, then suddenly laughed. "Mom, you're right.When you have problems, you should ask adults for help. Otherwise,if I just think about it myself, I might worry for a long time."

"You can always come to me with any questions in the future," I promised."I will always listen, and everything I know, I'll tell you without holding anything back."


"Okay," Lucy nodded, then added, "but I don't have any other questions now."

She looked so innocent, and yet I knew there was another issue we needed to discuss. I hesitated for a moment before asking softly,"Lucy, I heard someone's been bullying you at school. Is that true?"

Lucy's body neticeably stiffened. She didn't answer immediately,instead asking. "It wasn't the teacher who told you, wasit?"

I wasn't sure how to respond but decided to remain honest.′′fI'm not mistaken. was it Penny who told you?"

I nodded. "Yes. it was."

Lucy sighed in relief. "I thought so." She didn't seem angry or upset, but calmly admitted. "It's true, there are a few children who say mean things.But you know what? Since I started working out with Thomas, my physical condition has improved a lot, and I can handle these things myself now."

"How do you handle it?" I asked curiously.

"It's simple." Lucy said confidently. "If they talk about me, I talk back. If they insult me, I give it right back, word for word. And if they try to push or hit me?" She shrugged. "They can't beat me anyway."

I couldn't help but laugh, feeling proud of her courage yet pained that she had to face such challenges at such a young age. "Our Lucy is really amazing.Soyoung and already so strong."

"It's nothing." Lucy smiled shyly. "I've already solved these problems myself, so I didn't think it was necessary to tell you and Dad. But I definitely wasn't trying to hide it from you."

I hugged her. "I understand. But promise me, if things ever get out of your control,you'll tell us,okay?"

"I promise," Lucy nodded seriously. Another question occurred to me. "Does it bother you that Penny told me about this?"

Lucy shook her head without hesitation. "Of course not. If the same thing happened to Penny, I would make the same choice she did. Because we both genuinely want what's best for each other."

I felt a warmth spreading through my chest. Lucy's answer showed a maturity and empathy far beyond her years. I cupped her small face in my hands and kissed her forehead tenderly. "Our Lucy has really grown up."

"Really?" she asked shyly.

"Yes, absolutely," I affirmed.

Lucy smiled happily. then yawned. We chatted a little longer, and gradually her eyelids grew heavy until she finally fell asleep peacefully, her small hand still clutching my nightgown.

I gently brushed the golden hair from her forehead, studying her sleeping face in the dim light of the bedside lamp. Since I first came to this home,her features hadn't changed much, but she as a person had transformed completely. The once introverted, silent, sometimes unapproachable little girl had become confident, cheerful, her face constantly radiating happiness.

Looking at her steady breathing and rosy cheeks, my heart filled with an unprecedented sense of fulfillment. I never imagined I would have such an intelligent, brave, and kind daughter. Although we shared no blood relation, at this moment I felt that our connection was deeper than any biological bond.


I softly kissed her cheek. Watching Lucy's peaceful sleeping face,I decided to keep my promise and stay by her side tonight.

Tomorrow would bring many busy activities waiting for us.
###Chapter 162: The Taste of Love

Howard's POV

I glanced at my watch-ten o'clock already. Setting down the file I'd been reviewing. I exhaled deeply and massaged my aching shoulders. The room felt empty without Annie's presence. She must still be with Lucy,probably having fallen asleep beside her.

A warmth spread through my body as my mind drifted to Annie in the shower this morning, her wet silhouette tantalizingly visible through the steamy glass.

Damn it. I had planned to spend tonight with her, making up for tomorrow's separation with passionate embraces and intimate pleasure.The thought of Annie going to the factory signing event tomorrow, leaving us apart for an entire day, intensified both my desire and an unexpected restlessness that had settled in my chest.

I rose from my chair and walked into the hallway, noticing the soft light still spilling from beneath Lucy's bedroom door. After Penny revealed yesterday that Lucy was being bullied at school, Annie must have wanted to have a proper conversation with her about it. Their talk had clearly gone longer than expected, and Annie had likely fallen asleep alongside Lucy. Though I completely understood and supported Annie's decision,I couldn't help feeling a twinge of disappointment.

Standing outside Lucy's door, my fingers unconsciously gripped the doorframe as a powerful longing surged through me-a desire to have Annie back in my arms. I imagined what would happen if she appeared in the hallway right now: how I would gently pull her into my embrace.capture her lips with a fervent kiss,feel the softness of her body pressed against mine.

This sensation startled me. 1. Howard Thompson, the business executive renowned for his cool rationality. was actually feeling agitated over missing a night with a woman? I was even slightly irritated that Lucy was monopolizing Annie's attention.

Wait-was I jealous of a child? Competing with a five-year-old girl for Annie's company? The thought was absurd.

I recalled how before we became a couple, going several days without seeing each other had never been an issue. Now, just one evening without Annie left me unsettled. How would I handle tomorrow when Annie attended her comic book signing event and we wouldn't see each other all day? Hopefully, my busy work schedule would distract me from this longing.

I turned back toward the bedroom, gently closing the door behind me. Is this what love feels like? I had never imagined myself craving someone's company so desperately, feeling lost at the prospect of spending a day apart. I was beginning to understand why people in love behave in ways I once considered irrational.

Just as I lay down on the bed, my phone rang. Seeing Philip Baker's name on the screen, I answered without hesitation but deliberately maintained a cool tone: "What is it?"


"Get Annie to take the phone. I need to talk to her," Philip demanded, his voice urgent.

I responded coldly: "She's putting Lucy to bed. She probably doesn't have time to talk to you." I didn't tell him that Annie had likely fallen asleep with Lucy-I had no intention of giving him any hope. Philip laughed mockingly. "Don't you love Annie? How can you let her do these household chores?"

"I didn't even love Sarah, yet I still hired people to take care of her," he continued, his tone gleeful and spiteful. "It seems the great CEO Howard's love isn't as deep as it appears."

I could tell Philip was criticizing my treatment of Annie, but I remained unfazed. Adjusting my position slightly, I replied calmly: "Don't you know?Annie loves children."

"When Lucy is at school, she's happy to work part-time. But once Lucy returns. Annie wants to spend every possible moment with her."

I could sense Philip's shift in emotion through the phoneas I continued:"It's precisely because she loves children so much that when you and Sarah created so many problems, she chose to endure rather than divorce."

"Until later..." my voice grew colder, "when you and your son grew close to Sarah. even causing her to lose the baby she was carrying."

"Otherwise,she would have certainly compromised and stayed with you."
I knew these words would sting Philip, but I had no desire to feed any illusions he might harbor about Annie.

"That's all in the past," Philip said, a note of pain evident in his voice.


"Just like now," I replied, deliberately slowing my pace, "she earns far more from drawing comics than she did as a caregiver, yet she still chooses to continue looking after Lucy."

"Why do you think that is?" I asked pointedly.

I knew well thatif Annie had initially stayed for the money, she had since genuinely fallen in love with Lucy. Without exaggeration, she now treated Lucy as her own daughter. and Lucy had fully accepted Annie as her mother. This kind of connection couldn't be bought with money.

"I think she would do the same even if it were someone else's child... not yours." Philip responded.jealousy saturating his words as he tried to suggest Lucy wasn't special to Annie.

I found Philip's thinking absurd but didn't directly challenge it."Is that so?But Philip, when she was with you... you never paid her a salary, did you?" If Philip had been even slightly generous, Annie might not have found herself in such dire financial straits.

I emphasized each word: "When Annie is with us, she only needs to care for Lucy, nothing else, and earns eighty thousand dollars a month."

"But in your house, she had to do everything... how much did you pay her per month?" I knew this question would make him uncomfortable.

"What does money have to do with this?" Philip's voice was both angry and embarrassed.


"Everything," I replied methodically. "She asked for nothing from you, not even money... and in the end, she left with nothing."

"Annie is an adult who learns from past mistakes."


"She surely understands that unconditional giving is meaningless."

"So her subsequent contributions definitely require compensation." I delivered each statement slowly, letting every word pierce Philip's heart.

"How many people do you think would be willing to pay the price I offer?"
I asked calmly, knowing the question would unsettle him. The phone went silent for several seconds,and I knew Philip was realizing after serious consideration that indeed, very few people could match my offer.

"So your theory about substituting Lucy with another child doesn't hold up."I confidently stated. "She would only come to our home to be Lucy's mother."

"You're not the only one willing to spend money on women. Look how much I spent on Sarah..." Philip suddenly countered, though his tone revealed this was merely a weak defense.

I didn't directly address his provocation, instead asking calmly: "Then why,when you were together, were you particularly unwillingto spend money on Annie?"


Philip was speechless on the other end.

Knowing I had the upper hand, I continued: "If you had been just slightly more generous with her, spent a little more to make her feel your love, she would never have given up on you."

"You wouldn't be so regretful and unwilling to let go now."

I could almost picture Philip's expression at this moment-he must have felt a heaviness in his chest. He wanted to tell me I was wrong, but deep down,he knew I was right.

Hearing the continued silence on the other end, I decided to end the topic:"Besides work, it seems we have nothing else to discuss. Why not call again tomorrow morning?"

"Or..." I deliberately left a tantalizing pause. "Oh?" Philip's voice suddenly perked up.

"You can tell me now. and Til pass it on to her," I said in a businesslike tone,giving him no hope whatsoever.

"Never mind. I'll contact her myself tomorrow." Philip sounded disappointed.

Seeing that Philip had nothing more to say, I didn't press further and simply ended the call. After hanging up, I sighed deeply and looked toward the door. Annie must have fallen asleep with Lucy by now;she probably wouldn't return tonight. With a full day of work ahead, I needed to rest too. Yet even so, my mind remained filled with thoughts of Annie,contemplating how it would feel to go an entire day without seeing her.

This is love. I thought with self-deprecation. The once mighty Howard Thompson, now feeling empty because of a woman's absence. I turned off the lamp and closed my eyes, hoping tomorrow would come quickly so I could see Annie again sooner.
###Chapter 163: Money Makes Everything Rssibe
Sarah's POV

The moment I opened my eyes. Robert's words from last night pierced my heart like a dagger: "I hope you live well without me."

I slammed my fist into the pillow,fury threatening to consume me whole.The shattered pieces of my phone from last night's rage still littered my imported marble floor, a painful reminder of my humiliation. That bankrupt waste of space had actually refused me? After everything I'd done for him? I had offered him the perfect opportunity-help me get rid of Annie, and we could start over. But he chose to betray me instead.

I retrieved my backup phone from the drawer and walked to the window,coldly analyzing my situation. From the beginning, my target had always been Howard Thompson. He had status, wealth, looks-everything I wanted in a partner. Unfortunately, that country girl from Boston, Annie,had somehow managed to capture his attention before I could.

My strategy needed reconsideration. Until now, I'd relied on others to eliminate Annie and get closer to Howard, but that approach clearly wasn't working. Philip was too afraid of his mother to act decisively; Robert had proven himself utterly worthless, incapable of completing even the simplest task. Depending on these weak men had only led to repeated failures.

"Perhaps I should change tactics," I murmured to myself, my fingers tapping lightly against the window glass. "What about approaching Howard directly?"

After all, I, Sarah Johnson, had never lacked charm. In my experience, men were simple creatures,easily conquered with beauty and sweet words.Even Howard couldn't be completely immune to flattery and seduction.If I could just get his attention, make him doubt Annie.I could slip right in.

I returned to the sofa, picked up my phone, and carefully composed a message:"How much do you really like Annie?" The question was direct yet thought-provoking.

After sending it. I stared at the screen, checking for a response every few seconds. Strange-no reaction whatsoever. Had he blocked me? Impossible.
Howard was a businessman, far too professional for such childish behavior.

I tried again: "You haven't known Annie for very long, have you?"

Surprisingly. I received an almost immediate reply: "Does the reason matter? Or rather,does loving someone require a reason?"

A mocking smile curled my lips as anger flashed in my eyes. How ridiculous-Howard using such romantic excuses to mask his blindness.My fingers flew across the screen as I replied: "Of course it does." Love always has reasons, doesn't it? Wealth, status, appearance, family background... everyone has their calculations. Howard's naivety both surprised and disgusted me.

"But I don't think so," came his reply. "As long as she's right for me, and I m right for her, that's enough."

Every word felt like a slap to the face. Why did every successful,handsome,wealthy man prefer Annie? What special charm did that ordinary illustrator possess?

I changed tactics, typing a new message: "Are you sure Annie is the right person for you? Hasty decisions often lead to regret."

After sending this message. I smiled with satisfaction. I knew Howard's past-he had been quite the playboy until Lucy's parents died in that yacht accident. Only then did he abandon his carefree lifestyle to raise his niece. This sudden relationship was likely just the result of his long-term loneliness. Under normal circumstances, how could an elite like Howard fall for someone as ordinary as Annie at first sight?

There was a momentary pause before his reply: "Do you know why I never tried to be with anyone else?"

I casually responded: "Oh?"

His response came methodically: "I've been surrounded by women of all types-intelligent ones, naive ones... beautiful ones, elegant ones. But among all these women, I never felt the urge to fall in love. Including you."

These words hit me like a physical blow. Was he implying I wasn't good enough? My chest tightened painfully.

He continued: "Only with Annie do I feel that spending a lifetime together is worthwhile."


Every word dripped with his love for Annie. I couldn't bear to read anymore, turning off the phone and tossing it onto the sofa cushion.I couldn't understand it. Why did all the unremarkable men pursue me,while the successful ones only showed interest in Annie? What did she have that I didn't?


"Mom, I'm going to be late!" Max's voice called from the bedroom,interrupting my thoughts.

I took a deep breath, forcing myself to calm down. Howard's response was just a temporary setback; I couldn't show any negative emotions in front of my son.


"Coming, darling!" I made my voice sound light and cheerful.

On the way to drop Max off at school. I kept replaying the conversation in my mind. Howard's attitude was more resolute than I had anticipated.making it clear that directly approaching him wouldn't work. But his rejection only fueled my determination-I had never been one to give up easily.

As the driver opened the door for Max to get out, I watched my son run through the school gates. and suddenly inspiration struck me like lightning.If I couldn't directly change Howard's mind, then I needed to address the root of the problem.

Some things I could no longer rely on others to handle. I touched the diamond necklace around my neck, purchased with the alimony Robert had given me. Money-that was the real power. Why hadn't I thought of it before? Money makes the world go round, and with the right price,anything could be accomplished.

I could hire someone-not some half-baked helper, but a true professional who could permanently solve the Annie Baker problem. The thought sent a rush of excitement through me, like seeing a glimmer of light in the darkness.


"Wait a moment before heading back to the office," I told the driver,pulling out my phone from my purse. This plan required professional assistance. I dialed the number directly.

"I need you to monitor someone," I said when the call connected. "Who?" the voice on the other end asked.

1 emphasized each syllable clearly: "Annie Baker."

"Why do you want to monitor her?" the person inquired.

"That's none of your business," I replied dismissively. "Just let me know when she's alone. Once you've done that, your job is done."

After hanging up. I checked my bank account balance on my phone and smirked. I had almost forgotten that I was now a wealthy woman. With money, everything was possible. If I was generous enough, there was nothing in this world I couldn't accomplish.

Annie Baker, you'll soon understand that no one takes what belongs to Sarah Johnson. Whatever the cost, I will reclaim everything that should have been mine.
###Chapter 164: Adults Sometimes Make Conpl i cated Choices
Brian's POV

"Oh, what a beautiful morning, oh what a beautiful day..."

I woke up to Grandma Ruth's soft singing. She always sings this song from Oklahomal, which Mom says was her favorite musical when she was young. The familiar melody made me feel safe, like everything was going to be okay for another day.

I got dressed and walked into the kitchen where Grandma Ruth was frying bacon. Ms. Taylor and Mitchell seemed to be out, but they'd probably be back soon.

"Good morning, sleepyhead," Grandma Ruth smiled at me, the wrinkles around her eyes crinkling in that warm way. "Hungry?"

I nodded and sat down in my spot. Grandma's breakfasts always smell amazing.


"Eat up," Grandma Ruth put scrambled eggs and bacon on my plate and poured me a glass of orange juice. "What is the plan at school today?"

I was about to tell her about the performance rehearsal when the doorbell rang, the harsh sound cutting through our peaceful morning.

Grandma Ruth set down her spatula and went to answer the door while I continued eating my breakfast. From where I sat at the table, I could see toward the entrance. The visitor was Grandma Betty, her mouth set in a tight line and her eyebrows drawn together. "I'm here to see Brian," she announced as soon as she entered,her voice full of that grown-up bossiness.

Grandma Ruth replied calmly: "He's having breakfast."

Grandma Betty walked straight into the dining room, forcing a smile when she saw me: "Brian, it's been a long time.”.

I looked up at her: "Good morning. Grandma Betty."

"Is that all?" Her smile disappeared, eyebrows pinching together. "After not seeing me for so long, that's all you have to say? Is that what that Thompson girl's child has taught you about treating family?"

I put down my fork, feeling a tightness in my chest. Ever since Mom and Dad got divorced, Grandma Betty had taken Dad and Sarah's side and barely contacted me. I didn't understand why she suddenly showed up today.


"Brian,what kind of attitude is this?" Grandma Betty's voice turned sharp,her cheeks starting to flush. "I asked you a question. Why aren't you answering me?"


"If you came to have a normal conversation, I'd be happy to answer," I said. "But you look like you're angry."

Grandma Betty's face turned bright red, her eyes wide: "How dare you speak to me that way?"


"Betty!" Grandma Ruth walked over and stood beside me. Her voice was firm but not loud. "Did you come here toyell at a child?"

Grandma Betty turned to Grandma Ruth, looking her up and down with her lip curled: "When did they let an old woman from the Boston slums move in here? Look at those outdated clothes-people in the Upper East Side would cross the street to avoid you."

"She's my grandmother," I put down my silverware, feeling a wave of anger but trying to keep my voice steady. "She takes care of me."

Grandma Betty's mouth twitched: "Look how she's raised you. These types of people, once they get in the door, they take over everything."

"Grandma Betty," I took a deep breath, "we aren't family anymore. Now you're family with Dad and Sarah. I like living with Grandmà Ruth because she's good to me. You can't interfere with that."

Grandma Betty's mnouth fell open at my words, her expression changing from surprise to fury. A five-year-old child speaking to her this way completely wounded her pride.

Grandma Betty looked like she couldn't believe what she'd just heard.

Grandma Ruth gently ruffled my hair and turned to Grandma Betty: "I can see you've been saying bad things about me to Brian. That's why he was sometimes distant with me before. If you continue doing this,I won't be so polite."


Grandma Betty lifted her chin, eyes flashing with anger: "Are you threatening me? A woman living on welfare? My son's wealth has supported your entire family!"

"What did I say that was wrong?" Grandma Betty shot back."You and your daughter had nothing, not a penny to your names,completely dependent on my son for support!"

Grandma Ruth's expression turned serious: "First of all, when my daughter married your son, his investment firm barely had a reputation, and his ex- girlfriend had already left him. Annie never looked down on him.Now that his business is successful. he dumped her and found Sarah."

Grandma Betty's face stiffened for a moment before she quickly countered:"That's perfectly normal,isn't it?"

"Yes, very normal," Grandma Ruth's smile was cold. "Now Annie has left.just as you wanted. Aren't you satisfied yet?"

Grandma Betty pressed her lips together,not answering.

Grandma Ruth continued: "You gave up on Brian long ago. Why suddenly come looking for him today? To take out your frustrations? I won't let you bully him."


"You're only living with him to get money from my son," Grandma Betty's voice turned shrill. "Stop pretending."

"Didn't your son tell you?" Grandma Ruth raised an eyebrow. "He stopped paying child support for Brian a long time ago. We don't take a penny from him."


"Impossible!" Grandma Betty's eyes widened.

"If you don't believe me, call and ask him," Grandma Ruth crossed her arms,standing between me and Grandma Betty.

Grandma Betty hesitated, then took out her phone and dialed a number. I could see her gripping the phone so tightly her knuckles turned white.

"Philip," she said quickly, her voice tense, "are you no longer covering Brian's living expenses?"

I couldn't hear what Dad said on the phone, but I saw Grandma Betty's face turn pale.

"You're not joking, are you?" her voice became unsteady.

Dad said something else I couldn't hear.

"I told you to... but I didn't think..." Grandma Betty paused, then hung up the phone.

She stood there, her lips trembling slightly, clearly shocked.

"So," Grandma Ruth's voice was calm, "'confirmed?"

Grandma Betty just stared at Grandma Ruth, something in her eyes I'd never seen before.


"You and your son are both heartless," Grandma Ruth said. "When Sarah got pregnant. Philip abandoned Brian. And when you're angry about something, you come to take it out on an innocent'child. He's just a child-what did he do wrong?"

Grandma Betty's jaw tightened: "Because I'm his grandmother!"

"Are you worthy of being a grandmother?" Grandma Ruth's voice was low but powerful. "Brian has nothing to do with your family anymore. If you come to harass him again, don't blame me for being impolite."

Grandma Ruth pushed Grandma Betty toward the door and closed it behind her.


"How dare you speak to me like that!" Grandma Betty's shouts came through the door.

Grandma Ruth opened the door again: "What wouldn't I dare to do?" "It's all because of your daughter!" Grandma Betty's eyes flashed with rage
"They're already divorced. but she's still harassing Sarah.I went to help Sarah, and she called the police on me!

Grandma Ruth laughed, the kind of laugh that scared mne a little: "If the police took you away, it means you did something wrong, doesn't it? You say my daughter is harassing Sarah? That's ridiculous! Look at what kind of people you and Sarah are! An old woman who can't tell right from wrong and a woman who interfered in someone else's marriage! After the divorce. Annie just wanted to live quietly on her own, but you kept causing trouble! Of course she had to protect herself."

I'd never seen Grandma this angry before. Though her voice wasn't loud,each word was as sharp as a knife. Mom never told me about her divorce from Dad,but seeing Grandma's reaction now, I guessed she must have been through a lot of unfair treatment.

"You're all terrible people, yet you blame my daughter!" Grandma Ruth's voice finally rose as she walked toward the door. "I'll make sure you can't show your face in New York again!"

"Crazy woman!" Grandma Betty turned and ran.

"Don't run away if you're so brave!" Grandma Ruth chased after her.I instinctively walked to the door.

Grandma Betty ran into the elevator, frantically pressing the close button.Before the doors closed, I heard Grandma Ruth shout: "Come back again and see what I'll do to you!"

A few moments later, Grandma Ruth returned, her face still slightly flushed. She saw me standing at the door, let out a breath, and her expressi on suddenly turned worried"Brian..." she began, her voice returning to its usual gentleness.

"Grandma,you were awesome!" I couldn't help but smile.

"You're not afraid of me?" Grandma Ruth looked surprised, her eyebrows raised high.

"A little bit." I walked over and took her hand."But you were protecting me, and that makes me happy."

Grandma Ruth looked surprised, her expression softening: "That's good,then."

She led me back to the living room: "The food is still warm. Eat something before Mitchell takes you to school."

Back at the table, my mind kept replaying everything that had just happened. I'd never seen adults fight like that, especially not over me.Watching Grandma Ruth stand up to Grandma Betty was both scary and exciting.

I felt a strange mixture of emotions that I didn't fully understand. On one hand,knowing that Dad had really given up on me made me a little sad.He and Sarah must be very happy together. But on the other hand,I felt proud that Grandma Ruth didn't care about any of that. She just wanted me.


"Grandma..." I asked quietly while chewing a piece of bacon, "Will Dad abandon me,like forever?"

She paused, then nodded: "No. Maybe, I don't know. Adults sometimes make complicated choices, but that doesn't mean you're not important."

I nodded, though I wasn't sure I really understood.
###Chapter 165: A Peaceful Moment

Annie's POV

Lucy woke before me quietly studying my face as I slept. When I opened my eyes. I found her lying on her side, watching me with a brilliant smile.

"You're awake?" I asked, somewhat surprised.

"Yes," Lucy replied, her perfect white teeth showing as she grinned.

I cupped her rosy cheeks in my hands and gave her a gentle good morning kiss. Lucy mimicked my action, kissing my cheek in return.Then she wrapped her small arms around me and nestled silently against me for a moment before reluctantly lifting her head.

"Mom. I should get up now," she said in her soft, sweet voice,a hint of reluctance in her tone.

I stroked her golden hair and answered, "Go ahead."

Lucy carefully climbed out of bed, slipped on her little slippers,and headed toward the bathroom, looking back at me several times as she went.

I watched her retreating figure with a mixture of pride and melancholy.Despite her young age, she was already quite independent-capable of getting up, washing, and dressing herself without adult assistance. It was hard to believe she was growing up so quickly. While I felt proud of her development, I couldn't help feeling a touch of sadness, knowing that one day she would be completely independent, making her own way in the world.


Hiding my momentary melancholy, I also got up,saying,′′need to freshen up too." Lucy immediately poked her head out of the bathroom, her blue eyes sparkling with joy. "Then T'll wait for you downstairs!"
"All right!" I responded warmly.

When Lucy first entered my life, due to her selective mutism, she would cling to me constantly, afraid I might silently leave her. Now, through our time together, we had built genuine trust. She knew I loved her and wouldn't abandon her, so she no longer panicked when I needed to be temporarily away from her side.

I smiled as I left her bedroom, carefully closing the door behind me.Looking up. I saw Howard standing across the hall, a slightly forlorn expression on his face.

"You can be so heartless sometimes," Howard said, a teasing accusation in his voice.

"Hmm?" I responded, not understanding his meaning.

"I waited for you for a long time last night," Howard said softly as we walked side by side down the hallway, his voice deliberately lowered with a suggestive complaint, "I was hoping to spend a wonderful evening with you,but you fell asleep with Lucy instead."

I couldn't help but laugh. "Are you complaining that I didn't come back to our room to keep you company?"

Howard didn't answer directly. Instead, he leaned close to my ear, his deep gray eyes twinkling with mischief, his tone a mixture of flirtation and disappointment. "I guess I've grown accustomed to our intimate moments together each night. When that expectation is suddenly taken away, the entire evening becomes unbearable." Hearing these words. I took Howard's hand and teased. "Should I start refusing Lucy's requests for me to sleepin her room? I could spend all my time with you instead. How does that sound?"

Howard seemed momentarily tempted but ultimately shook his head."No.that's not necessary. Annie, knowing I have a place in your heart is enough."

My lips curved upward involuntarily. "Don't worry, Howard. As long as you never betray me, you ll always have a place in my heart."

Howard pulled me into his arms. "I'm not foolish like Philip. You can trust me completely. I will never betray you and will always treat you well.



I returned his embrace, then released him and returned to our bedroom to prepare for the day ahead.

After completing my morning preparations, we met in the dining room for breakfast. Lucy skillfully cut the fruit pancakes on her plate, showing no trace of the shy, introverted little girl from just a few months ago.Seeing her bright, cheerful smile filled me with pride-my daughter was thriving.

At the table, Lucy's grandfather Edward Parker added a spoonful of blueberries to her plate and casually mentioned, "This Saturday and Sunday, we're planning to take Lucy and her friend Penny to the Hamptons for a couple of days."

I turned to Lucy and asked. "Would you like to go?"

Lucy nodded excitedly.′′Yes!′′

"Then you should go," I said, then looked toward Edward."Would you like me to come along? Taking care of two children might be exhausting." Edward was getting older. and I worried about him becoming too tired.

Before Edward could decline, Lucy quickly interjected, "That won't be necessary. Mom. You should stay home and rest properly."

She took my hand, speaking with wisdom beyond her years. "Recently.your body and mind have been under a lot of pressure. You need time to recover properly."

"As for Grandpa and Grandma." Lucy continued solemnly, "you don't need to worry about them. When Penny and I play, we'll be careful not to tire them out too much!"

I looked uncertainly at Edward.

"Don't worry, we'll be fine," Edward reassured me, his gentle manner exuding an elegant gentility that made it easy to imagine that Lucy's mother must have been a woman of exceptional grace when she was alive.

Eleanor added, "Think of it as our opportunity for exercise."

"All right," I conceded, looking over at Howard.

Under the table, Howard squeezed my hand, his tone filled with amusement. "It seems Lucy has become quite considerate, already understanding the need to give her parents some time to nurture their relationship."


I lightly tapped his hand, signaling him to be careful with his words in front of Lucy's grandparents.

Howard's eyes crinkled with a smile as he nodded his understanding. "Let's eat." Since I needed to go to the printing factory in Brooklyn later. Howard arranged for his driver to take us first to Lucy's Upper East Side private preschool. I watched as she took Penny's hand and walked into the preschool building before returning to the car.

"We can head to the printing factory now," I told Howard.

Howard gently took my hand, his gaze lingering tenderly on me. "Don't be nervous. Your book signing will be a success."

The driver glanced at us in the rearview mirror, then quickly looked away,barely suppressing a smile. The intimate atmosphere clearly made him a bit uncomfortable.

When we arrived at the printing factory in Brooklyn, representatives from the publishing house were already waiting at the entrance. They led us to a small building filled with stacks of books, many already opened, waiting for my signature.

Taking a deep breath, I sat at the table and began diligently signing the illustrations in my children's books.

After signing each book, someone would take it away, and another person would place a new book in front of me. I looked at them in surprise.

"Why have you stopped signing?" they asked, puzzled by my hesitation.

"This is the first time I've experienced this kind of treatment," I explained,referring to the efficient system they had established where I only needed to focus on signing. "It feels a bit surreal."

The publishing house staff shrugged it off. "There are many books to sign today. If we didn't help you and left you to sign them all by yourself,you might not finish until next year!"Another staff member added. "The market has been terrible for the past few years with the cconomic downturn. We weren't sure if our publishing house would survive until the end of this year.."

"Then your comic suddenly appeared!"

"In just a few days, it sold hundreds of thousands of copies!"


"Thanks to you, our publishing house can continue operating!"

Having been a housewife for so many years, I never imagined I could have such an impact, that I could truly help others in this way. "That's wonderful." I said sincerely.

"It really is!" they replied in unison.

I continued signing the books. As one person took away each signed book,another placed a new one in front of me.

Listening to their cheerful conversation, I gradually relaxed. Even the intimidating piles of books filling the room didn't seem so scary anymore.As we fell into a smooth, efficient rhythm, my signing speed increased.

When we reached the last few books, my hand felt like it was about to fall off, and the two staff members were visibly tired as well. I suggested,"Should we take a break?"


A female staff member checked her watch. "It's already lunchtime. Let's eat first to regain our energy."

"There's a nice Italian restaurant down the street where we could have lunch together," I proposed, flexing my fingers that had stiffened from the extended signing session. "To be honest. I'd prefer to finish the signing work as quickly as possible,"another staff member said hesitantly. "If we go to a restaurant now,the round trip might take too long. I actuaally want to finish work early as I have a date this afternoon..."

Her colleague smiled and added, "We usually just eat simple sandwiches or something to save more time."

Looking at their enthusiasm and dedication to work efficiency, I couldn't help but smile. Youth is such a beautiful thing.

"There's no need to push yourselves," a familiar voice came from the doorway, drawing our attention.
###Chapter 166:See You Soon
Annie's POV

"There's no need to push yourselves," a familiar voice came from the doorway, drawing our attention.

I turned to see Susan standing there, holding several food containers and a beautiful bouquet of flowers. I blinked in surprise, not expecting to see Howard's secretary here.

"Susan? What brings you here?" I asked curiously, standing up from the signing table.

Susan smiled as she walked into the room. "Mr. Thompson was concerned you might not have time for a proper lunch, so he asked me to bring you all something." She set the containers on a nearby table, carefully opening each one. "These are from that restaurant near the office that you both frequent."

As the containers opened, the aroma of Italian roasted chicken and grilled vegetables immediately filled the room. I instantly recognized the signature dishes from the small restaurant that Howard and I loved.

My colleagues from the publishing house and the staff helping organize my comics brightened visibly, exchanging surprised glances.

"This is for me?" I asked somewhat shyly, my fingers lightly touching the edge of one container.

"It's for all of you," Susan clarified with a smile,gesturing to include my hardworking colleagues. "Mr. Thompson specifically mentioned that everyone should enjoy a hearty lunch,considering Annie's book signing is such a major undertaking."

Susan then approached me with the bouquet-a stunning arrangement of pink and white tulips whose fresh fragrance permeated the room, slightly masking the printing factory's ink smell.

"These are especially from Mr. Thompson to you." She handed me a small card along with the flowers.

I took the card, gently opening it to read the message: "Enjoy your lunch,and don't forget about me." The simple words sent a wave of warmth through my chest. Even when we were apart for half a day,Howard was thinking of me.

Then,my colleagues and I gathered around to enjoy the delicious lunch Howard had sent. The food was far more substantial than the sandwiches we had planned, and everyone ate with evident delight and satisfaction.

"Your boyfriend is so thoughtful," one female colleague responsible for binding my comics remarked after taking a bite of the Italian roasted chicken. "Even remembering us ordinary staff members."

Another colleague nodded in agreement: "My boyfriend can't even remember my birthday, let alone send lunch on a workday."

"Howard is indeed very considerate," I smiled in response, feeling a surge of gratitude.


Just as we finished lunch, the main door of the printing factory suddenly swung open. A small group of people peered in, their eyes lighting up when they spotted me.

"It's her! It's really Annie Baker!" an excited young woman in her early twenties exclaimed, clutching my comic book "Resilience in New Life" tightly. Behind her followed three or four equally young friends.all holding copies of my comics.

The publishing staff immediately grew tense: "I'm sorry, this is a work area.not open to the public..."

"It's alright." I stood up. smiling at the fans. "Did they come specifically to find me?"

The young woman nodded, her cheeks flushed with excitement: "We saw on social media that you were signing books here today,and we...we just wanted to meet you. Your comic really changed my life!"

I was stunned, unable to believe my comics could have such a profound impact on strangers. "Really?"

"Absolutely!" the girl responded enthusiastically, carefully opening her comic book. "The story of your female protagonist rebuilding herself after betrayal is so moving. I went through a terrible breakup last year, and your comic gave me the courage to move forward."

Another young man added: "And your art style is so unique-that delicate yet humorous way you depict complex emotions is simply genius!"

I felt a warm current flow through my body-this feeling of being understood and appreciated by readers was more precious than any acclaim. "Thank you all, truly. If you'd like me to sign your books..."

They nodded excitedly, carefully handing over their comics. I signed each one and took photos with them. One of the girls even brought a small comic she had created trying to imitate my style,which deeply touched me.

After the fans reluctantly departed, I returned to my small signing stati on to continue working. Perhaps inspired by the fans' enthusiastic encouragement, my movements became more fluid.

My signature traced elegant arcs across the comic book title pages,both quick and beautiful.

Watching the name "Annie Baker" become increasingly natural in my handwriting. I couldn't help feeling a touch of pride.

At four-thirty in the afternoon, when I signed the last comic, my hand was so tired I could barely lift it. I exhaled deeply, set down the pen,and looked around-we had completed signing eight full boxes of comics.The two colleagues from the publishing house looked as exhausted as I felt,practically collapsing into their chairs, completely drained.

"I need to go pick up my child now," I stood up, stretching my stiff shoulders. "Are there more comics to sign tomorrow? If so, I can come in the morning. Lucy's kindergarten has a performance in the afternoon that I need to attend."

"No need," the senior editor replied, tired but satisfied. "Today's batch is enough to cover the first round of distribution."

"If we need you to sign more for reprints, we'll notify you in advance,"another added, eyes full of admiration.

"Thank you so much for today, Annie. You know, your comic series saved our entire publishing house-with the economic downturn, we were on the verge of bankruptey. 'Resilience in New Life' was literally our lifeline."

I felt a mixture of humility and pride. From being betrayed by Philip,going through a painful divorce, to now having my own successful comic series, a man who loves me, and an adorable stepdaughter. My comic not only told the story of a woman recovering from betrayal and finding a new 
life but also touched the hearts of others.

"I also want to thank you for believing in my comic creation," I said sincerely. "Being able to help others through my work is an honor I never imagined."


I gathered my bag and the flowers Howard had sent, then stood up. "After Lucy's school performance tomorrow. I'll text you. Perhaps we can discuss ideas for a new comic series."

The driver was already waiting outside and immediately opened the car door for me. After sitting in the car, I dialed Howard's number.

"Hi," his voice came through the car's Bluetooth system, warm and familiar."Is the comic signing finished?"

"Just completed." I answered, feeling tired but satisfied. "Thank you for the lunch and flowers, that was so thoughtful. And guess what? Some fans came to see me today!"

"Really? That's wonderful," Howard's voice was filled with pride and joy."I always said your comics would become popular, and now fans are even coming to find you."

Hearing his pride in me sent a wave of warmth through my chest.

"Yes, one girl said my comic helped her and her mother," I recalled, still moved by it. "Being able to help others through my work feels really special."

"You deserve all of this, Annie," Howard said sincerely. "You and Lucy are the most important people in my life, and taking care of you is both my responsibility and honor. Seeing your talent recognized makes me happier than anyone." This kind of warm support and recognition was something I had never experienced in my marriage with Philip. "Should I come to your office to meet you first? Then we can go pick up Lucy together?"

Howard chuckled softly. "No need. Annie. Going back and forth would be too tiring for you. I'm already on my way to the kindergarten,and we can meet directly there."

"Are you sure? I don't want to make you change your plans for me," I asked somewhat hesitantly, not wanting to disrupt his work schedule.

"Of course I'm sure." his voice was firm yet gentle. "You've already worked all day. and I don't want you to be more tired. I'm also eager to see you soon."

His thoughtfulness made my lips curl upward involuntarily. "Alright, I'll see you at the kindergarten then."

"See you soon," he replied, his voice full of anticipation.

After hanging up. I leaned back in my seat, closing my eyes to rest for a moment. The changes that had occurred over the past year still seemed incredible to me. From being betrayed by Philip, going through a painful divorce,to now having my own successful comic series, a man who loves me,and an adorable stepdaughter.

Things are a bit surreal, actually.


The driver stopped the car at the entrance of the Upper East Side Private Preschool. I stepped out of the car and stood at the kindergarten entrance,waiting for Lucy. I looked around, anticipating the sight of Howard.

"Annie," a voice called from behind me. Is it Howard?
###Chapter 167: But What If She's Walking Into Another Trap?
Philip's POV

I was jolted awake by the shrill ringing of my phone, a pounding headache making it difficult to focus. The sunlight streaming through the half-drawn curtains indicated it was already late afternoon. I groaned,running a hand through my disheveled hair as I searched for the source of the noise.

These past few days. Dr. Matthews' words had been echoing in my mind like a cruel mirror, forcing me to confront the person I truly was. His clinical assessment had stripped away the comfortable illusions I'd built around myself.

"When you honestly answer these questions, you need to determine if your desire for reconciliation with Annie stems from genuine love, or merely resentment at seeing her flourish without you," his voice resonated clearly in my ears. "Or perhaps you simply miss the comfort her care provided,but are only willing to value that care at a housekeeper's salary.The extra money,you'd rather keep entirely for yourself."

I sat up in bed, wincing at the sharp pain behind my eyes. Last night's decision came flooding back to me. After hours of soul-searching, I had finally acknowledged an uncomfortable truth: what I had felt for Sarah wasn't love but merely vanity and stubbornness. My ego couldn't accept that she had rejected me, so I'd spent years trying to prove her wrong.

And Annie... I had hurt her deeply, making her endure pain she never deserved. The realization of how I had treated her-taking her for granted.being stingy with money even as our financial situation improved, forcing her to live frugally while I impressed others with my wealth filled me with a shame I had never experienced before.

Last night. I had summoned the courage to call Howard. Not to threaten or compete, but to ask him to arrange a conversation with Annie. I wanted to apologize for everything I'd done, to tell her I hoped we could part on better terms, and maybe someday even become friends. Though I couldn't speak directly with Annie, this decision had brought me a small measure of peace.

I glanced at my phone again. Annie's number was still in my contacts list,though I knew she had blocked me long ago. Since the divorce, she had cut off all communication channels with me, which was why I had to call Howard last night. Today, I needed to find a way to speak with her face-to-face.


Just then, my phone suddenly rang. The screen displayed Allen Stark's name-my friend and the private investigator I had hired to look into Howard's background.

"Hello?" I answered, my tone tinged with impatience.

"Phílip, it's Allen," his voice sounded excited, energized. "You asked me to investigate Howard Thompson's past, right? I've made a significant discovery."

My attention was immediately captured. "What discovery? Tell me."

"Apparently, the woman Howard loved was his high school classmate..."
Allen beganrecounting his findings.

I leaned back against the headboard, listening intently as Allen continued.

"This female classmate was academically excellent-always first in class, incredibly intelligent." Allen explained.

"Even though Howard wasn't fully dedicated to his studies at the time-he preferred experimenting with small business investments-he was extremely proud and believed he should be number one."

"So he eventually channeled all his non-business energy into studying,but still couldn't surpass her. This frustrated him considerably."

"What bothered him most was that other classmates called this girl a nerd...if she was just a nerd, then what did that make them, who couldn't even outperform a nerd?"

"Howard asked her how she managed to achieve such good grades.She told him it was simple and even shared her study techniques."

"Later he discovered that this female classmate worked so hard at school to build her reputation. Her goal was to impress wealthy classmates with her abilities so they would hire her as a tutor."

I lay back down, feeling a strange mixture of emotions. "Is that when Howard started to be attracted to her?"

"More or less," Allen confirmed.

I contemplated the significance of this information. Howard was attracted to intelligent, independent women... traits remarkably similar to Annie's.Annie might not be an academic genius, but she was creative, persistent,and had shown extraordinary resilience in the face of adversity. Was this merely coincidence?

"You're saying Howard fell for a smart girl in high school," I said slowly,"but what does this have to do with Annie?" "Not sure yet." Allen admitted. "but I suspect Howard's attraction to Annie might be connected to his past. You know. people are often drawn to those who remind them of their first love."

This thought made me uncomfortable. What if Howard only loved Annie because she reminded him of someone else, not for who she truly was?

"What happened next? Did they get together?" I pressed.

"I'm still investigating," Allen replied, "but it seems their story doesn't have a clear ending. They probably went their separate ways."

I sat up straighter, an idea forming in my mind. "Keep digging. If Howard is just using Annie as a substitute... then his feelings for her aren't real,right?”

"Maybe," Allen sounded uncertain, "but remember, even if the initial attraction comes from similarities, feelings can develop into something genuine over time."

I hung up, sinking into deep thought. Allen's discovery had exploded like a bomb in my mind. Howard liked smart, independent women? He had once loved a girl with qualities similar to Annie's?

If Howard's feelings for Annie weren't genuine, if he was merely using Annie as a substitute for that high school girl, shouldn't I tell Annie the truth? Should I try once more to win her back?

Suddenly, I felt ashamed. Just moments ago, I had decided to let go,to respect Annie's choices, to apologize for my mistakes; and now, merely because of a vague lead about Howard's past, I was wavering.

"What am I thinking?" I whispered to myself, "If I truly love Annie. I should want her to be happy, even if that means she chooses someone else. But simultancously,if Howard wasn't sincere about Annie, didn't I have a responsibility to let her know? After all, she had already experienced betrayal and hurt once...

I checked my watch and realized it was alroady late afternoon. The Upper East Side Private Preschool would be dismissing students soon, and Annie would certainly be there to pick up Luey.If I left now, I might catch her at the school gates and have a few minutes to talk privately.

After quickly getting ready, I sat in my car, contemplating the impending encounter. Would I choose honest apology, blessing her relationship with Howard; or would I use Allen's discovery to plant seeds of doubt about Howard's sincerity? Would I finally let go,or would I fight for one more chance?

"If I truly love her, I should want her happiness," I told myself,then immediately countered, "But what if she's walking into another trap?"

I started the engine and drove toward the Upper East Side, the conflict in my heart unresolved. Perhaps, when I looked into Annie's eyes,I would know what to do.
###Chapter 168: I Completely Understand

Howard's POV

I had just returned to my office after lunch when Robert Johnson walked in. His demeanor had changed significantly since his family's financial collapse-the arrogant heir was now replaced by a man humbled by circumstance. As he handed mne a folder containing his project proposal.I noticed his slightly nervous posture.

I quickly reviewed the documents, noting both the promising concept and the overly cautious implementation strategy.

"Did you prepare these yourself?" I asked calmly, placing the folder on my desk.


Robert nodded, meeting my gaze directly. "Yes, I did everything myself."

"The progress is too slow," I stated matter-of-factly."Your project's greatest advantage is speed-being first to market. If you can't develop it in the shortest time possible, and someone else has the same idea and starts working on it..." I paused deliberately, making sure my point was clear,"then you have no advantage at all. Do you understand?"

Robert nodded solemnly. "I understand, but I just didn't want to waste your money."

I could see the transformation in him. Since his family's investment company went bankrupt, he was no longer the privileged heir to a fortune.He had learned firsthand how difficult it was to get anyone in New York's brutal business environment to lend him money or invest in his ideas.That's why he was trying to save me expenses. "T'm not short on money." I replied expressionlessly."If you want to make a comeback in this industry, you need to be more generous,not hesitant about spending."
Robert focused intently on me. "I see that now."

"Good." Satisfied with his response, I posinted out several potential issues in the project implementation process, drawing on my years of experience in the tech industry.

Robert carefully noted everything down, marking up the project documentation, clearly intending to make the changes as soon as he returned to his workspace.

I nodded with satisfaction, then took out my phone and called the head of Human Resources, asking him to come to my office.

The HR manager arrived promptly. "You wanted to see me, Mr.Thompson?" he inquired.

"Yes," I stood up and introduced Robert. "This is Robert Johnson. He has a new project and needs to hire some staff. Could you understand his requirements and help with the recruitment?"

The manager immediately turned to Robert. "Approximately how many people do you need? What kind of talent are you looking for?"

Robert looked back at me, clearly still uncertain about making major decisions without my explicit approval.

I nodded encouragingly, wanting him to take ownership of his project.

Only then did Robert explain his requirements to the manager,gradually gaining confidence as he outlined the specific skills and experience needed. After listening, the HR manager confirmed his understanding and said."T Il bring you good news soon."
"Thank you," Robent replied, with more authority in his voice than I had heard in months.

Having reached an agreement, the two men bid me farewell and walked toward the door.

I calmly nodded in acknowledgment, then sat back in my chair.1considered my plan-helping Robert rebuild his career while redirecting Sarah's attention back to him. If Sarah became busy pursuing Robert or his business ventures, she would have less time to cause trouble for Annie.
Although Robert had seen through Sarah's facade and recognized that she didn't truly love him, but merely used him as a tool for social climbing.How Robert would handle Sarah's entanglement was his own business. My only goal was to divert Sarah's attention away from Annie.

"Knock,knock."

Hearing someone at the door, I said, "Come in."

Catherine Morgan pushed open the office door and walked in. She looked around, her expression immediately turning confused.

"Where's Annie?" she asked, her gaze lingering on the spot where Annie usually worked.

"She went to sign books at the printing factory in Brooklyn," I answvered.

Catherine's shoulders visibly slumped, her mouth turning downward."
Why didn't you tell me earlier?" Her tone carried a hint of reproach Rather than answering directly. I countered. "If I had told you,would you have believed me?"
Catherine looked at me and shook her head without hesitation."Of course not."
"Then why would I waste the effort?" I replied calmly.

I noticed Catherine's brow furrow slightly before smoothing out again.evidently weighing my logic. After a few seconds, she pouted but didn't argue.

"What did you need her for?" I asked.

Catherine lifted her chin slightly. "I'll talk to her when she gets back."With that, she turned toward the office door, her high heels making sharp sounds against the floor.

After pulling the door open, she didn't immediately close it, and I saw Susan standing outside with a stack of files in her hands. The two women stood in the doorway, apparently unaware that I could hear their conversation.

"Any new gossip?" Susan's voice was lowered, but still clearly audible in the quiet office. Her eyes sparkled with excitement.

"Yes!" Catherine responded in an equally hushed tone, stepping a few paces outside the door. "I've been dying to share it with someone."

I watched as Susan leaned closer to Catherine, whispering, "Wait for me after work. We'll find somewhere to chat properly!"

"Deal!" Catherine answered,looking quite pleased. I shook my head slightly.somewhat amused by the scene.

The office gossip network probably operated more efficiently than any of our business projects. Catherine's marketing team had just completed their quarterly project, so it seemed she indeed had some spare time to collect and spread company anecdotes.

Perhaps it was time to assign her some new tasks-after all,idle employees easily directed their energy to unnecessary places. I looked forward to seeing her new ideas for market expansion at the next department meeting.

The two women hadn't realized I was observing all this. After making their arrangement, Catherine left, and Susan turned to enter my office.closing the door behind her.

"Mr. Thompson," she resumed her professional demeanor and asked."Previously when you needed to hire staff, you always had me arrange it.Why not today?"


"You're too busy," I explained. I knew she was already responsible for Annie's comics and handling other administrative matters,with her work hours already fully scheduled.

Susan seemed dissatisfied. "But that's part of my job responsibilities. When you do this, it makes me wonder if I'm not performing well enough."

"Not at all." I assured her. "You've been doing excellently."

Susan smiled. "Then in the future,please tell me about anything directly,and Ill arrange it for you?"

Seeing her willingness to take on these tasks, I agreed.∘Alright. Susan began her report: "The foreign publishers have completed the publishing process for Annie's comic, but they're planning to print only one batch of books initially, without immediate sales. They want to produce a movie first, then launch merchandise and books when it's globally released, which is expected to generate explosive sales.However.they're asking if we're willing to invest upfront."

I didn't respond immediately, carefully considering the proposal.

"If the box office performance is good, we'll certainly make a substantial profit," Susan added, with slight excitement in her voice.

"But have you considered what would happen if the box office performance is poor?" I asked.

Susan blinked,looking slightly confused,obviously having not thought of this. "So your idea is not to invest,just give them operational rights?"

"That's not my style," I replied. "If wwe're going to invest, according to their plan, there must be one critical element-we must ensure absolute decision-making authority over this project. Otherwise, they'll produce a terrible movie,claim it was made according to our requirements, and swallow our investment. If the box office is poor, we suffer significant losses."

Susan's expression changed immediately. She sat up straight, her fingers unconsciously tightening for a moment before relaxing. "I'm sorry, Mr.Thompson. I didn't initially consider these factors."

"It's fine. We can invest because we're not short on money,but what's important is..." I paused for emphasis, "we cannot be taken advantage of.Since we're investing. we have the right to oversee the fiIm content.We can negotiate with them to reach a mutually beneficial outcome, but the minimum requirement is that the movie must b e engaging." "I understand. Should I communicate with them now?" Susan nodded.already picking up her notebook.
"Not so fast. let me finish. The film production cycle typically ranges from three months to a year before official release. If we want to maximize the film's value, we must have our animation department staf create as much animated content from the comics as possible during this time."
Susan's brow furrowed slightly, seemingly trying to grasp my reasoning.

"This way, when the film is officially released and people are paying attention to this work, they'll search for related information. The film's viral success will increase awareness of the work. What we want to do is extend the comic's influence for as long as possible, so both Annie and we can benefit more."

Susan's eyes brightened, and she quickly jotted something in her notebook,occasionally nodding. "I completely understand, Mr. Thompson."

"Now you can contact the publishers," I said.

"Yes,sir," she replied,closing her notebook and promptly leaving my office.

My thoughts drifted to Annie, wondering how her day at the printing factory was going, and looking forward to seeing her soon at Lucy's school.
###Chapter 169: Why Are You Calling Me?

Sarah's POV

I was lounging on my Italian leather sofa, flipping through the latest issue of Vogue, when my phone rang. Caroline Gluck's name flashed across the screen. I hesitated momentarily before answering-Caroline was useful for information, but her endless chatter could beexhausting.
"Sarah. I just saw Robert walking into Howard's office!" Caroline's voice bubbled with excitement and conspiracy. "They were in there together for quite a while. It looked like they were discussing business."
"What?" Iimmediately put down my magazine, sitting up straight. "Are you certain it was him?"
"Of course," Caroline replied confidently. "I wouldn't mistake your ex-husband.He was wearing that charcoal gray suit, and he looked much better-not as defeated as before."

I gripped my phone tighter, feeling an unexpected surge of irritation.Robert had gone to see Howard without telling me? After his family's company went bankrupt, he'd been wallowing in self-pity for months. I hadn't expected him to pull hímself together so quickly.

"He must be trying to start a new business," Caroline continued,her voice dripping with that fake sweetness I'd come to recognize. "You know how these trust fund boys can turn their fortunes around as easily as drinking water. Sarah, you're so clever! I used to think you were wasting your time staying entangled with him, but now I understand how wise you've been!"

I didn't respond to Caroline's flattery. Instead, I rubbed my temple,feeling a headache forming. "I have some bad news to tell you." "What is it?" Her tone immediately shiftedI to concern-likely fake.but useful nonetheless.


"Just two or three days ago. I had a huge fight with Robert. I said a lot of hurtful things." I closed my eyes, recalling that night. I had completely lost my patience with him, saying cruel words I knew would cut deep, even telling him I had never truly loved him.

"Is that all?" Caroline's voice lightened instantly. "I thought it was something serious! Everyone knows Robert is still hopelessly devoted to you. If you're willing to say a few sweet words to him, he'll undoubtedly rush back to your side and continue adoring you."

"I hope so," I sighed. Caroline didn't understand. Robert had his pride and dignity. Although he loved me, I doubted he would easily forgive this latest wound.


After hanging up, I walked to my floor-to-ceiling windows,my thoughts drifting to Robert. I had to admit, of all the men I'd known, if anyone had genuine feelings for me, it was Robert. Even after our divorce, he still appeared in my life from time to time, hoping for reconciliation.

I needed to find a way to make amends with him. After all, if my plans with Howard didn't succeed, I needed a reliable backup plan.

Just as I was contemplating how to reconnect with Robert, my phone rang again. This time, it was the person I'd hired to monitor Annie.

"Annie is alone in a room right now!" His voice sounded excited, almost breathless.

I immediately became alert, my heart racing. This was exactly the opportunity I'd been waiting for! Annie was usually inseparable from Howard; finding a moment when she was alone was incredibly rare.

"Where? What's the exact address?" I asked urgently. I wasn't planning to go there myself-I just needed to confirm if the location was suitable for my plan.

There was a hesitant pause on the other end. "Didn't you promise me a bonus when I told you she was alone?"
I silently cursed this greedy fool, but maintained my generous façade."Of course, I keep my word." Without hesitation, I took out my phone and transferred two payments totaling $100,000. It meant nothing to me-as long as my plan succeeded, this amount was insignificant. However, if he proved useless in the end, I would make him pay back double.
"She's at a printing factory in Brooklyn, in a small book signing room," he finally said, then sent me a photo. "There's only her in the room."
"What?" His answer was like a bucket of cold water dumped over my head."When you said 'alone in a room,' you meant in a room at a printing factory?"

"Yes,just like in the photo I sent you," he answered thoughtlessly. "There's definitely only her in that room."

I struggled to contain my fury while maintaining a calm exterior. "But there must be many other workers and staff in the printing factory,right?"

"Uh, yes," he admitted sheepishly. "It is a large printing factory, after all..."

"You idiot!" I finally exploded. "Even if we could enter that room,how could we possibly take her through the entire factory without being seen?Do you think this is some low-budget action movie?" In my mind,I knew -environment completely free from suspicion.

"What are you planning to do to her?" he asked naively.

I immediately realized I'd said too much. "That's none of your business!"I quickly shifted my tone, appearing more controlled. "You just need to follow instructions. Next time, only call me when there's absolutely no one around her, understand? Like when she's alone at home, or somewhere without surveillance and personnel." I couldn't reveal too many details of my plan, but I had to make my requirements clear.

"Understood," his tone carried a hint of resentment. "I called you thistime because you weren't clear before. You only said to notify you when she was alone..."


"Well. I've made myself clear now, haven't I?" I slowed my speech,ensuring he fully understood. "If this happens again, I'll find someone else!I have plenty of money, and if you can't help me properly, someone else certainly will!" In truth, findinga suitable replacement wouldn't be easy,but threats were always effective.


His attitude changed immediately. "Don't worry, I'll follow your instructions exactly. I'll continue monitoring her and notify you when the right moment comes."

"Good," I said, then ended the call.


I tossed my phone onto the sofa and took a deep breath to calm myself.This fool had wasted my time and money, but I couldn't let this minor setback affect my plans. Annie Baker, you won't be lucky forever. Someday,I'll find an opportunity to make you pay, to expose your true nature to everyone. My thoughts returned to Caroline's news about Robert. I stared at my phone screen for a long time, recalling the days I spent with him.He had always adored me. even at my worst. When everyone else abandoned him after his family's bankruptcy. I chose to stay-primarily to maintain my lifestyle. but I did give him hope and support.
Perhaps it was time to leverage this relationship again. If Robert truly could turn his fortunes around, he might once more become a valuable resource. More importantly, if he established a business relationship with Howard, he could serve as my bridge to getting closer to Howard.
Having made my decision, I dialed Robert's number. After several rings, he answered.

"Why are you calling me?" His voice sounded surprised, lacking the warmth and eagerness I was accustomed to hearing.
I took a deep breath, preparing to begin my performance. I needed to appear both sincere and vulnerable, to make him believe I truly regretted my actions. Whatever it took, I would bring Robert back to my side. At the same time, I wouldn't abandon my plans against Annie. No one takes anything from Sarah Johnson-whether it's wealth,status, or the man I deserve.
###Chapter 170:Who Is Calling My Name?

Annie's POV

"Annie."

Hearing someone call my name. I turned around, expecting to see Howard.

Instead. I found Philip Baker walking toward me. He looked haggard,with obvious dark circles under his eyes, as if he'd been through a sleepless night. His expression carried that all-too-familiar urgency and unease, the kind that usually meant he was about to launch into another round of confessions and explanations.
*Here we go again.* I sighed inwardly. Since our divorce, he had tried to contact me countless times with various excuses, to the point where I had to block all his contact methods. Each time we met, he claimed to have some "new realization," but never showed any genuine change.
The smile on my face vanished instantly, and I instinctively turned around,wanting to retreat back into the car. A relationship that was once so important had now become nothing but a nuisance I wanted to avoid.

Philip stood in front of me, blocking my path. "I have something I want to tell you."

"Sorry!" I refused coldly. "I don't want to hear it."

*Why does he always think I'm obligated to listen to him? We're already divorced, and I've made it clear that I don't want any contact with him.*

Philip didn't give me a chance to refuse, immediately saying,′′Iwent to see a psychologist a few days ago..." This statement caught my attention, and I couldn't help but look at him.Philip had always considered psychological counseling a sign of weakness.He actually went to see a psychologist voluntarily?
Philip continued. "He asked me many questions, and after thinking through each one. I realized that after we got married. I truly wronged you.


"I didn't like Sarah, yet because Sarah was my first love, I gradually moved closer to her, neglected you, and hurt you."
"That was my fault."

I listened quietly to everything he said, then asked with an unchanged expression, "So?"

*The same old routine. Every time I want to cut ties completely, he appears with some so-called "new realization."*

Philip was caught off guard, clearly not expecting such a cold response to his "major discovery."

After a long while, he lowered his head and answered uncomfortably,"The person I truly love is you..."

I responded calmly, "But you've said the same thing countless times since our divorce."

"Each time with genuine emotion."

"Even during our marriage, you would act as if you loved me deeply."

*But that was just a facade.* I added in my heart. He always appeared extremely remorseful after making mistakes, yet never truly changed his
behavior. I had lost count of how many times I had believed his apologies,only to end up with more disappointment.
He always liked to placate me with words, but when it came to actually making sacrifices, he was always stingy. The money he saved for "our family" was ultimately spent on pleasing those he deemed "important,"with no regard for my needs and feelings.
I asked softly. "And what was the result?"

"Didn't you continue to hurt me all the same?"

"I only divorced you when I realized there was no hope in persisting."

If the harm he caused me had only happened once or twice, someone like me who never had high expectations for marriage would definitely have endured it. I had learned resilience from my mother and knew that life wasn't a fairy tale, but Philip's repeated betrayals eventually exhausted all my patience.

I looked at Philip, thinking:∗I∗'ve had enough of this meaningless entanglement.*

Philip pressed his lips together, looking troubled."I will change..."

I chuckled lightly, "But I don't need that anymore."

"Whether you love me or hate me, it doesn't matter to me."

"After leaving you, I have a new life,a new partner."

"He treats me well."

"He makes me feel what it's like to be loved." *Every day with Howard makes me understand what true respect and care are, not your apologies after selfishness and your false concern.*
I continued unhurriedly, "So I don't need you anymore,understand?"

"You don't need to come find me every time you reach a new conclusion,or discover traces of love for me in some insignificant thing, just to tell me you still love me."

"It's unnecessary."

"For me..."


"Hearing you say these things is nothing but a waste of time."

*Your every appearance only reminds me of those painful memories. I've already wasted too much time and tears on them.*
Philip seemed not to have expected that I truly had no feelings left for him.He stepped forward somewhat urgently, trying to grab my hand."Annie..."

I instinctively stepped back, naturally resisting any contact with him. The person who once gave me a sense of security now only made me feel annoyed and repulsed.

His arm, just about to grab me, was intercepted.

Howard stood in front of me and said, "Mr. Baker, this is my girlfriend.Please show some restraint!”

Seeing Howard appear, I felt a sense of relief. After a busy day at the printing factory, being able to pick up Lucy with him gave me a warm sense of belonging.

Philip locked eyes with Howard. "But Mr. Thompson don't vou think you re being despicable?"

"Pursuing her right after our divorce, when she was vulnerable..."

"Taking advantage of her weakness is hardly gentlemanly behavior!"

Hearing Philip criticize Howard, I almost laughed.*In his world,I'm forever just an appendage without independent will-first his wife,now Howard's "stolen" trophy. He never saw me as a person capable of making my own choices.*

Howard scoffed, "But. I don't recall ever claiming to be a gentleman, do I?"

Philip was speechless, his expression slightly contorted.

Howard continued, "My thinking differs from Mr. Baker's. Mr. Baker believes being a gentleman is more important, while I think winning the woman I love matters more. If I had been concerned about appearances and hesitated... someone as wonderful as Annie would surely have been taken by someone else. Rather than be a gentleman praised by everyone yet lose the one I love, I'd rather be considered underhanded. At least..."

He turned to me, his deep gray eyes looking directly into mine, filled wvith unwavering determination and tenderness, "when I'm lonely, the woman I love is by my side, keeping me company."

*That's why I love Howard,* I smiled inwardly, *he never hides his thoughts and feelings, always honest and direct.*

Howard's tone grew more composed. "Besides, didn't Mr. Baker just express regret about divorcing Annie?"

"You're upset because I acted too quickly,leaving you no chance?" Philip didn't deny it. "That's right!"

*Even now. all he cares about is his own gain and loss, not my happiness."I sighed inwardly. This further confirmed how right my decision to leave him had been.

Howard answered calmly. "But even if I hadn't pursued Annie, she wouldn't havre wanted to be with you."
"After all..."

"Every day she spent with you was torture."

"You never truly treated her well."

Philip wanted to argue but opened and closed his mouth without finding any rebuttal. His eyes flickered, seemingly searching for an appropriate defense, but ultimately he could only remain silent.

*Because every word Howard saysis true!* I agreed in my heart. With a few simple sentences, Howard had articulated what I had felt throughout years of marriage.

Lucy walked out of the school and ran directly to me. She looked at me curiously and asked, "Mom, why is Brian's dad at our kindergarten?"

"Does he have something to tell you?"

Lucy's appearance broke the tension among the adults. Her innocent question reminded me that in a child's world, relationships are so simple and clear.


I saw Brian also walking out of the kindergarten. Hearing Lucy's words.he quietly corrected her: "He's not my dad anymore."
###Chapter 170:Who Is Calling My Name? Lucy looked at Brian in surprise, her blue eyes filled with confusion. For a five-year-old child, understanding the complexities of adult relationships isn't easy, especially for someone like Lucy who has experienced the pain of losing her parents.
Brian said solemnly. "From now on when you see him, you can say he's Max's dad."
I looked at Brian with mixed feelings. This child had once said hurtful things to me under Sarah's influence, but he was, after all,just a child troubled by the complexities of the adult world. Seeing him now able to clearly define his family relationships, I only hoped he could take good care of himself and find his own peace amidst this adult conflict.

"Alright then." Lucy vigilantly took my hand and pulled me toward the car without looking back. "Mom, let's go home."
###Chapter 171: I Just Eanted Rverything to Be Quiet
 
Brian's POV

The moment I heard Lucy ask why "Brian's dad" was at their kindergarten.1 couldn't help but correct her: "He's not my dad anymore." I watched as the grown-ups looked a little less worried after we talked. Kids always make grown-ups feel better, I think.
Lucy grabbed Annie's hand, wanting to leave. Mr. Thompson also turned away from my dad, moving toward Annie and Lucy. I could tell they all wanted to get away from this weird situation.
I wanted to escape too, to get into the car and drive away from this mess.but Dad blocked my way. His face looked really serious, which made me scared. Lately, Dad always looked sad or angry, but this was different,and I didn't like it.

"Have you been in contact with Annie lately?" Dad asked, his voice sounding strange and tight.

I frowned. Why would he ask that? We hadn't seen Annie in forever, and he knew that. Was he thinking I was talking to her without telling him?

"No," I said. I really missed her, but she wasn't part of my life anymore.That's what grown-ups do to kids-they make big decisions that mess everything up, then expect us to be okay with it.

Dad stared at me like he didn't believe me. That look made me feel really bad. After everything, why didn't he trust me?

"She's your mother," he said, sounding mad at me. "Don't you miss her at That question made me want to cry really bad. All the sad feelings I'd been trying to hide came rushing out. Hot tears started rolling down my face, and I couldn't stop them.
"I miss her! Of course I miss her!" I shouted, crying so hard I could barely talk. "I miss her every single day! But it doesn't matter!"
I felt so angry at Dad: "Dad, you were the one who told me Sarah was better than Mom! It's all your fault!"
"I was just a little kid! I believed what you told me!"

"You made me think you were right..."

My eyes hurt from crying as Iremembered: "So I was mean to Mom...and I liked Sarah instead."

"But look what happened!"

I looked right at Dad, feeling my face get hot: "I hurt my own mom really bad! And now Mom doesn't want to forgive me anymore!"

"How can you ask if I miss her?"

"What's the point?"

"If I miss Mom, will she forgive me? Will she come back and be my mom again who loved me the most?"

"No way!"

"So why should I go see her just to feel terrible?" "I can just watch her from far away and know she's happy."

Dad's face changed. He looked shocked and then really angry. His hands made fists. For a second, I thought he might cry, but instead he looked really mad.

SLAP!

My cheek hurt so bad. Dad had hit me hard, and my face felt like it was on fire. I held my cheek and stared at him. He had never, ever hit me before. Even when I was really bad, Dad always just talked to me.
"When did you become so mean?" Dad looked at me like he didn't know me. "How can you just give up on your mother?"
I got madder than I'd ever been in my whole life. I glared at him:"You can't tell me what to do!"

"I was just a little kid who got tricked into doing bad things!"

"But I know I did wrong."

"What about you?"

"You left Mom and me..."


"And now you're sorry."


I laughed, but it sounded weird: "I think Mom would rather you stay away instead of bothering her and saying you love her now."

"Philip Baker, you're really selfish."

"When you were married to Mom, you never loved her like she wanted." "After the divorce, you won't leave her alone."

"You only care about what you want."

"Mom's biggest mistake was probably being with you."

I climbed into the car, not caring that Dad looked really hurt. I didn't care if I hurt him-he hurt me and Mom way worse.
In the car. Mitchell looked at me in the mirror with sad eyes. He knew about our family problems even though I never told him everything.
"I don't understand Mr. Baker," Mitchell said nicely. "He said he wasn't going to take care of you anymore, so why would he hit you? He can't do that."

Mitchell understood that Annie had to leave because she was pushed too hard. He didn't blame her.

But Dad? Everything was Dad's choice. He had no right to blame anyone else.

"Because he's stupid!" I said, wiping my tears away.

"He never thinks about what will happen..."


"And when bad things happen, he gets sorry."


"But he deserves it."

I looked out the window at Dad standing there alone,looking lost and small. "We shouldn't feel bad for him."

"This is just the beginning." Through the car window. I saw Dad just standing there, like he couldn't understand what happened. As wedrove away.his face looked confused.like his whole world broke.

I knew he was probably wondering why his wife didn't want him and his son hated him.
But that wasn't my problem anymore. I closed my eyes and leaned back in the seat, trying to forget everything that just happened.
I just wanted everything to be quiet.
###Chapter 172: Only Time Would Tell

Robert's POV

"Why are you calling me?" The words came out colder than I'd intended.but I couldn't help myself. Having just ended my call with Howard Thompson and reviewing my meeting notes, seeing Sarah's name flash across my screen was the last thing I expected.
Her voice sounded different-softer, almost vulnerable. The sharp edge that had cut me so deeply during our last conversation was gone.
"Robert. I just heard you went to Howard Technologies today," she said,her tone carrying a hesitation I rarely heard from her.
I immediately tensed. How could she possibly know about this? I had only left Howard's office a few hours ago.
"How did you know that?" I asked, suspicion rising within me.

"That doesn't matter," she answered quickly, with an undercurrent of anxiety in her voice. "I have my ways."

I fell silent as suddenly everything became clear. Of course, it all made sense. Howard inviting me to his office happened right after I told him about Sarah's plan to release doctored footage of me and Annie. This wasn'
t just about my project-Howard was using me to distract Sarah, to divert her attention away from Annie.

This realization should have angered me, being used as a pawn in someone else's game. But strangely, I felt a twinge of admiration for Howard's strategy. Besides, he was offering a genuine funding opportunity for my project. If he wanted to kill two birds with one stone, who was I to complain?

"Yes, I did," I finally answered, deliberately keeping my voice casual. "We discussed business opportunities."
"Oh?" Her interest was immediately piqued. "Howard thinks highly of you?



I chose my words carefully: "He was impressed with my project proposal.He's providing funding and resources to get it off the ground."
The silence that followed was loaded with calculation. I could almost hear the gears turning in her mind, reassessing my value now that Howard Thompson deemed me worth investingin.
"I'm sorry," she finally said, the words so unexpected I nearly dropped my phone. In all our years together, Sarah had rarely apologized for anything.
"I was too harsh with you the other day," she continued, her voice growing softer. "Pregnancy hormones have made me emotional and irrational. I said things I didn't mean."

I leaned back in my chair, closing my eyes. The timing was too convenient,her change of heart too sudden. Just days ago during that phone call, she had been venomous, spitting fire. The call had ended abruptly, and my attempts to call back went unanswered. She had rejected me utterly then,clearly wanting nothing more to do with me. And now that Howard had shown interest in my business, she was suddenly gentle and apologetic?

"Robert? Are you still there?" she asked when I didn't respond.

"I'm here," I said flatly. "If you called to apologize, don't bother.We're done, Sarah. You made your feelings quite clear the other day." "No," she responded quickly. "Robert, do you remember that suimmer we spent in the Hamptons? When Max was just three?"
The memory surfaced unbidden-a perfect weekend away from the city.Max building sandcastles on the beach while Sarah and I watched from under an umbrella, her head resting on my shoulder. It was one of those rare moments when everything felt right, when we truly felt like a family.
"We were happy then. weren't we?" she prompted gently.

"We had good times," I grudgingly admitted, hating how easily she could pull me back into the past.
"We could have that again," she said sofly. "This pregnancy... it's made me realize what's important. Family, Robert. You, me, Max, and this baby."
I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to block out the picture she was painting."Sarah, you made yourself very clear a few days ago. You said you never loved me."

"I was angry and scared," she insisted. "Pregnant and alone, watching you struggle after the bankruptcy. I lashed out. But this child deserves better,doesn't it? Better than parents who can't even speak to each other."

I remained silent, wrestling with the conflicting emotions her words stirred up. Part of me-the part that hadn't stopped loving her despite everything-desperately wanted to believe her. And another part,hardened by pain, recognized the manipulation.

"Robert?" Her voice caught slightly. "There's someone who wants to talk to you."

Before I could protest, I heard movement on the other end of the line,and then a familiar small voice that immediately tightened mv chest. 
"Dad?" Max's voice was tentative,uncertain.

"Hey, buddy," I said, my own voice suddenly thick. "How are you?"

"1 miss you," he said simply, and the words hit me like a physical blow."Mom says you might come home. Is that true?"
I swallowed hard. "Max, it's... it's complicated, buddy."

"But why?" His confusion was evident. "Don't you want to be with us anymore? Don't you want to be my dad anymore?"
"Max, I will always be your dad," I assured him quickly. "Nothing could ever change that."
"Then why can't we be together? Like before?" His voice wobbled dangerously. "I want us to be a family again. With the new baby too."

I felt something crack inside me-the protectve shell I'd built around my heart since the bankruptcy, since Sarah's rejection. Max had always been the innocent party in all of this, caught between parents who couldn't make it work.

"Can we, Dad? Please?" he pleaded, and I could hear the tears he was holding back.

There was movement on the other end of the line, and Sarah came back on."He misses you terribly," she said softly. "We both do."

"Sarah, this isn't fair," I said quietly, my resistance crumbling. "Using Max like this..."

"I'm not using him," she countered. "He asked to speak to you when he heard me on the phone with you. He wants our family back together as much as I do."

1 rubbed my face with my free hand, feeling trapped. Howard's proposition could transform my career. If Sarah and I could somehow make things work again, Max would regain his family,and the new baby would have both parents from the start.
But could I trust her? After everything that had happened, after the things she'd said?

"Robert." her voice was barely above a whisper. "This is your child I'm carrying. If for no other reason, please give us another chance for the baby's sake."

Silence stretched between us as I wrestled with the decision. In the end,my heart overruled my head.
"Alright," I finally said, the word feeling both like surrender and hope."We can try again."

After hanging up, I didn't know if I'd just made the biggest mistake of my life or taken the first step toward rebuilding everything. Only time would tell.
###Chapter 173: Don't Come to Me with These Trivial Matters
Philip's POV

My phone rang, shattering the heavy silence of my apartment. Seeing my mother Betty's name flash across the screen, I felt a surge of anger rise within me. Damn it! The last thing I needed right now was her nagging.I rubbed my temples vigorously, yet stilI answered the call.
"Philip, are you busy right now?" My mother's voice carried that famihar urgency that had often preceded her complaints throughout my life.
"What is it? Just tell me." I answered through gritted teeth, struggling to remain at the edge of emotional control.
Yesterday's scene cut through my mind like a knife, repeatedly stabbing at my heart. Annie standing there, her gaze calm yet resolute, completely shattering all my fantasies of starting over. And Brian-God, my own son!The contempt in his eyes hurt more than Annie's rejection.Every word he threw at me felt like a slap across my face: "You never asked what she needed."


I wanted to argue, to defend myself, but in that moment, I suddenly understood the terrible truth: he was right. What I had called love was nothing but selfish taking. That five-year-old child understood true love better than I ever had.

Each time I recalled Annie taking Lucy's hand and walking away with Howard without looking back, my heart felt like it was being torn apart.I hated Sarah for her lies and manipulation, but I hated myself more for my stupidity and cowardice. The most ridiculous part was that only after etely losing Annie did I understand how precious she truly was.
"You have no idea how impossible Brian is being!" My mother began her litany of complaints. "I went to his house last night to see him. He wouldn't welcome me or let me in, which was bad enough, but what was truly outrageous..." Her voice grew sharper, more indignant. "He actually allowed Ruth Miller to insult me!"

I listened as she whimpered through her description: "Ruth spoke so horribly to me, with such a terrible temper, she even tried to hit me..."
"And what exactly did you say when you went totheir house?"I deliberately slowed my speech, curious to hear her explanation.
"I didn't do anything," my mother quickly responded, the feigned innocence in her tone far too deliberate.
"That's impossible." I contradicted her directly, not believing a word.After much reflection recently, I'd realized that both my mother and Sarah's statements had been full of holes. Yet at the time, I had trusted these so-called loved ones, this so-called first love, unconditionally. And then I'd gone after Annie on their behalf.

"Do you think I'm some kind of fool?" I asked coldly. "That no matter how outlandish your lies,I'll believe them?"

Looking back, the ridiculous truth was that I had indeed been that stupid.

"How can you think of me that way?" My mother's voice was filled with disbelief.

"I've interacted with Ruth Miller before. Even when I said I wouldn't raise Brian anymore, she never spoke excessively harshly to me." I continued.In my daily interactions with Annie. I'd clearly seen she wasn' t the nerso0 Cme to Me with These Trivial Matters
they had described. Why had I believed their provocations?

I once again recognized my own stupidity. lowering my eyelids to hide the complex emotions in my eyes. "She simply disdained to deal with me. lf you're truly not lying, they should both have been too disgusted to communicate with you. They wouldn't have wasted time causing you trouble."

Connecting this to recent social media activity I'd seen,I revealed the truth directly: "If I'm not mistaken, you tried to provoke Margaret Thompson into bullying Annie and failed. What's more, Margaret posted the video of your instigation on social media..." I paused, allowing her to digest this fact. "So you were humiliated and angry, but too afraid to confront Margaret, so you took it out on Brian instead? Unfortunately,Ruth happened to be at Brian's house, and loving her grandson, she couldn't bear to see him being scolded by you, so she stood up for him?"

"How did you know?" My mother's voice became shrill. "Were you standing there watching when all this happened? Why didn't you help me?



I gripped the phone tightly, my knuckles turning white from the pressure.How absurd! She hadn't shown the slightest awareness of her own wrongdoing, but instead blamed me for not helping her! This inverted logic made my chest tighten with frustration.

"Philip Baker, I am your mother!" Her voice rose by several octaves. "What kind of son stands by watching his own mother being bullied without doing anything?"

I took a deep breath, trying to suppress the anger churning inside me.What a familiar routine! It was exactly this kind of emotional manipulation that had led me to blindly believe all her slander against
Annie. How could I have been so stupid?

"I guessed all of this," my voice was ice-cold but trembling slightly."Sof guessed correctly,didn't 1?"
Silence fell on the other end of the line. Her silence proved my suspicions more effectively than any denial could have. In this moment, I felt a strange sense of release, as if years of fog had finally cleared.
"Mom. I'mn very busy right now." My tone was calm but firm, though my heart was turbulent. "In the future, please don't come to me with these trivial matters."

Without waiting for her response, I hung up. Setting down the phone,I felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me. The reflection of these past days had allowed me to see the true faces of those around me, including my mother. Unfortunately, this awakening had come too late.
###Chapter 174: At Least I'm Free Tonight

Catherine's POV

Quitting time finally arrived! I practically sprinted to tidy up my desk.shutting down my computer at lightning speed. The moment my marketing proposal report finished saving and the screen went black. I wanted to cheer out loud. Since joining into this new division last month.this was my first chance to leave right at five o'clock.

Just as I was stealthily slinging my Chanel bag over my shoulder.Susan Moore appeared in my office doorway, motioning to me. I immediately raised a finger to my lips in a "shush" gesture, then tiptoed over to her side.


"Run!" I whispered, grabbing Susan's wrist and pulling her toward the elevators. "Mr. Richardson is looking for me! I just saw him scanning the hallway like a wolf hunting for prey."

Susan allowed herself to be dragged along, asking curiously, "What does he want with you?"

"What else?" I rolled my eyes, quickening my pace. "Our department just wrapped up the quarterly project, and I can finally catch my breath. He definitely wants to assign me something new. I bet that folder he's carrying has at least a week's worth of work in it!"

We rounded a corner inthe hallway, and I abruptly stopped, peeking back.Mr. Richardson was indeed carrying a thick stack of files, heading straight toward my office.

"Oh my God, look at that pile!" I shook my head dramatically. "If he finds me, my weekend is completely ruined. I'll have to cancel the Broadway show Molly invited me to."

Susan couldn't help but laugh. "You know you'll have to deal with that work eventually,right?"


"But not today!" I said with exaggerated seriousness,then lowered my voice to mimic Richardson's all-business tone: "Miss Morgan, working weekends is essential for career advancement. You should feel honored."

Susan laughed even harder as we hid around the corner like a pair of high school students skipping class.

"Let's go!" I pulled Susan into the elevator as the doors opened. "Perfect timing! Our salvation arrives!"

As the elevator doors closed, I dramatically wiped non-existent sweat from my forehead and took a deep breath.

"Safe at last!"

Susan looked at me, amused. "Are you sure this is a good idea? He'll definitely catch you tomorrow."


"Tomorrow's problems are for tomorrow's Catherine," I winked. "The word 'overtime' doesn't exist in Catherine Morgan's dictionary."

The elevator reached the ground floor, and we exited the building. I glanced around, then pointed to the coffee shop inside the corporate building. "Let's go there. I have gossip to share, and I need some sugar to celebrate my narrow escape."

"Good idea," Susan nodded in agreement. "But I'm ordering coffee.I need the caffeine." "Workaholic." I teased. "Still thinking about staying energized after hours."

At the cafe, we found a quiet corner. Susan ordered regular coffee,while I chose strawberry juice. When the server brought Susan's coffee,the bitter aroma wafted over, making me wrinkle my nose. Even just smelling it.f could imagine the bitterness spreading across my tongue. I quickly took two large gulps of my juice to wash away the imagined taste.
"God. I don't understand you coffee enthusiasts," I said. "How can you drink something so bitter?"
Susan just smiled and sipped her coffee with obvious enjoyment. "It's a sign of adulthood,dear."
I made a face, then looked around to ensure no one was within earshot.Only after confirming we were safe did I lean forward and lower my voice.


Susan's expression immediately turned serious. "A mole? Why do you say that?"

"You know I've never publicly disclosed which project team I'm on,right?I've always kept a low profile."

Susan nodded in agreement.

"But somehow," I frowned, "Bill White knows I've been making good money lately. He's been sticking to me like glue every single day."

I sighed and continued, "I've been trying to avoid him, but he always manages to find me precisely, then performs his pitiful one-man show right in front of me."

"What did he say?" Susan asked. curiosity sparkling in her eyes. "He claimed he was starving and asked me for money to buy food."1rolled my eyes. "And being the kind-hearted person I am. I couldn't just watch a living, breathing human being starve in front of me,right?"

"Of course not." Susan nodded earnestly.

"So I took ten dollars from my wallet and,gave it to him, telling him to buy something to eat." I spread my hands. "Guess what he said? He actually complained it wasn't enough for a meal!"

"Really?"

"I asked how much he needed, and he said-twenty thousand dollars!"My eyes widened as I emphasized the number with an exaggerated tone."My God! His father kicked him out, he's basically homeless, yet he still maintains these princely spending expectations!"

At this point. I paused, my thoughts drifting to the past. I had to admit.before I started working, my spending habits weren't much better. With my father's support, I could splurge on shopping and entertainment without ever considering the value of money. Dad never scolded me, just kept fulfilling my requests. Honestly, I had no idea then how hard it was to earn money.

Now working at Howard Technologies, despite the decent salary, I was beginning to realize that my entire month's paycheck might not cover what I used to spend in a single shopping trip. Only now did I truly understand how difficult it was to earn money, which had made me much more economical.


"He's really shameless," Susan commented, pulling me back to reality.

"Exactly!" I responded enthusiastically.′′told him directly that he wasasking for a month's salary in one go, which was ridiculous, and I couldn't possibly give him that."
I truly couldn't understand how Bill could be so thick-skinned. I gave him ten dollars out of the kindness of my heart because I was afraid he might starve, but I didn't love him or want to support him. Why couldn't he understand this simple fact?
"Then what? What did he say?" Susan pressed.

My expression grew more cautious. "He said I was earning much more from my work than I was admitting."
"I couldn't acknowledge that, of course,so I told him that salaries at Howard Technologies weren't as high as he imagined," I recalled the conversation. "And guess what he said next?"
Susan's eyes lit up. "What?"

"He said," I deliberately slowed my pace to ensure Susan heard clearly,"that my current project is extremely successful and profitable."

Susan's expression also turned serious. "Your project's sales have indeed been exceptional these past few days, breaking company records."

"Yes,now everyone knows this project is making money," she thoughtfully added. "And Mr. Howard is generous-he'll definiely give your team a good share. If Bill has been following this project, he could certainly guess you've earned quite a bit."

I didn't deny this point, but what I really cared about was: "But how did he know I was responsible for this project? That's the key question."

Susan frowned, seeming to search her memnory. "Come to think of it,I think I saw him a few days ago when I was returning from an external meeting."
"Really?" I immediately leaned forward, almost in Susan's face."Where?"

"I remember he was chatting with Caroline Gluck," Susan said after a moment's hesitation. "Though I was too fat away to hear what they were saying."


"Caroline?" I considered this possibility. "Could she have told him?"

Susan shrugged. "I can't be certain, but since you saw them together, it's certainly possible."
"Well, I'll ask her tomorrow," I decided.

"Good idea," Susan encouraged.

"You really are the company's biggest gossip queen!" I sincerely admired."
You always manage to capture all the key information. You should be a detective instead of a secretary."

Susan's face showed a hint of shyness. "It's nothing special, just paying attention."

"Too modest," I said with a smile, then took a sip of juice as my thoughts returned to Bill, my eyes inadvertently revealing contempt.

"What are you thinking about?" Susan keenly noticed my change in expression.

"I just think Bill is so shameless!" I said without hesitation. "There's absolutely nothing between us, yet he has the audacity to ask me for money, and when I gave him some, he complained it wasn't enough and demanded more."

I grew increasingly angry as I spoke. "Even if I really did earn a lot of money,so what? Does that mean I should give it to him?I don't owe him anything!"

"Absolutely right," Susan also expressed indignation. "His own father stopped supporting him, yet he comes to you saying he's learned his lesson and expects you to support him..."
"As if life could be that easy!" She shook her head. "Don't you find it ridiculous?"

"Extremely ridiculous!" I confirmed emphatically.

"Besides," Susan continued, "I believe men shouldn't take money from women."

I had some reservations about this point. "I can buy meals for my friends,and they can buy meals for me. That's normal. But Bill isn't my friend-he's someone I absolutely can't stand. Yet he expects me to finance his luxurious lifestyle? He's dreaming!"

Just as our conversation was heating up, my phone vibrated. Glancing at the screen, I was horrified to see a message from Mr. Richardson.

"Oh no!" I exclaimed softly. "It's Mr. Richardson. He says the first thing tomorrow morning, he wants to meet with me to discuss the new project!"

"See? There's no escape," Susan said with a smile.

I sighed but quickly recovered. "Well, at least I'm free tonight. Come on,let'
s get some dessert to celebrate my 'temporary freedom!"
###Chapter 175: Mom, Why Doesn't the Mmoo Fall Down?
Annie's POV

After a long day at work and a brief workout session, I savored this rare moment of tranquility in our home.

Lucy and Penny had gone upstairs to play under the watchful eyes of Lucy's grandparents, while Sue Peterson and I settled in the living room,discussing tomorrow's performance at the Upper East Side Priváte Preschool.

"I heard from Penny that Lucy has a performance tomorrow too?" Sue asked. a warm smile brightening her face.
"Yes," I replied, feeling my lips automatically curve upward at the mention of Lucy. "She'll be the little host for their class présentation. I can't wait to see her. No matter how busy things get, I'll definitely make time to be at school for her performance."

As I spoke, I imagined Lucy standing on stage, her sky-blue eyes wide with excitement, golden curls shimmering under the spotlight. "I need to bring my camera to capture every precious moment."

Sue's expression softened. "Penny has a part in the performance too. To be honest, sometimes I worry I'm spoiling her too much-always taking time off work to see her performances, wanting to document every little detail."

She paused, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "But after getting to know you, I've realized I'm not alone-all parents who truly love their children are like this." I nodded with a gentle laugh. "Exactly. The truth is, our children will only stay with us for ten, maybe fifteen years. If we don't cherish this time and record these moments. when they grow up and leave, we'll find we have nothing left but memories. That feeling must be incredibly lonely."
My thoughts drifted involuntarily to my marriage with Philip. Before meeting Howard. I had thought Philip was good enough for me-he was wealthy, handsome, from a good family. But it wasn't until after experiencing that painful betrayal and meeting Howard,someone who truly respected and understood me, that I realized my standards had been far too low.

Sue seemed to be reflecting on her own life choices. "Before joining Howard's company, I was too easily swayed by pretty promises and too willing to let work consume all my time. I thought that since the company treated me well. I should devote myself entirely to work, with family and my daughter coming second."

Her words resonated deeply with me. "And then you suddenly realized that's not how life should be.right?"

She nodded, her eyes sparkling with new clarity. "Exactly. After joining Howard's company, I had an awakening. Making money is important,but enjoying life is more so. We earn money to make life better, not to sacrifice life entirely for work."

"If we neglect our children and miss their growing years," I said softly,"what's the point of earning all that money? When we look back and find our children have become people we barely know, that regret will follow us for the rest of our lives,"

"Tm glad I woke up in time," Sue said, her expression relaxing. "I brought Penny to live with me and found a job with more humanity. Howard's company is truly different-it allows employees to balance work and family."
We exchanged knowing smiles, both understanding that those difficult days were behind us. Now we had new lives, and everything was moving in a positive direction.

At nine o'clock. Penny finally came downstairs, reluctant to leave. She held Sue's hand as they said their goodbyes.
I stood at the door, watching until their car disappeared around the corner before turning to take Lucy's small hand and head upstairs.
Lucy's hand felt warm and soft in mine, like a small bird that trusted me completely. All the way up the stairs, she chattered enthusiastically about her adventures with Penny, her blue eyes sparkling, golden curls swaying gently with each animated movement.

"...and then Penny said she wants to be an actress when she grows up, she's always wanted to be an actress," Lucy explained as we walked, her expression utterly serious, as if this were the mnost important topic in the world. "I told her I want to be a scientist because you can invent lots of interesting things. Mom, do you think it's better to be an actress or a scientist?"


I considered how to answer this unexpected question. "I think whether it's being an actress or a scientist, as long as it's what you love, that's the best choice. Every profession hasits own unique charm."

Lucy seemed satisfied with this answer, nodding immediately before changing the subject: "Penny says I'll do great in my performance tomorrow because I've memorized all my lines!"
As we reached Lucy's bedroom door. I paused. "Speaking of tomorrow's performance, has our little host decided what she's going to wear?"
Lucy tilted her head, her big eyes blinking adorably in a way that melted my heart. "I haven't decided yet."
"Luckily, Howard bought you many beautiful dresses," I said. opening her closet door to reveal an array of neatly hung dresses in various colors and styles. "Let's see which one would be best for tomorrow's performance."

"Yay!" Lucy jumped with excitement before quickly composing herself into what she apparently thought was a mature pose, making me struggle not to laugh.

She carefully took out a pink puffy dress from the closet and solemnly asked for my opinion: "Mom, how about this one?"

Rather than immediately giving my assessment, I encouraged her: "Why don't you try it on? After you're wearing it, we can decide together."

Lucy nodded, closing the bedroom door to change. Shortly after, she stood before the mirror in the pink dress, seriously examining herself as she turned from side to side. She furrowed her little brow and shook her head."No,this one won't do."

Before I could comment, she had already quickly removed the pink dress and picked up a light blue one. Watching her methodically try on each outfit, I couldn't help but smile. It felt like playing a real-life dress-up game,with Lucy offering her unique commentary on each garment:

"This one's too sparkly,"

"This one isn't princess enough." "This color isn't special enough"...

Finally, she paused at a white princess dress. It had delicate lace trim and small pearl decorations, simple yet elegant. Lucy put it on and twirled in front of the mirror again and again, her little face radiating undisguised joy.
"Mom,what do you think of this dress?",she turned to me. blue eyes shimmering with anticipation.
Instead of answering directly. I asked her: "Do you like it?"

Lucy nodded vigorously, her golden curls bouncing with the movement."I do. Mom. I really, really do! It makes me feel like a real host!"
Hearing her answer. I felt a wave of warmth flow through my heart.Growing up. few people had genuinely cared about my opinions. My mother loved me, but the hardships of life left her little time for such details. And Philip, even at his best, rarely truly asked what I thought.

"Then we'll wear this dress tomorrow," I smiled, admiring how she looked in the white dress. It truly suited her, highlighating her angelic features."Howard and I will try to get to the preschool early tomorrow afternoon to help you with your hair,okay?"

When Lucy heard this news, her face immediately lit up with a brilliant smile. She rushed into my arms like a whirlwind, her small arms wrapping tightly around me. "You're the best, Mom! I love you!"

I gently stroked her soft hair, feeling infinite tenderness rising in my heart."I love you too, Lucy. Very,very much."

With preparations complete, Lucy obediently climbed into bed and tucked herself under the covers. I sat beside her and, as usual, began reading her bedtime story in a soft voice. Lucy listened attentively, occasionally asking urprisingly insightful questions.
"Mom,why doesn't the moon fall down?"

"Do stars have mommies too?"

"If I forget my lines tomorrow,will the audience laugh at me?"

I patiently answered each question, no matter how strange or complex.
When I finished the story and saw Lucy's eyelids growing heavy. I leaned down to kiss her forehead.
"Goodnight, my little angel. Tomorrow will be a wonderful day."

"Goodnight. Mom," she mumbled, already half-asleep. "I love you..."


I gently turned off the bedside lamp and lingered at the doorway for a moment. gazing at this little girl who had brought infinite light to my life.

Glancing at my watch, I saw it was already past ten. Howard had been working in his study since we'd returned from the preschool with Lucy.He should probably take a break too, I thought.

I decided to check on him and confirm whether he could make time for Lucy's performance tomorrow. Howard always kept his word.

I placed my hand on the doorknob and took a deep breath, preparing to knock.
###Chapter 176:Together?

Howard's POV

I sat in my study, engrossed in a stack of reports and partnership agreements when my phone vibrated. It was a message from Susan.I glanced at it, and found my lips curving upward involuntarily.
"Mr. Thompson, Annie's signing session at the printing factory has been completed. According to feedback from the publishers, pre-orders have exceeded expectations, and signed editions have completely sold out."
I set aside the document in my hand. The news was even better than anticipated.
Susan followed up with another message:


"The publisher has already shared the news on social media, and the response has been enthusiastic. Sarah Johnson will definitely see this. As you predicted, she's likely to imitate this marketing approach."

I gave a cold laugh. Sarah's behavior was so predictable.She had been quiet lately, but I knew she wouldn't give up so easily. Still, letting her busy herself with copying Annie's marketing strategy was beneficial-it would distract her for a while, keeping her temporarily away from Annie and Lucy's lives.

As I contemplated the next preventive measures, a gentle knock sounded at my study door.

"Come in." I said, setting down my phone.

It was Annie. She wore a simple navy blue dress that accentuated her slender figure. After a full day's activities, her hair was slightly disheveled. merr
triggering an image in my mind- her beneath me,breathless,hair scattered across the pillow.

"Am I disturbing you?" she asked, her voice carrying thatunique blend of confidence and consideration that I had come to appreciate.

"Not at all," I answered, setting aside the documents I'd been reviewing."I could use a break."

Annie stepped in, casually closing the door behind her. "I wanted to confirm that you'll be able to make it to Lucy's performance tomorrow afternoon? She's really looking forward to it."

I nodded without hesitation. "Of course. I've cleared my schedule from noon onwards. Lucy's performance is my top priority."

Annie's face brightened with visible relief. "That's wonderful. I just tucked Lucy into bed-you should have seen how seriously she took choosing her outfit. She tried on almost every dress in her closet before deciding on that white dress with the pearl decorations."

"The one with the lace trim?" I asked, recalling the dress I had selected for Lucy last month.

"That's the one. She said it makes her feel like 'a real host," Annie chuckled, making air quotes with her fingers.

I smiled,imagining Lucy's serious little face making that declaration. "She'Il be perfect."

Annie moved closer, perching on the edge of my desk. "She asked some interesting questions tonight."

"Oh? What kind?" "She wanted to know why the moon doesn't fall down," Annie replied, her eyes sparkling with amusement. "And if stars have mothers too."
I chuckled lightly. "Our Lucy is quite the little philosopher."

"She's curious about everything." Annie agreed, her gaze falling on the pile of documents on my desk. "You've been working late a lot this week. Is everything alright with the company?"
"Just the usual challenges." I answered, deliberately keeping my tone light.There was no need for Annie toknow I was closely monitoring Sarah's every move.
"Actually," I changed the subject, "I heard your book signing was quite successful today. Congratulations."
Annie's face immediately lit up with pride. "It was incredible. I still can't believe how many people were waiting in line for a signature."

"I'm not surprised at all," I said sincerely. "Your talent deserves recognition. It was just a matter of time."

Annie looked at me curiously. "And by the way, the flowers you sent at lunch were beautiful,thank you."

I smiled. "Of course I need to stay informed about my girlfriend's achievements."

"You're always so thoughtful," Annie's eyes shone with warmth.She glanced at the pile of documents on my desk, then back at me. "Always working so late."

"Today is an exception," I reached out to take her hand, noticing the slight redness around her wrist. "Your hand must be tired from signing so many books."

"A little," she admitted. flexing her fingers. "But it's a good kind of tired."

I gently pulled her toward me. gesturing for her to move from the desk to my lap. After a moment's hesitation, she complied, sighing contentedly as she leaned against me. The warmth of her hody and the faint scent of lilac brought me a sense of peace.

"How about we go out to the balcony?" I suggested. "Get some fresh air?"

Annie nodded, and I led her to the private balcony connected to my study.The night sky stretched above us, clear and star-filled. The soft glow of the balcony lights created a warm bubble around us, insulating us from the darkness outside and the noise of the city.
We settled into comfortable chairs, and I took her hand again, gently massaging her palm and wrist to ease the tension from hours of writing.

"Do you need to sign more books tomorrow?" I asked.

"No, I finished everything today," she answered, visibly relaxing under my massage. "Even if I hadn't, I would still prioritize Lucy's performance tomorrow afternoon."

I lifted her hand to my lips, placing a kiss on her palm-an unusual gesture for someone typically as reserved as myself.

Annie chuckled, pulling her hand back with a playful expression."What are you doing?" she asked, though her eyes revealed her pleasure at the gesture.

"It's been longs since we were apart," I admitted honestly, my voice lower than usual. "A whole day without seeing you. I found I didn't particularly 
enjoy the feeling. I missed you. Annie."

The night sky seemed to still around us, my words hanging in the air.t wasn't a man accustomed to expressing emotions, but with Annie, I was gradually learning to shed the ice around my heart,to articulate my feelings.

Annie's expression softened, and she moved closer, leaning against my shoulder. "Is this better?" she asked softly.
"Much," I answered without hesitation, wrapping my arm around her waist as we sat in comfortable silence.
The starlight cast an enchanting glow between us, and I felt Annie's breathing begin to quicken, her body shifting subtly in my embrace.When she turned to look at me, her eyes glimmered with a light I had come to recognize.

"I missed you too, Howard," her voice became low and soft, carrying a hint of temptation I couldn't resist.

My fingers traced lightly along her back, feeling the warmth of her skin through the thin fabric. She tilted her head, looking at me with unmistakable desire in her eyes.

Annie turned, smoothly straddling my thighs in one fluid motion, her dress riding up in the process. She cradled my face in her hands and leaned down to kiss me. The kiss started gentle and exploratory but quickly became passionate and urgent.

My hands instinctively steadied her waist, feeling her body press against mine. "Here?" I asked softly in the brief pause between kisses.

"Why not?" she smiled against my lips, a mischievous glint in her eyes. "Under the stars, just the two of us..."

I couldn't resist her proposition, nor could I resist the weight and warmth of her on top of me. My hands slid to her thighs, savoring the smoothness of her skin. Annie's breathing grew more rapid, her nimble fingers skillfully unbuttoning my shirt.

She arched her back, tilting her head backward to expose her slender neck.My lips traveled from her jaw down to her collarbone, eliciting a soft sigh from her. Her fingers tangled in my hair, tugging gently, communicating her urgency.

Annie took the initiative to unzip her own dress, letting it slide down to her waist. revealing curves wrapped in black lace lingerie. Moonlight bathed her skin, enveloping her in a mysterious silver glow. I gazed at her,entranced, my palm pressed against her back,feeling every tremor in her body.

"You're beautiful," I murmured, my voice husky with desire.

She smiled at me, that confident, teasing smile that always accelerated my heartbeat. "Then prove it to me," she whispered, simultaneously unbuckling my belt.

Our movements became more urgent, clothing discarded piece by piece,scattered across the balcony floor.

Annie straddled me, her hands pressing on my shoulders as she slowly and deliberately joined with me. When I was fully inside her,she threw her head back, releasinga satisfied, uninhibited moan, a trembling tone of pleasure rolling from her throat.

She began to move, her hips swaying rhythmically, initially with slow, gemer
deep motions. I could feel every inch of warmth and tightness inside her.Her bare breasts swayed before me, full and firm, nipples hardened with excitement. I couldn't help but lean forward to take one in my mouth.teasing the sensitive tip with my tongue.

"God, Howard..." she called my name, her voice hoarse and filled with passion. "Justlike that... don't stop..."

My hands gripped her soft buttocks, my fingers pressing into her skin,guiding her to quicken her pace. Her movements became faster,more intense. Sweat trickled from her forehead and chest,glistening enticingly in the moonlight. Her waist twisted, seeking the angle that would bring us both the greatest pleasure.

The balcony chair creaked with our rhythm but was sturdy enough to bear the weight of our passion. Annie's fingers dug deep into my shoulders,her head leaning forward, hair falling around her face as our gazes locked through the haze of desire. Her eyes were half-closed, lips parted, each breath mingled with subtle moans.

Under the starry sky, in this completely private space belonging only to us,we reached our climax. Annie's body tensed, then collapsed into my embrace. I held her tightly, savoring this intimate, relaxed moment.

After a while, Annie laughed softly. "I think we might need a shower."

"I think that's an excellent idea," I replied, kissing her temple. "Together?"

"Sounds perfect."
###Chapter 177: I Can't Give Up Any of Them

Sarah's POV

News about Annie Baker's ridiculous children's book being published and "bestselling" had flooded every major platform, occupying positions on several charts. Photos circulated online showing her sitting in the printing factory, diligently signing copies, pretending to be a successful author.
Looking at that photo. I nearly laughed out loud-that expression of relief on her face, like an elementary school student who had just published their first essay. Utterly ridiculous.
I had been basking in my own victory-my merchandise pre-orders had far exceeded the sales of Annie's pathetic little picture book. Though the actual products hadn't been manufactured yet, orders were pouring in steadily. What satisfied me most was that all this money was mine alone,with not a penny to be shared with anyone else.

I had thought that aside from men, I had already crushed that housewife Annie Baker in every possible way. But when I saw her picture book appearing out of nowhere with such impressive sales, an uncontrollable rage ignited from deep within me. I clenched my jaw, my nails digging into my palms.

Why? Why was it that every time I thought I had left her in the dust,she would suddenly emerge with some"good news"?It was nothing short of mockery!

Like a detective, I scrutinized every piece of information repeatedly,trying to find evidence that this was just Annie's pitiful self-promotion. But the deeper I investigated, the more I had to admit-this damned news was real. Suddenly. I remembered the call from this afternoon.My surveillance person had informed me that Annie had spent several hours at the printing factory. She must have been busy signing her laughable picture book then! At this thoughit. my fingers unconsciously tightened around my phone.

I took a deep breath, forcing myself to calm down, and dialed the publishing house manager.
"Hello?" I tried to make my voice sound calm and elegant.

"Ms. Johnson," came the enthusiastic greeting from the other end, "how was the marketing we did for you last time? Were you satisfied?"
"Of course I was satisfied," I replied with a light laugh, certainly not telling him the truth-that marketing campaign had earned me a fortune, and even after deducting the million-dollar marketing fee,my pockets were still filled with more than satisfactory figures.

I got straight to the point: "I want to publish my picture book.Can you help me with that?"

The person on the other end immediately perked up, his voice rising by several octaves: "Of course we can! Ms. Johnson, you may have forgotten,we're a professional publishing company with abundant publishing resources. We've been looking for quality work like yours!".

"If you're interested. I can immediately send you the contact information for Melissa, who's in charge of our publishing business. You can discuss the details with her directly."

When I confirmed that my picture book could also be published, a sense of triumph surged through me. Annie Baker instantly became small and Can't Give Up Any of Them
laughable in my eyes-whatever she could do. I could naturally do too!And I would do it better!
"No problem, send it to me right away." I said. my voice filled with barely concealed joy.
A few seconds later, my phone vibrated once, and a string of numbers appeared on the screen. I saved it immediately and eagerly dialed this number.

"Hello, is this Melissa?" I tried to make my voice sound friendly yet professional.
"Yes. who am I speaking with?" came a crisp female voice from the other end.

"This is Sarah Johnson," I introduced myself concisely. "I want to publish a children's picture book. Would your company be willing to give me this opportunity?"

Melissa responded pleasantly: "Of course, Ms. Johnson. Please add me as a contact, and I'll send you a publishing plan table right away. You can see what scale of publishing service you'd like."

"Wonderful." I quickly added her as a contact.


Melissa's efficiency was satisfactory-in less than half a minute, she sent a detailed form. After carefully reviewing it, I had a better idea in mind.

"Melissa," I pretended to be contemplative, "I believe my picture book will be quite popular. How about this..."

"Oh?" Melissa's voice carried obvious curiosity. -Give Up Any of Them
I said confidently: "Whay don't you first take a look at the pre-order numbers for merchandise on my social media page? This might help you better assess the market potential of my work." Instead of directly stating how many copies I wanted to publish, I cleverly let her see my influence first.
I sent her the link to my Instagram, secretly delighted-those numbers were enough to impress any publisher.

Sure enough. Melissa was clearly stunned after looking,her voice changing pitch: "This is most impressive! Your fan base is very strong! How about this: you grant us the publishing rights to your picture book, and we'll help you publish a batch to test the market response?"

I was secretly elated. Originally, I just wanted to print more copies,as a few tens of thousands wouldn't be enough for my fans to snatch up. But hearing Melissa's suggestion, I immediately realized that I might be able to fulfill my publishing dream without fronting any costs. My smile grew even brighter: "That's an excellent idea!"

Melissa, being a seasoned publisher, naturally didn't want to take too big a risk: "However, I suggest you first put up a pre-sale link on social media to test the market response."

"Of course. no problem!" I immediately agreed, thinking this was exactly what I wanted.

"You know," Melissa sighed, "the publishing industry is fiercely competitive these days. We all need to proceed with caution."

I responded with complete confidence: "With me involved,you needn't worry about sales at all." Melissa sounded satisfied: "Very well. I'll arrange for a designer to create a beautiful cover for you. You can post it on social media to build anticipation and see your fans' reactions."
"Perfect!" I almost danced at my end of the phone.

After hanging up. I felt an unprecedented sense of satisfaction. The problem that had been troubling mefor days had finally found a solution!I was so excited I could barely sit still, my mind already beginning to construct promotional plans for when I received the cover design tomorrow.

I would find the best marketingteam and conduct bombardment-style promotions across all major platforms. No matter the cost. I was determined to make my sales exceed Annie's! Only then could I hold my head high in front of Philip and Howard, proving to them that I was more talented, more deserving of their favor than Annie.

Thinking about Annie seeing my success, that placid face of hers finally showing cracks, I felt an indescribable pleasure coursing through my veins.For me now, my career was my biggest bargaining chip. Only when my picture book gained market recognition could I earn genuine appreciation and respect from those men.

My lips unconsciously curved upward as my fingers lightly swept across my phone screen. I thought about how incredibly busy I'd been lately. I had to be versatile-stabilizing my nascent career while simultaneously placating Robert and Howard, not to mention keeping Philip, that walking "ATM," willingly spending money on me.

I sighed, wiping the smile from my face. Honestly, I sometimes wondered if I should give up one of these three men. After all, being pregnant and juggling three men simultaneously was truly exhausting. Every day involved calculating time, considering my words,paying attention to details.afraid of showing my hand... It was more tiring than work!
But on second thought: who should I give up?

Howard represented the golden key to high society, the best choice for me to soar to greater heights.
Philip, though no longer a star in the financial world,could still ensure my current lifestyle remained comfortable and worry-free.

And Robert... he was my insurance, my last resort if all other plans failed.

As for my career, it was my greatest support-even if all men left me,as long as my career flourished, I could still live the life I wanted.

So the answer was obvious: I couldn't give up any of them.

Although life might be a bit harder now, in the future, when I finally won this game, all the hardship would be worth it. The corners of my mouth turned up again, my eyes gleaming with calculation.

I opened my phone and pulled up my chat with Robert, hesitating about what to send. Earlier today, I had apologized to him over the phone,mentioning how pregnancy hormones had made me emotional and irrational, saying many things I didn't mean. I even had Max talk to him,using my child's emotions to move him.

That performance seemed to work-he agreed to give our relationship another chance, especially considering the child I was carrying.But I needed to confirm whether he had truly forgiven me, whether he had secured investment from Howard. After all, a Robert with Howard Thompson's backing would be much more valuable to me. I needed to test his attitude. Biting my lower lip, after careful consideration.
I finally typed a seemingly casual greeting:"How have you been lately?"
###Chapter 178: Complete Silence Might Be th Greatest Punishment
Robert's POV

I finally finished reviewing the project documentation and leaned back in mmy chair. Since Howard had decided to hire a few employees for my new venture, my workload had become considerably more manageable.

Just as I took a moment to rest, my phone vibrated and I saw Sarah Johnson's name appear.

"How have you been lately?"

I recalled our last conversation. She had apologized with what seemed like genuine remorse, blaming pregnancy hormones for making her emotional and irrational. When Max got on the phone saying he missed me,my heart softened.I had forgiven her-after all, she was carrying our child.

My partnership with Howard had given me renewed hope. Perhaps this was our chance to rebuild our family? I replied in a gentle tone:

"Doing well, keeping busy."

Sarah's response came almost immediately: "That's good to hear. Do you need anything?"

I felt a touch of warmth at her concern.′′NO,thank you for asking."

She seemed uncertain about my somewhat measured response and tentatively wrote back: "You still sound a bit distant."

Then she continued: "Have you really forgiven me? I truly want to reconcile. Max asks about you every day, wondering when you'll come see him... and," she paused briefly. "I'm carrying your child. Robert. We should start over for our children's sake."

These words triggered a deep sense of responsibility within me. I had indeed forgiven her and wanted to create a stable environment forour children. I honestly replied: "Yes. I have forgiven you. I've just been extremely busy. The new project requires my full attention."
"When you have some free time, could we talk properly? Maybe have lunch together?" she asked, her tone hopeful.
I hesitated, then agreed: "Sure,once things slow down a bit."

Placing my phone down, I tried to refocus on work, but Sarah's words lingered in my thoughts. I genuinely was busy, but I also wanted to repair our relationship. Seeing her take the initiative to make amends gave me a sense of relief. Perhaps we could truly start over for the children?

A few minutes later,, my other phone rang. It was the dedicated phone Howard had given me, used to communicate with Sarah on his behalf.Howard had made it clear that he didn't want direct contact with Sarah,yet needed to stay informed about her activities. So he had me create a private account in his name, through which I would interact with Sarah while pretending to be him.

I picked up that phone andI saw Sarah had sent "Howard" a message: "Busy handling work matters?"

I felt confused. Even as she was expressing her desire to rebuild our family,she was simultaneously reaching out to Howard? Maybe it was just business? After all, Sarah's brand promotion had begun, and she might be seeking Howard's business advice. I decided to respond as Howard to see what she wanted: "Yes, just finished dealing with some paperwork. Did you need something?"
Sarah quickly replied: "Nothing in particular, just thinking about you...I figured you might be working late again. Always pushing yourself so hard.it must be exhausting."

The tone immediately put me on alert. This clearly wasn't a business inquiry, but rather some kind of flirtatious probe. I forced myself to remain calm andI continued: "Company matters are quite demanding."

"You know." Sarah continued, "sometimes I think a successful man like you needs someone who truly understands your pressure. Not just an ordinary partner, but someone who can support you in both work and life."

I felt a wave of discomfort. These words were too familiar-they were exactly what she had once said to me when we were falling in love. Now she was using the same approach with Howard. Still, I controlled my emotions and replied: "Thank you for your concern,but I'm currently with Annie and Lucy."

Sarah's response slowed, as if she was carefully choosing her words: "Oh,that's nice... Annie seems like a decent person."

This was immediately followed by another message: "To be honest though,I'm a bit surprised you two have gotten so close. You and she... are quite different in style."

I frowned, replying: "What do you mean?"

Sarah seemed to have been waiting for this question: "You know, Howard.You're the kind of strong, decisive, successful person who needs a partner who helps you shine. I'm not saying Annie isn't good, just that...her presence is too weak, like a shadow. That's not what you deserve."

My heart rate accelerated. Her words carried hidden meanings, her tone increasingly blatant. Another message came through: "I wonder if you really know about what happened between Annie and Philip? As a friend.I feel I should tell you some things."
I cautiously replied: "What things?"

Sarah answered: "Philip was actually quite terrible to her, often ignoring her feelings. But strangely. Annie never complained,instead becoming dependent on him." After a brief pause, she added: "Personally,I think you need someone who can speak to you as an equal, who understands your ambition, shares your success... not someone who just clings to you."

Everything became crystal clear-Sarah wasn't just smearing Annie,she was trying to seduce Howard. Just minutes ago, she had told me I was her only true love, and now she was attempting to attract another man.

A deep sense of betrayal washed over me, accompanied by an unusual clarity.

She continued sending messages: "If you ever want someone to talk to, or just to relax... I'm always available. We could meet privately, no one would know." Her suggestion couldn't have been more obvious.

She sent another: "I feel there's a special connection between us, Howard.I've feIt it since the first time we met, don't you think?"

I felt a surge of anger, but more than that, disappointment in myself. Just ten minutes earlier, I had been seriously considering rebuilding a family with this woman, trying to make it work "for the children." And now, she was unhesitatingly flirting with another man, even suggesting private  while simultaneously disparaging a woman she barely knew.
All the tender feelings I had harbored for Sarah completely froze.She hadn't returned to me for love or family-she saw that my partnership with Howard was gaining momentum and thought I might once again become a valuable "resource."

In that moment. I fully understood why Howard had set up this test. He had seen through Sarah's true nature long ago, while I remained blind to it.Ironically. it was only now that I realized I wasn't the only one being manipulated-she was simultaneously playing me, Philip, and Howard,gauging who could provide her with the greatest benefit.

I forced myself to calm down. I needed to continue playing Howard's role.
I replied:

"I know Annie much better than you think."

Sarah immediately tried to backpedal: "I'm not saying Annie isn't good,Howard. I just think you should know all the circumstances before making decisions. After all, you deserve the best."

"And what is the best?" I countered, "Someone like you? Someone who maintains ambiguous relationships with multiple men while badmouthing others behind their backs?"

Sarah seemed shocked by my directness, quickly becoming defensive:"What are you talking about? I just care about you..."

"Only a fool like Philip would believe your fabricated stories," I replied,"Or did you think everyone would be deceived by your low-quality attempts at sowing discord?"

Sarah immediately became earnest: "Am I wrong in what I said? I really  am just looking out for you."

"Why don't you trust me?"

"I'm not lying... I just..."

I put down the phone, no longer responding. I felt an unprecedented emptiness and exhaustion. Ten minutes ago. I had been delighted at the possibility that Sarah might genuinely be remorseful. Now I understood it was all just part of her carefully woven web of lies.
I looked at my own phone, still displaying Sarah's earlier message.Reading those words now. I only felt nauseous: "...you're the only man I've ever truly loved... I hope we can start fresh."
I almost laughed. She could profess "true love" to two different men within minutes of each other. Wasn't this some kind of pathology?

I hesitated, wondering if I should tell her I had seen through everything.But I realized this was exactly what she wanted-to provoke an emotional response, drawing me into her game. No, I wouldn't give her that satisfaction. Complete silence might be the greatest punishment.
###Chapter 179: I Always Keep My Options Op
Sarah's POV

I hurled my phone onto the sofa, gritting my teeth in fury. Damn Howard Thompson! I had used every trick in my arsenal to get close to him, but he had actually rejected me! Never before had a man been so resolute in saying "no" to me.

The more Howard refused me, the more determined I became to have him.His coldness ignited an even stronger desire for conquest within me. If I pursued him persistently enough, surely he would eventually waver.

Just then, my phone vibrated. It was Robert.

"Too busy with work this week to meet. Comnpany restructuring requires my full attention."

I frowned. Robert was supposed to be my safety net, especially after I told him I was carrying his child. But now he was avoiding me,clearly still angry about our last argument.

I stared at the three conversation threads: Howard showing zero interest in me. Robert being distant and cold, and Philip-whomn I hadn't contacted in days.

I narrowed my eyes. Philip Baker, my personal ATM. He was always so easy to manipulate.

I picked up my phone and dialed Philip's number directly.

"Hello?" I greeted in a sugary voice, as if there had never been any problems between us."What do you want?" Philip's tone was surprisingly cold, catching me off guard.
I quickly adjusted my strategy. "I just wanted to update you on how I'm using your investment," I said, keeping my voice professionally steady despite the internal warning bells. Why was this man suddenly not following the usual script?

"You wanted me to promote my products to make Annie jealous, right?" I continued. "I've done exactly as you asked... The promotion is going extremely well, and my merchandise sales are about to exceed the total sales of Annie's ridiculous picture book."

I deliberately paused, waiting for Philip's praise or at least some expression of satisfaction. After all, this man was always so easily pleased by my "progress."

"Everyone online is talking about how generous you are to me.Annie will definitely see it and be jealous."

"I suppose so," Philip responded with surprising flatness. Usually, he would eagerly ask for details or chuckle with self-satisfaction.

I furrowed my brow. "You seem a bit off.Did something happen?"

"I've been seeing a therapist lately..." Philip's voice dropped lower."I suddenly realized that since being with Annie, every step I've taken, right up until now, has been wrong."

What? I felt a chill run through me. This spineless idiot actually went to a therapist? And now he's having regrets?

"Am I stupid, Sarah?" His voice choked with emotion. "To only realize the problem now?" I resisted the urge to mock him. Yes. youi've always been stupid. Philip Baker. Stupid to think Annie was perfect, and stupid to think I actually cared about you. But right now. I needed to stay calm and not let him see through me.

"Why are you suddenly saying this?" I asked cautiously.

"When a person makes a mnistake, the first thing they should do is address the problem, then apologize and find ways to make amends. But what am I doing? Trying to make her jealous through you? That will only push her further away."

I heard him sniffling. and I inwardly sneered. This pathetic man, breaking down after a little therapy. His weakness disgusted me, but perhaps I could use this to my advantage.

"You regret it?" I asked. deliberately adding a hint of sadness to my voice.


"No, I just suddenly realized how many mistakes I've made..."

"So you're planning to make it up to her now?" I bit my lower lip, my heart racing. If Philip truly wanted to return to Annie, my "ATM" would be shutting down.

"Yes. I need to treat her better," Philip replied. "Don't worry about the money I've already given you-I won't take it back. You can use it however you like."

I secretly breathed a sigh of relief. At least the money already in my hands was safe.

"But... I might not provide any additional funds in the future."

Damn it! I cursed inwardly. Before reconciling with Robert or winning
over Howard. Philip was my only reliable source of income.

I immediately played my tramp card. "What about the baby?"My voice became sorrowful and fragile. "Are you abandoning that responsibility too?"
"I'll take care of it." Philip immediately responded. "T'll provide living expenses and child support for both of you.'

I silently rejoiced. Thank God for this stupid man's sense of responsibility!This so-called "his child"-this lie had become my most powerful weapon.

"That's great, otherwise the baby and I wouldn't know how to survive," I said, feigning weakness. The moment I hung up, I let a cold smile of victory spread across my face.

I lay back on the bed.gently stroking my belly as I contemplated the current situation:

- Robert was avoiding me, clearly still angry


-Howard repeatedly rejected my advances

- Philip wanted to keep his dístance, though he would still provide money,he was no longer at my beck and call

I clenched my jaw. No, I would not lose control. I decided to first secure the financial pipeline from Philip.

I picked up my phone and texted Philip:′′Ifyou're going back to Annie,then... I should be free to find a new boyfriend,right?"

I knew this would provoke him. Philip hadalways believed I loved only him. Once I mentioned other men, especially after claiming to be pregnant with his child, he would surely panic. "You know my expenses are considerable," I continued typing. "If I can't find someone to support me, the living allowance you provide might not be enough."

"Let me think about it." Philip's reply came unexpectedly quickly.

I smiled smugly. It seemed my fish was already taking the bait. Men in high society-their pride and possessiveness were so easily exploited.

I thought he would need at least an evening to consider, but Philip's call came almost immediately. Seeing his name flashing on the screen, a wave of triumphant pleasure washed over me. The frustration from my failed interaction with Howard vanished completely.
"What is it?" I asked, pretending to be confused. "Why are you calling me at this hour?"

"Sarah." Philip's voice was filled with conflict, "I've been seriously thinking about what you just said."

"Yes?" I responded casually, though inwardly I was mocking his predictability. Men, always so easy to manipulate.

"My answer is that I absolutely cannot allow my child to call another man father."

"Oh?" I deliberately dragged out the syllable, my eyes gleaming with calculation.

"I also don't want you to be with other men."

I silently cheered. Though he had already said he no longer loved me,a man's possessiveness was always so intense. I had completely captured his weakness. "How am I supposed to survive if I stay single according to your wishes?"I pressed further.
"I will support you financially." Philip solemnly promised.

"Aren't you worried Annie might object?" I asked, feigning concern while deliberately planting seeds of doubt in his mánd.

The silence on the other end told me my strategy was working. "We'll discuss the details after I reconcile with her," Philip finally said, his tone filled with uncertainty.

"No problem." I complied submissively, unable to hold back laughter after hanging up.

Philip.you fool! He never treated Annie well, while Howard practically worshipped her like a goddess. The chances of Annie returning to Philip were virtually zero, yet this arrogant man still harbored fantasies!

The phone rang again-it was Philip: "So we've agreed-you absolutely cannot see other men."

"You can rest completely assured," I promised sweetly, my tone like soothing a restless child. "As long as you're willing to support me,I'm happy to maintain this arrangement."

After hanging up, I smiled with satisfaction. Philip would never know that even as he gave me money, I would continue pursuing Howard while also seeking opportunities to reconcile with Robert.

In the worst-case scenario, if I lost all three men, I still had my social media career-though I wasn't sure how long that would last without Philip's financial backing. But those were problems for the future. For now,at least I had secured Philip's economic support. I always gave myself multiple escape routes before taking action. That's why, no matter how the situation changed.I would always be the one who came out on top.
###Chapter 180:Who Hit Your Face?

Brian's POV

I pushed open the front door, keeping my head down as I hurried into the living room. The burning sensation from Dad's slap still lingered on my cheek, though I'd already cried all my tears out in the car.That confrontation with Dad at the kindergarten had been terrible-I couldn't help telling him the truth, telling him this was all his fault, that he was the one who introduced me to Sarah, who made me distance myself from Mom. And then he did something he'd never done before-he slapped me.

"How can you just abandon your mother?" I remembered him asking,right before that loud, stinging slap landed on my face.
I rubbed mny cheek, hoping the swelling would go down a bit. Mitchell had remained silent throughout the drive, only occasionally glancing at me through the rearview mirror. He knew what had happened, but he didn't say anything. which I found somewhat comforting.

When I got home, I was hoping to slip straight to my room, but Grandma Ruth was already waiting in the living room. The moment she saw me, the gentle smile on her face instantly froze.

"Brian, what's wrong? Are you feeling down?" Grandma immediately put down her magazine and walked toward me.

"No," I hurriedly lowered my head, "I'm just a little tired from studying. I want to go rest."

But Grandma had already reached me and gently lifted my chin. When she saw the redness and swelling on my face, her eyes narrowed dangerously. "Who hit your face?" Grandma's voice suddenly became frightening.nothing like her usual gentle tome.
Before I could answer. Mitchell had already walked in. Seeing the scene before him. he angrily said, "You should look in the mirror and see your face properly. It's swollen almost as big as an apple!"
"I'm fine. Grandma," I tried to make my voice sound casual, "it's just a small scrape, don't worry."
"Mitchell, what exactly happened?" Grandma completely ignored my words and asked Mitchell directly.
"Philip Baker did it." Mitchell answered without hesitation. "You tell me,this Wall Street elite Philip, is there something wrong with his brain? He's already abandoned Brian, yet he still hits him. What right does he have!"
Grandma's face instantly turned ashen with anger. "Exactly! I'mn going to demand an explanation from him right now!"

Hearing this. I panicked and quickly grabbed Grandma's sleeve. "But Grandma, we haven't had dinner yet. If you go now, you'll be hungry.Besides, he was probably just angry for a moment. Mom used to say we shouldn't act impulsively when things happen, but calm down first and then handle the situation."

After saying this,I suddenly realized I had started thinking like Mom.Without even noticing, I had begun to imitate her way of handling problems-calm, rational, not swayed by emotions. This realization made me feel both proud and a little sad, because I didn't know if Mom would be pleased with my growth at this moment.

Mitchell also joined in persuading her: "Brian's right, it's better to eat something first..."

Grandma finally calmed down. She gently stroked my swollen face.her eyes full of concern. "It must hurt terribly. That Philip hit you like he wanted to kill you. You're his son, not his enemy. How could he do this?"
Fighting through the pain. I tried to sound casual as I replied, "Probably because he was stupid enough to lose Annie, and then he didn't want his child either... Now he's all alone in that mansion with no one to talk to,and slowly his brain just went bad?"

"That must be it." Grandma nodded, though I could tell her anger hadn't completely subsided.

I attempted to smile, but the pain in my face made me wince and suck in a sharp breath. Grandma brought an ice pack and carefully placed it on my face. The cold sensation provided some relief from the pain.

That night. I slept restlessly, my dreams filled with Dad's angry face and Mom-Annie's retreating back as she walked away. Even in my dreams,I couldn't reach her no matter howw fast I ran. I missed her so much it hurt worse than my swollen cheek. If only I could go back in time and undo all my mistakes, tell Sarah to leave us alone, and just be Mom's little boy again. But I'd chosen wrong, and now I had to live with it.

When morning came, my face still throbbed, but the swelling had gone down a little. I splashed cold water on my face, careful to avoid the tender spot, and stared at my reflection. The boy looking back at me seemed older somehow, like yesterday's slap had forced me to grow up faster than I should have.

The smell of pancakes drifted upstairs-Grandma's special recipe. At least some things stayed the same, even when everything else was falling apart. Downstairs. I sat at the dining table eating my ccreal.occasionally stealing glances at Grandma. Her movements as she prepared more breakfast looked the sameas usual, but I knew she was still angry about yesterday.I needed to find a way to distract her.

"Grandma," I put down my spoon and said quietly, "our Upper East Side Private Preschool has a performance today. I hope you can come with me Mitchell and Ms. Taylor will be there too."

Grandma turned around, looking somewhat puzzled. "Is it okay to have so many people?"

"Of course it is!" I answered immediately, hoping to convince her."The other kids in my class all have their moms and dads there.I'm the only one who doesn't. But I think, with Mlitchell and Ms. Taylor, I would feel at least a little better. And with you there as my actual family, I won't be too different from the other kids."

As I said these words, I felt a pang of sadness. My classmates had been asking questions now,which I found ashamed to answer.

"Of course, don't worry. I'll definitely be there," Grandma's voice interrupted my thoughts,her eyes full of sympathy.

I immediately jumped down from my chair ad ran excitedly to my room.
I took out the Brooks Brothers suit I had prepared and handed it to Grandma. "This is what I decided to wear! I look really nice in it. DDon't forget to bring it this afternoon, okay?"

"No problem," Grandma smiled, gently stroking my hair.

After breakfast, I put on my backpack and prepared to leave, but I noticed Grandma was following behind me. "Why are you coming too?" I asked curiously.

Grandma affectionately ruffled my hair. "To drop you off at school,and then I need to buy a few things."

"That's great!" I happily took Grandmai's hand. With her by my side. I felt like the luckiest kid in the world.

In thecar, I chattered excitedly to Grandma about everything happening at kindergarten-our performance, my small role, the new things I'd learned recently. Grandma smiled as she listened, occasionally nodding or asking me questions. But Inoticed that her eyes would sometimes become very serious, as if she were contemplating something important.

When we reached the kindergarten in the Upper East Side, I waved goodbye to Grandma. "See you this afternoon, Grandma! Don't forget my suit!"


Grandma nodded with a smile. "Don't worry, I won't forget."

I was about to turn and walk through the gates when I inadvertently saw Grandma saying something to Mitchell. Her expression suddenly became serious. Mitchell nodded, his face also showing anger. I thought I heard the words "Philip" and "explanation."

Suddenly,I understood-Grandma was going to confront Dad.

I hesitated. wondering if I should run back and stop her, but the school gates had already closed.
###Chapter 181: Who Would Even Care About You?
Philip's POV

I stared at the investment report on my desk, unable to absorb a single word.Yesterday, I had slapped Brian-my own son. The memory had haunted me all night, robbing me of sleep. Never in my life had I imagined I would raise a hand against my child, yet here I was, living with that reality.

The internal phone on my desk rang, interrupting my troubled thoughts.

"Mr. Baker, there's a lady in the lobby who wants to see you," came the receptionist's voice.

I frowned, irritation flaring. "Didn't I say no visitors without appointments?
1


"She says she's your former mother-in-law, Brian's grandmother."

Ruth Miller? My heart sank. She must be here about yesterday's incident.

"Send her up," I said, straightening my tie and taking a deep breath to compose myself.

A few minutes laer, a knock sounded at my door.

"Come in."

Ruth pushed the door open and stepped inside. Her face was grim, lips pressed into a thin line. Those eyes-so similar to Annie's-fixed on me with unmistakable fury. "Philip Baker. I should have come to see you last night" she said without preamble,her voice cutting through the air like a blade.
"What can I help you with?" I feigned ignorance, though my fingers betrayed me, tapping nervously against the desktop.

Ruth's eyes narrowed. "Why did you hit Brian? We had an agreement when you relinquished custody-you wouldn't provide financial support.but you also wouldn't interfere in his life."

I tried to defend myself: "I am still legally his father." Even to my own ears, the words sounded hollow and pathetic.
"If he does something wrong, I will correct him. It's not your place to discipline him anymore. Do you understand?" Ruth took a step forward.her presence filling my spacious office despite her small stature.

I knew I was in the wrong, but still couldn't help saying, "I'm concerned you might be too lenient with him."

"Ha!" Ruth let out a cold laugh. "His biological father abandoned his mother for another woman, then abandoned him too. That child has experienced more trauma at five years old than most people do in decades.If I show him extra love and care, it's the least he deserves! And even if you were concerned about me spoiling him, does that justify hittinga child?"


Each of Ruth's words stabbed at me like tiny daggers.

She looked directly into my eyes. "Tell me, what terrible thing did he do that warranted you striking him? If he truly did something wrong,I would stand with you unconditionally."

I remained silent. This was entirely my fault, and I knew it He said he didn't want to contact his mother.," I finally admitted the truth.The moment the words left my mouth. I realized how absurd my justification was.

Ruth's expression transformed from surprise to mockery. "That's your excuse forhitting him?"

"He's only five. How could he be so cold..." I argued weakly,knowing I had no moral high ground. The truth was, I hadn't slapped Brian because he wouldn't contact Annie-I'd done it because his behavior reflected my own-a man running from his responsibilities.

Ruth shook her head in disbelief. "But isn't his attitude entirely your doing?"

"How is this my fault?" I instinctively countered.

"Think about it," Ruth's voice was calm yet razor-sharp. "First, you had an affair. Then, you deliberately encouraged him to distance himself from his mother. After divorcing Annie, you washed your hands of him completely.When he finally realized his mistake and wanted to make amends with his mother, Annie had already given up on him. He sensed that his mother doesn't want to see him anymore... so he's respecting her space. Isn't that actually mature of him? Would you prefer he pester and harass her instead?"

Her assessment left me speechless.

"As for you..." Ruth looked me up and down critically,"You insisted on divorcing my daughter, and fine, she granted you that. Now you want to pursue her again?"

Ruth suddenly frowned. "Don't tell me you're planning to use Brian to get back into Annie's life?"

"All men make mistakes. Can't she forgive me just once?" My voice was barely audible, and I hated myself for using such a pathetic excuse."We do have a child together, after all..."

Ruth's gaze instantly turned glacial. "When you were betraying her,did you ever consider you might end up here? Or did you simply assume that no matter how badly you hurt her, she would always forgive you unconditionally?"

She was right. I had always believed Annie would forgive me because she had once loved me so deeply. But I was wrong. When she left, there was no hatred in her eyes-only indifference, as if I were already dead to her.I should have understood then, but I was too arrogant.

"You're ridiculous," Ruth continued. "I know my daughter better than anyone. She might seem gentle and soft, but she's more stubborn than a mule. Once she makes up her mind, nothing can change it. Even if you dragged Brian along to beg her to come back, she wouldn't spare you a second glance. You need to let this go."

Her eyes sharpened like a hawk's. "But I must warn you... if you ever use her name as an excuse to hit him again, you'll see just how ruthless I can be!"

I looked up at her, wanting to appear firm, but found I couldn't.

Suddenly,Ruth stepped forward and delivered a resounding slap across my face. My cheek instantly burned with pain.

"You hit Brian, so I'm hitting you back on his behalf. Now we're even,"Ruth said, her voice suddenly calm. I took a deep breath,struggling to maintain my composure. "I've been patient with you only because you're Annle's mother. Don't push your luck.


"Hmph!" Ruth glared at me coldly. "She has nothing to do with you anymore, which means I have nothing to do with you either. You don't need to show restraint on anyone's account."

She turned and walked away, her back straight and determined. After the door closed, the office fell into complete silence, leaving me alone with my thoughts.

My mind drifted to the past. There was a time when Ruth had adored me.Whenever Annie and I visited her in Brooklyn, she would prepare all my favorite dishes. Annie would even joke, "Mom, you treat Philip better than you treat me. I'm getting jealous!"

We were a family then-warm and harmonious. Now.everything had changed.

Annie was gone. Ruth despised me, Brian feared me. My office was spacious, but with only me inside, it felt painfully empty. I touched my still-burning cheek, feeling a terrible hollowness inside.

I once had everything, yet I had destroyed it all with my own hands.Even though I still commanded respect on Wall Street and had accumulated considerable wealth,what did it matter now?

Who would even careabout me anymore?
###Chapter 182: Just the Two of Us

Annie's POV

I awoke in Howard's embrace, morning light filtering through the half-drawn curtains into the spacious bedroom. The memory of last night's passion on the balcony lingered vividly in my mind, and I felt my cheeks flush thinking about our intimate moments under the stars.

Howard's long arm was wrapped around me, his chest pressed firmly against my back, warm and solid. I shifted slightly, attempting to get up.but his response was to hold me even tighter.

"Trying to escape so early?" Howard's voice was deep and magnetic.instantly evoking memories of what had happened in the bathroom last night.

After returning from the balcony, we'd been covered in sweat and decided to shower together. Hot water cascaded over our bodies,steam filling the entire bathroom. Howard had pinned me against the cool wa11.the stark temperature contrast making me shiver involuntarily. His arm muscles had tensed as he effortlessly lifted me, leaving me no choice but to cling tightly to his broad shoulders.

Water had streamed down his sculpted back muscles, my fingertips sensing the power contained beneath his skin. He'd held me firmly against the wall, entering me with passionate determination,each movement revealing his irresistible strength tempered with tenderness. Through the steam,his gray eyes had locked onto mine, his gaze leaving me nowhere to hide-not that I wanted to escape.

"What are you thinking about?" Present-day Howard noticed my distraction and rolled over, pinning me beneath him. His eyes still held that same intensity from the night before.

"Last night," I admitted honestly, my fingers tracing the line of his jaw."The part in the shower."


Howard's eyes immediately darkened, and he leaned down, his lips brushing my ear. "We could re-enact that.".

Just then, we heard Lucy's voice from outside the door: "Mom! Dad! Are you awake?"

Howard instantly rolled back to lie beside me, and we exchanged knowing smiles. Such was life-passion and responsibility coexisting side by side.

"We're up, Lucy," I called back. "Give us a few minutes."

Lucy responded from the hallway: "Okay! Don't forget I have my performance this afternoon!"

I heard her little footsteps fade away and turned to Howard. "She checked that white dress at least five times before bed last night. I'm sure she's already been looking at it again this morning."

"She's taking this performance very seriously," Howard nodded, his smile revealing a touch of pride. "I hope she doesn't get too nervous."

We quickly washed up and made our way to the dining room where,just as I'd predicted. Lucy was waiting for us with her carefully selected white pearl-decorated dress laid out beside her.

"Mom,what do you think of this dress?" Lucy asked, her blue eyes wide with anticipation."Will I be the prettiest little host?"

"Of course you will" I smiled,gently stroking her soft golden curls."You'll be the most radiant one there."

After breakfast, we dropped Lucy off ait the Upper East Side Private Preschool. She immediately ran toward Penny. and the two little girls were instantly absorbed in discussions about the performance, so much so that they forgot to say goodbye to us.

Back in the car. Howard turned to me. "Let's head straight to the office.We can pick her up at noon."

"Sounds good." I nodded. "I have some finishing touches to do on my illustrations."

In my office at Howard Technologies, I focused on the picture book illustrations I was working on. This work gave me a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction completely different from the emptiness I'd felt when I was with Philip.

Before long. Howard rose from his desk and walked over to stand behind me. He leaned down, his hands resting on my desk, effectively encirclng me in his embrace. "How's it coming along?"

His breath brushed against my ear, causing me to shiver involuntarily.I could feel the warmth of his chest through my blouse, that familiar heat bringing my thoughts back to the previous night.

"Almost done," I struggled to keep my voice steady. "Give me another half hour."


Howard's lips grazed the side of my neck. "I love watching you work so intently."

His hands began to wander, lightly caressing my chest. I tried to concentrate on my drawing, but Howard's touch made that nearly impossible.

"Howard," I protested softly, "we're in the office."

"My office," he corrected with amusement in his voice, "and the door is already locked."

Only then did I notice that at some point, he had returned and locked the office door.Howard gently turned my chair to face him.

He pulled me to my feet, then sat down in my place, his hands resting on my waist. Howard unbuttoned his shirt, revealing his muscular chest and abs, which looked particularly enticing in the soft light of the office.

"We have a full hour before we need to pick up Lucy," he murmured, his gaze traveling downward before returning to my face, his eyes holding an unmistakable suggestion. "Plenty of time."

I felt his fingers lightly caressing my waist, understanding exactly what he wanted. A thought formed in my mind-I wanted to see this powerful man lose control because of me. The desire surprised me, but also excited me tremendously.

I slowly knelt before Howard, seeing a flash of surprise and anticipation in his eyes. My fingers gently unbuckled his bel, then moved to the button and zipper of his pants. His breathing became more rapid, his fingers unconsciously threading through my hair.

"You don't have to..." he began, his voice already husky.

"I want to." I replied softly, looking up to meet his gaze. Seeing the fire of desire burning in his eyes, I felt an unprecedented sense of control.

I caressed his already hardened desire through his underwear,satisfied to see Howard's Adam's apple bob up and down. When I pulled down his underwear, releasing his firmness, I couldn't help but marvel again at his size.


I lowered my head to touch the tip with my lips, and Howard immediately let out a deep sigh. My tongue circled the head,tasting him. His hand tightened in my hair, but remained gentle enough.
"Annie..." he called my name in a low voice filled with desire and longing.

I gradually deepened the intimate contact, taking more of him into my mouth. Howard's body visibly tensed, the strong muscles of his thighs tightening under my palms. I could feel the contours of each muscle,reminding me that although I had the initiative at this moment,he could easily change the situation at any time.

I wrapped one hand around the part I couldn't take in, moving up and down in rhythm with my mouth. Howard's breathing became even more rapid. and the pressure of his fingers in my hair increased, guiding my pace.

"God, Annie..." he growled, his voice raspy and sexy.


I looked up at him and found him staring at me. his eyes filled with naked desire and amazement. From this angle, I could clearly see his abdominal muscles flexing with each breath, the perfect definition of his chest. He was so strong and powerful, yet now losing control because of my actions.

I quickened my pace, and Howard's reactions grew more intense. Suddenly,his hand tightened, stopping my movements.

"Enough," his voice was hoarse, "or this will end too quickly."
He pulled me up and sat me on his lap,his hands simultaneously slipping under my skirt, skillfully removing my last defense. His fingers explored my secret garden,discovering it was already wet.
"So wet for me," he whispered in my ear, "just from pleasing me?"

"Yes," I confessed, my voice trembling with desire, "seeing your reactions excites me."

Howard's gaze grew even more intense. He suddenly stood up, lifting me and placing me on the desk. His movement demonstrated his amazing strength,making me feel momentarily dizzy.

He stood between my legs, leaning down to kiss my lips while unbuttoning my blouse and unhooking my bra. When my upper body was bare, his lips immediately moved downward, taking my peak into his mouth. I had to bite my lower lip to prevent myself from making too much noise.

Soon,we became one, both letting out a satisfied sigh.

Our union was intense and quick, and before long. I felt myself reaching the pinnacle. Howard followed shortly after, burying his face in the crook of my neck with a deep groan.

We maintained this position for a moment, enjoying the tranquility after intimacy. Howard gently kissed my cheeks and lips, his movements tender and cherishing.

"You always surprise me, Annie," he said softly, his eyes shining with tenderness, "in every way."

We smiled at each other with perfect understanding, then began to straighten our clothes. Howard brousht a tosel from thetehl 
in his office to help me clean up.

I checked the time and realized it wasn't even noon yet. "It's still early.Lucy's performance doesn't start until the afternoon."


Howard pulled me close, once again capturing my lips with his. "So we still have plenty of time for just the two of us."
###Chapter 183: You'll Get What's Coming to You
Catherine's POV

I deliberately arrived at the office a full houir early,positioning myself strategically outside Caroline Gluck's office door. When I spotted her leisurely strolling down the hallway, a wave of anger surged through me.I maintained my composure, arms crossed, as I watched her approach.


Caroline slowed her pace when she noticed me, her brow furrowing slightly. "Can I help you with something?" she asked, her voice carrying unmistakable confusion as she reached for her office door.


"Absolutely," I replied, making no effort to mask my irritation. "Was it you who told Bill White which project team I'm on?"


Caroline's expression shifted from confusion to indifference as she pushed open her door. She shrugged, gesturing for me to enter before following me inside. "Yes. it was me. So what?" Her casual admission only fueled my anger.


I stepped into her office but remained standing while she settled behind her desk. "Who do you think you are?" I demanded, my voice rising despite my attempt to maintain control. "Did you get my permission?What gives you the right to share information about me? What makes you think you have that privilege?"

"Whether I have the right or not is irrelevant." Caroline responded coldly.arranging some papers on her desk without bothering to look up at me."What matters is that I knew the information,he asked me about it, and of course I told him." She finally glanced up. her eyes devoid of any remorse. "You're Annie's friend, and I don't like Annie, which means I don't like you either. He's obviously going to hound you constantly now that he knows you have money." A smug smile played at the corners of her mouth. "I'd be delighted to see you miserable. Even if he hadn't asked, I would have told him anyway."

I let out a cold laugh, studying her face. "So that's how it is?"

Initially. I'd thought this was a simple misunderstanding that could be resolved with a straightforward conversation. But the situation had revealed itself to be something else entirely. She had deliberately sabotaged me. and worse, she was targeting me because of my connection to Annie.If that was the game she wanted to play, I wouldn't hesitate to respond in kind.

"Then don't blame me for what happens next," I said through gritted teeth before turning toward the door.

"What are you planning to do?" Caroline called after me, her voice betraying a hint of unease beneath her confident facade.

I paused at the doorway, turning just enough to look her in the eye. "Do I need to tell you? Just know that after you've messed with me, I won't let you have an easy time either. That should be enough information."

In that moment. I could almost taste the satisfaction as I watched her smug expression falter. A rush of adrenaline surged through me-the kind you get when you finally decide to strike back after being pushed too far.My mother always said I had the patience of a saint until crossed,and then the tenacity of a bull. Caroline hadI just unleashed the bull, and she had no idea what was coming. I walked out without waiting for her response, heading directly to the elevator. As the doors opened. I nearly collided with Susan Moore,who was about to step out. Our eyes met, and she gave me a subtle nod of acknowledgment. Some unspoken uniderstanding passed between us as I entered the elevator and pressed the button for the top floor.
Standing on the rooftop terrace of Howard Technologies. I took a deep breath of the crisp Manhattan air. The project had just concluded successfully, and the company had awarded generous bonuses to our team.I should have been in high spirits. My colleagues, seeing our success,had eagerly signed up for new projects, leaving no immediate work for me even if I wanted it.

Perhaps this timing was fortuitous, giving me the space to deal with the Caroline situation properly.

"So what happened with Caroline? How did it go?" Susan's voice interrupted my thoughts as she quietly approached, her eyes darting cautiously toward the roof access door to ensure no one was eavesdropping.

"I was fine until you brought it up. Now I'm furious all over again,"I replied irritably.


"What happened?" Susan pressed,moving closer.

"She's completely shameless!" I exclaimed, my frustration bubbling to the surface. "First of all, I've never done anything to wrong her. Second,she went behind my back to Bill, deliberately causing problems for me! And she's not even slightly remorseful-she openly admitted it was her and seemed proud of it! It's infuriating!"

Susan studied my face. "So what are you going to do? Let it go and swallow your pride.or...?"

"Do I seem like the type of person who just lets things slide?" I raised my chin defiantly. "Obviously not. Don't worry. I already have a plan."
Susan's eyes lit up with curiosity. "What kind of plan? Tell me!"

I shook my head. "Let me ask you something first. If you knew what I was planning, and Caroline questioned you about it, would you tell her or not? If you told her, you'd be betraying me. If you didn't. Caroline would probably accuse you of workplace bullying!"

Susan looked surprised. "You've really thought this through, haven't you?"

"Of course." I patted her shoulder reassuringly. "So not telling you is the best option for both of us."

Susan seemed disappointed but nodded in understanding. "Fair enough."She checked her watch, mentioning she had work to get back to, and headed back toward the door.

The March wind in New York still carried a biting chill. After a few more minutes of contemplation, I felt the cold seeping through my blazer and decided to move to the stairwell. I pulled out my phone and called Bill.

"Aren't you the one who's been so eager to talk to me?" I said when he answered.


"You're willing to meet with me?" Bill's voice couldn't hide his surprise.

"Absolutely. Let's meet at the coffee shop downstairs today at noon."I replied decisively.

Bill immediately became cautious. "I don't have any money." Since his father had cut him off, he'd been surviving on handouts from friends.

"Don't worry. T'll treat you," I assured him. My salary wasn't particularly high, but spending a little money to make Caroline pay seemed worth the investment.

"I can order whatever I want?" Bill's voice instantly took on a greedy tone.


I quickly established boundaries: "Everything combined can't exceed a hundred dollars. Order whatever you want within that limit. Anything over that. you'll have to cover yourself." Setting clear parameters seemed prudent to prevent him from taking advantage.

"You have a job and just got a bonus. Why are you being so stingy?" Bill complained.

"My salary isn't that high, and the fact that I'm willing to treat you at all is generous enough. If you think I'mn being cheap... we can just forget about it." A hundred dolars was my absolute limit-living in New York was expensive enough without funding Bill's extravagance.

"No, no, it's fine. See you at noon," Bill quickly relented. After all, he was currently scrounging for meals wherever he could,so any free lunch was better than nothing.

"Good." I ended the call and turned my gaze toward Caroline's office.

"Just you wait, Caroline," I muttered under my breath. "You'll get what's coming to you!"
###Chapter 184: Really Loves Me That Much?

Catherine's POV

"Just you wait. Caroline," I muttered under my breath,staring determinedly at the direction of Caroline's office. "You'll get what's coming to you!"

I took a deep breath to calm the anger bubbling inside me. WhileI wasn't typically the type to get worked up easily, being targeted by Caroline for no valid reason was enough to make my blood boil. Especially when she had the audacity to disclose my personal information to someone like Bill White. The thought alone made my skin crawl.

After wrapping up the remaining work for the day, I glanced at my watch and headed down to the coffee shop. Bill White was already there waiting for me. and the moment he spotted me,he started complaining.

"You've become so busy these days, making me wait this long," he said with a mocking tone that immediately set my teeth on edge.

Anger flashed through me, and I rolled my eyes at him. "All companies typically have lunch breaks at the same time. You chose to arrive extraordinarily early, so what was I supposed to do about that?"

"Alright," Bill nodded quickly, clearly caught off guard by my direct response.

I promptly reminded him of our arrangement. "Remember, you can order whatever you want as long as the total stays under a hundred dollars."

"Don't be so stingy," Bill immediately protested.

"I'm sorry, but I'm just a working professional now. I earn a fixed amount
each month,so I need to be careful with every dollar. If you can't accept these terms, I'm happy to leave right now." I replied firmly.
God, he was insufferable. Ever since his father had cut him off financially.he'd been scrounging meals from anyone who would offer,yet still maintained that entitled attitude of a spoiled heir.

Bill quickly backed down. "I'm perfectly happy wwith those terms!"

He proceeded to order a coffee and a pasta dish, totaling ninety-nine dollars. then proudly declared, "See how economical I'm being? Not only am I staying within your limit, but I'm even saving you a dollar."

"How considerate of you," I replied dryly,thinking that ninety-nine dollars for a coffee and pasta was ridiculous-but then again, Bill's extravagant habits were deeply ingrained.

Once we were seated, Bill began reminiscing about his glory days. "I do miss the old days, you know. Back then, when I met friends, we'd casually order packages worth tens of thousands of dollars. Other friends who treated me to meals were also very generous, not like now, where everything has to stay under a hundred dollars, and some people are even reluctant about that."

My patience was wearing thin. "First of all, you've never treated me to anything. Secondly, if you're so close with those friends, why aren't you asking them for free meals? They treat you to such exquisite food...why come to me for cheap coffee and pasta?"

My sharp response clearly stung his pride.

Bill suddenly looked both angry and confused. "I've been wondering the same thing! When I was treating them, I never complained. If they wanted to eat. I was happy to pay. But now that I've fallen on hard times and it's their turn to treat me they all avoid me like the plague... why is that?"
"It's simple. Your father kicked you out. Everyone loaned you money before, but this time your father was particularly angry and publicly announced that he wouldn't repay any of your debts. If they help you now.they'll suffer along with you."
I felt a twinge of pity suddenly rise within me. Bill was a pitiful figure.never having learned how to take responsibility for his actions.
"They'd suffer with me?" Bill asked, a glimmer of understanding flashing in his eyes.

I nodded. "Exactly."

Bill fell silent, and I continued, "While most fair-weather friends are unreliable, you can be sure that some people genuinely care about you."

"Are you calling mne out specifically to hint that you're someone who truly cares about me?" Bill suddenly said.

I nearly choked on my drink! This guy's self-awareness was truly incredible. A sudden thought crossed my mind-this could be the perfect turning point I needed.

"Can you only see me?" I put on a mysterious expression.

"Is there someone else?" Bill asked, perplexed.


I found myself enjoying this game. "You're so oblivious! Have you forgotten about Caroline Gluck? Hasn't she contacted you since your downfall?" "I guess not!" Bill answered, but clearly wasn't connecting the dots.

Suppressing my excitement. I calmly said. "That's precisely what shows her feelings for you are special."
"If she likes me, why didn't she contact me in the first place?" Bill was even more confused.

I inwardly chuckled while outwardly appearing to analyze a profound psychological issue. "Think about it. Before your father abandoned you.what was your identity? The eldest son of the White Group! The heir who might one day take over the family business! Most importantly... you already had a girlfriend then!"

Mentioning his girlfriend reminded me of his presumptuous attitude when he once tried to pursue me, which still irritated me to this day. He had actually referred to me as a "girlfriend substitute," as if I should have been honored by the title!

"And she was just an ordinary girl, so naturally she felt inferior and didn't dare approach you. Back then, you were the young master surrounded by admirers. Now it's different-your father has publicly severed ties with you.In everyone's eyes, you're just an ordinary person now," I lowered my voice as if sharíng a secret, "that's why she finally has the courage to appear before you. Isn't that enough proof of her feelings?"

I watched Bill's expression transform from confusion to revelation,feeling a sense of accomplishment rise within me.

"You're saying she loves me?" Bill asked, his face suddenly brightening.

"Exactly! Think about it-why would she randomly tell you about my raise?" I clapped my hands in feigned excitement, while internally thinking
about how smoothly this plan was unfolding.

"Why?" Bill still wasn't entitely convinced.

I fought the urge to roll my eyes. "Obviously because she knows your current situation! No one can help you, so you can only turn to me for help. And with my meager salary, I naturally wouldn't want to spend money on you. But she's different... when it comes to spending money on you,she would be extremely generous."

I saw hope glimmering in Bill's eyes and almost felt guilty for my words.Almost.

"That makes sense." BiIl's eyes lit up, but then he frowned again, "but Caroline hasn't actually spent any money on me."

"That's definitely because you haven't asked," I said definitively,crossing my arms. "Otherwise, she would absolutely spend money on you."

I anticipated Bill asking Caroline for a small amount of money, then watching her awkwardly deal with the situation. It would be a subtle revenge, enough to let her experience what it felt like to be used.

"Don't believe me? Ask her now," I gestured for Bill to make the call,my heart racing with anticipation.

Though skeptical, Bill dialed Caroline's number: "I don't have money for food. Could you transfer some to me?"


"How much do you need?" Caroline's voice came through the speakerphone,surprisingly calm.

Bill didn't know how much to ask for and looked at me questioningly. I held up five fingers, thinking that fifty dollars would be enough to inconvenience Caroline.
"Five hundred?" Bill silently mouthed to me.

I shook my head frantically, clenching my fist and whispering."Fifty!"

"Five thousand!" Bill blurted out.

I was so shocked I nearly jumped out of my chair, wanting to stop him,but it was too late. My heart sank immediately; this was far beyond what I had expected.

"No problem. I'll transer it to you," Caroline replied smoothly, as if Bill had only asked for five dollars.

My jaw practically hit the table. This... this couldn't be happening! Five thousand dollars! How could Caroline agree so easily?

"Check if you've received it," Caroline asked, her tone even carrying a hint of pleasure.

Bill opened his banking app to see that $5,000O had been deposited,his expression like he'd won the lottery. I felt dizzy, as things had completely deviated from my expectations.

"If you need living expenses next month, you can ask me again. My salary is quite decent now, so supporting you isn't an issue," Caroline continued,her generosity making me shiver.

Bill looked to me for help, clearly not having anticipated such a smooth transaction either. My heart was racing, my mind filled with questions.Caroline had so casually given away five thousand dollars?"Thank you." Bill finally managed to respond, obviously shlocked by this unexpected windfall.
After hanging up, he turned to me, his eyes shining: "Caroline really loves me that much?"
###Chapter 185: Now She Would Live with the Consequences
Catherine's POV

I sat frozen in the coffee shop at the bottom of Howard Technologies,staring directly at Bill White across the table, my mind still reeling from what had just transpired. Five thousand dollars. Caroline Gluck had transferred that amount to Bill without a moment's hesitation,completely derailing my modest revenge plan.
"Caroline really loves me that much?" Bill asked again, his eyes gleaming with disbelief and excitement as his fingers continuously scrolled over the $5,000 transaction displayed on his phone screen.

I forced myseIf to remain composed, though my thoughts were still churning. For an average person, this wasn't a trivial sum. Yet Caroline had given itaway so effortlessly?

"It certainly seems that way," I nodded thoughtfully. "In fact, you could tell me more about other things she's done for you. Sometimes,you can see a person's true feelings in the small details."

Bill looked somewhat puzzled but began recounting various interactions between himself and Caroline. With each story, I would nod or gasp appropriately.

"That's right! Someone who doesn't love you would never be willing to do all these things!" I exclaimed with feigned enthusiasm.

As our conversation continued, I noticed BilI's expression gradually shifting from confusion to firm conviction. He was genuinely beginning to believe that Caroline harbored special feelings for him. I couldn't help 
feeling a touch of satisfaction-despite the unexpected turn of events,my plan seemed to be working.
Even if Caroline might actually have some slight feelings for Bill. I knew the White family maintained exceedingly high standards for potential daughters-in-law. A girl like Caroline, without a distinguished background or connections, would undoubtedly face all sorts of unfair treatment if she married into the White family. When that happened, it would be as if the White family were exacting revenge on my behalf!
"By the way," I leaned slightly forward, lowering my voice, "now that you've discovered Caroline's feelings, it's best not to be too obvious about it."

"Why not?" Bill furrowed his brow, looking utterly confused.

Seeing his genuine bewilderment, I couldn't help but sigh internally. This man knew absolutely nothing about the complexities of interpersonal relationships. Remembering my ultimate goal of getting back at Caroline, I adjusted my expression into a sympathetic smile.

"It's actually quite simple. She has a crush on you, which means in her heart, she's placed herself in a lower position while elevating you," I explained patiently. "Right now, she only dares to approach you bit by bit.If you suddenly show that you're very interested in her... what do you think would happen?"

Bill pondered for a moment before asking hesitantly,"She'd be scared?"

"Exactly!" I clapped my hands in approval. "Then she'd avoid you. And you don't want to lose a woman who truly loves you, right?"

Bill nodded, though his expression indicated he hadn't fully grasped the concept."Right." "So just continue interacting with her normally, as you did before."I suggested,secretly satisfied with my control of the situation.
"Should I buy her a gift?" Bill suddenly asked.

I took a sip of my drink, responding nonchalantly, "You could."

Bill immediately picked up his phone and began browsing online merchandise. I could tell he was searching for something impressive-not too cheap,something that would appropriately express his feelings,but not so expensive that he couldn't afford it.
A few minutes later. Bill turned his phone toward me. "What do you think about this $4.999 gift?"
His words shocked me so much that I involuntarily spat out my drink. "Pfft!"

"What are you doing?" Bill quickly pulled back hs hand,grabbing some napkins to wipe his phone screen, clearly annoyed.
I finally understood why Bill wasn't popular with women. "She transferred you $5,000, and you're planning to spend $4,999 on a gift for her,leaving yourself just $1?" I asked incredulously.

"Yes," Bill answered without hesitation, as if this were the most reasonable thing in the world.

I stared at him in disbelief for a few seconds, then tried a different approach. "If you spend all the money, won't you just have to ask her for more?"

Bill paused, then had a moment of realization: "That's true!" "Although Caroline said she would support you. you need to consider her income too." I gave Bill a meaningful look. "If you keep asking for money back and forth, you'll take $10,000 from her. After paying rent and living expenses, she might not have anything left. Could you bear to see her living in poverty because of you?"
Bill genuinely seemed conflicted, apparently never having considered things from this perspective. "Hmm..."
"Keep enough for your living expenses, and use the rest to buy he a gift."I suggested.
The coffee shop had gradually emptied, and the post-lunch quiet made our conversation more intimate. Bill began calculating his daily expenses out loud: "I can eat cheaper for breakfast... lunch should be filling... I'll skip dinner..."

Listening to Bill's budget plan, I felt immensely grateful that I had never been romantically involved with him. Seeing how he expected women to support him financially while he made no effort to work would make any girlfriend despair.

Though I disliked Caroline, my conscience couldn't let her jump into such a financial drain. "So when you've spent all your money this month, what about next month? Will you continue asking Caroline for more?"

Bill seemed genuinely stumped by this question, his expression growing confused and uneasy.

"Don't you plan to find a job to support yourself?" I pressed further."Since your father has cut off your financial resources,you need to think abouIt your future. You can't rely on others forever, or expect women to support you. After all. you have perfectly capable hands and feet." Bill fell silent. possibly considering these questions seriously for the first time in his life, Seeing him like this. I suddenly felt an unexpected pang of sympathy, but it was quickly diluted by my anger toward Caroline.
I glanced at my watch and stood up, gathering my things. "I need to get back to work. Think about it. okay?"
"Mm." Bill nodded absent-mindedly, still lost in his thoughts.

As I left the coffee shop, I couldn't help feeling both satisfied and unexpectedly concerned. My revenge plan against Caroline had taken an unforeseen turn, but perhaps this was even better than what I had initially imagined. Watching Bill potentially drain Caroline's finances while she developed genuine feelings for him would be a kind of poetic justice I hadn't anticipated.
Regardless, Caroline had messed with the wrong person. Since she had chosen to use my personal information to hurt me, she deserved to experience what it felt like to be used herself.

Walking back toward the Howard Technologies building, I noticed that the sky had clouded over, the Manhattan skyline losing its earlier brilliance.A fitting backdrop for my thoughts, I mused. I had always prided myself on being direct and honest in my dealings with others. This little scheme was out of character for me, but Caroline's deliberate actions had pushed me beyond my usual boundaries.

As I reached the building entrance, I caught sight of my reflection in the glass doors. For a brief moment, I barely recognized myself-the calculating expression, the cold satisfaction in my eyes. I paused,wondering if I was becoming someone I wouldn't like. But then I remembered Caroline's smug face as she admitted to sharing my information with Bill, and my resolve hardened again. Caroline had made her choice. Now she would live with the consequences.
###Chapter 186: A Painful Ending for a Beautifu Beginning
Annie's POV

When we arrived at the preschool enatrance, the dismissal scene was already bustling with activity. Parents gathered in small groups near the gate while children raced toward them like flocks of cheerful birds. My eyes scanned the crowd, searching for Lucy's familiar silhouette.

Soon enough, I spotted that golden head. Lucy was already waiting by the entrance,waving excitedly when she saw us approach. "Mom! Dad! I'm over here!" Her blue eyes sparkled with excitement,her small face slightly flushed with anticipation.

I walked over to Lucy and crouched down to meet her at eye level.She immediately grabbed my hand and said eagerly. "Mom. Penny's mother hasn't arrived yet. I want to stay here with her." Her gaze held such genuine concern for her friend, and this natural display of kindness sent a warm current through my heart.

"Of course, sweetheart," I smiled, gently adjusting a few strands of hair on her forehead. "We'll wait until Penny's mom arrives."

Howard nodded in agreement behind me, his hand resting lightly on my.shoulder. Lucy smiled with satisfaction and ran backto Penny's side.I watched as the two children talked animatedly, sharing secrets that only they understood.

"They get along so well," Howard whispered near my ear.

We waited quietly to the side, Howard's hand remaining gently placed at the small of my back. His casual intimacy made me feel incredibly secure. Not long after. Sue Peterson arrived in a hurry, her face clearly apologetic as she immediately addressed her daughter: "I'm so sorry, sweetie. I'm a little late."

Penny shook her head understandingly. "It's okay, Mom. Lucy stayed with me," Her tone was surprisingly mature, impressing me with the thoughtfulness these young children sometimes displayed.
"Thank you for waiting for me," Sue gave Howard and me a grateful look before bending down to hug Penny. "Youa didn't wait too long, did you?"
"We actually just arrived ourselves," I responded warmly, then suggested,"Should we have lunch together, or would you prefer separate arrangements?"

This simple question prompted a series of glances: Sue looked at Penny.Penny looked at Lucy, and Lucy was surprised to find everyone waiting for her answer.

Lucy furrowed her brow in confusion. "Such a big decision for a little person like me?" Her small face displayed an adult-like perplexity that I couldnI't help but find endearing.

I gently ruffled Lucy's golden hair and replied,"Yes,sometimes adults need to hear what children think too."

Lucy thought seriously for a moment before answering. "Then let's eat together?" As she spoke, her gaze fell on Penny, and she added with a slightly pleading tone, "I want to spend more time with you."

Penny's face immediately lit up with a bright smile. "That's exactly...”

"What I was thinking too," she chimed in, and the two little girls high-fived with perfect synchronicity.
Seeing that the children had decided, Howard suggested, "I know a nice restaurant nearby that's perfect for kids."

So we chose that restaurant, known for being child-friendly-decorated with bright colors and cartoon characters, complete with a dedicated children's play area.


After ordering, Lucy and Penny pressed themselves against the display counter, staring in amazement at rabbit-shaped puddings. Their four big blue eyes widened with wonder, creating such an adorable scene that I couldn't resist taking a few photos with my phone.

"There are such cute puddings? How do they make them?" Lucy asked incredulously, her small finger pointing at the glass case.

Penny seemed equally shocked: "Yeah, I don't know either. But these chefs are so amazing."


Sue and I sat in seats next to the children, exchanging smiles,enjoying this rare moment of peace and warmth. Howard had gone to the restroom,leaving just us two mothers with the children at the table.


Sue poured me a glass of water and remarked thoughtfully,′′Inever imagined that life with children could be so fulfilling, especially after going through so many changes." Her voicecarried a hint of reflection, as though she was contemplating her own life journey.

"I know what you mean," I agreed wholeheartedly. "Before meeting Lucy.I even thought... that communicating with children meant constant arguments,making everyone miserable." My thoughts drifted involuntarily back to those difficult days with Brian, when no matter how hard I tried to do what was best for him, he never listened, always believing I was deliberately opposing him. That feeling of helplessness still tightened my
chest when I thought about it.

Sue seemed to notice my change in mood and asked curiously, "Your previous child, was he difficult?"

"Something like that. But rather than hating him, I disliked his father more. Because in my view... he was influenced by his father to gradually become that way." I sighed softly, unconsciously rotating mny water glass as I recalled those painful days.

Sue looked at me thoughtfully: "Then I'm guessing your ex-husband cheated? These men are all the same."

"Exactly. He thought the world should revolve around him." Thinking about Philip's arrogant attitude of entitlement, my voice inevitably carried a trace of bitterness.

Sue shook her head indignantly: "When a man betrays his marriage,he completely changes. It's like al the scumbags in the world are cut from the same mold-my ex-husband Dave was like that too. At first, it was all sweet talk about what he'd do for me, but as soon as we got married,his true colors showed." Anger flashed in her eyes. "Then all they think about is pleasing that third party, even turning their children into tools to impress her."


"That's so true!" I agreed emotionally. "Brian was led by his father to spend time with that woman Sarah. He constantly told our child she was better than me."

Sue reached out to pat my shoulder,her eyes full of understanding and sympathy: "New York is full of jerks like that. They think having a little money means they can hurt people however they want. After Dave left,he still tried to leech off me, shamelessly using Penny as an excuse. It's disgusting."Her voice carried the anger of someone who had been betrayed.a feeling I knew all too well.
L laughed softly: "After some things happened. I completely gave up on both father and son. Sometimes, the best choice is to let go and start over."As I said this. I was surprised to find my tone remarkably calm; those wounds that once kept me awake at night now seemed distant when I spoke of them.

"Absolutely," Sue nodded firmly,her eyes shining with the resilience that comes from shared pain. "Only when you move forward do you realize how much better the world and the people out there can be. Those jerks don't deserve our tears."
I looked toward Lucy, who was laughing and paying, and felt a warmth rising in my chest: "Otherwise, I wouldn't have met such a sweet,lovely daughter, and I wouldn't have met Howard-he made me believe again that there are still good men in this world worth trusting."

Just then, the server brought our food. I raised my voice: "Lucy, Penny,time to eat!"

"Yay!" The two little girls responded cheerfully, hopping over to the table like two lively bunnies.

Howard had returned and was already seated at the table. Sue and I took the children to the restroom to wash their hands. After that rare conversation between women, I felt a special connection with Sue--as mothers who had both experienced marital betrayal, our pain and growth shared remarkable similarities.

When we returned to the table, Lucy's cheeks were flushed with excitement as she told me, "Mom, the play area over there is so much fun! I want to go back after I finish eating!" Her blue eyes sparkled with anticipation,the kind of pure joy that made me want to grant her every wish.
"Me too!" Penny immediately agreed, and the two girls high-fived again,as if they had already planned their entire afternoon activities.
"Oh?" Seeing the children had reached a consensus,I raised an eyebrow and smiled, "But don't you have your performance this afternoon? After lunch. don't you want to get your hair done nicely?" I gently twirled a lock of Lucy's golden curls with my finger. "When will you have time to sort out your hairstyle?"

The two little girls looked at each other, their expressions changing from excitement to confusion, then to distress. Lucy bit her lower lip,caught in an innocent dilemma, her eyes moving back and forth between the play area and me.

"Could we... get our hair done first, then play for a little while?" Lucy suggested tentatively.

I nodded in agreement: "That's a good idea, sweetheart. After we eat,I'll help you both with your hair, then you can play for a bit, but remember to leave enough time to get back and prepare for the performance,okay?"

"Okay!" The two little girls answered in unison,smiles returning to their faces.

Watching them thinking so seriously, a warmth spread through my heart.These small moments of hesitation showed they were beginning to understand the importance of appearance and the responsibility of preparing for important occasions-a sign of growth that was far mnore mature than Brian's recklessness and selfishness. Perhaps, as Sue had said, sometimes you need to experience a painful ending before you can welcome a beautiful beginning.
###Chapter 187: Then I Wouldn't Have Gotten t o This Point with Her
Howard's POV


I sat in my chair at this child-friendly Manhattan restaurant,observing the scene unfolding before me.


Lucy sat at the table, carefully examining the rabbit-shaped pudding. She turned it around, her face lighting up with delight. "It looks almost exactly like the ones in the display case!"

Penny had already removed the small box around her pudding and gently tapped it with her spoon. The rabbit-shaped dessert jiggled in a way that was undeniably adorable.


"Look!" Penny excitedly showed Lucy her discovery.

Lucy's mouth fell open in amazement."Wow..."

"What's wrong?" Penny asked with concern.

Lucy's voice carried a hint of regret.′′Idon't want to eat it now."

Penny looked at Lucy, then at her own pudding,her expression equally conflicted."Me neither!"


Annie gently stroked Lucy's golden hair and suggested softly, "Why don't you eat your hamburger and fries first?"

"Okay!" Both girls immediately began eating their main courses,though their eyes never strayed far from the tempting puddings.

Watching this scene. I couldn't help but smile. Children's innocence is always so touching. For Lucy, a simple pudding could bring such joy-the kind of small happiness I had almost forgotten during my years in the business world.


I observed Annie taking a bite of her hamburger, a brief expression of distaste crossing her face. She glanced at the two children eating happily and her lips curved upward slightly. I understood what she was thinking-adults and children certainly have different tastes. But she didn't verbalize it, simply continuing to eat quietly. These small considerations for the children's sake always drew me to her.

After finishing their main courses, Lucy's attention returned to the pudding. She whispered, "I'll just taste it..." and carefully took a small spoonful.

"It's delicious!" she exclaimed, her eyes narrowing with satisfaction.

Seeing this, Penny also gathered the courage to take a bite, then looked at Lucy in surprise,"It really is good!

The girls quiekly finished their puddings. The pure contentment on their faces gave me a wonderful sense of warmth. Before.I only concerned myself with company metries and business expansion,but now,these small family moments brought me unexpected fulfillment.

After the meal. Annie took out a small comb from her bag and said to Lucy,"Come here,let me do your hair."

Lucy immediately nestled into Annie's arms, then turned her back to her.Annie first brushed Lucy's golden hair until it was smooth,then began creating an intricate little princess hairstyle. Watching Annie's practiced movements.I remembered how nervous and uncertain she had been when she first started caring for Lucy. Now, she was so skilled, as if she had ays been Lucy's mother.
When Lucy walked to the mirror and saw her transformed reflection, her face lit up with satisfaction. Next. Penny approached Annie. "Me too."
Annie carefully assessed Penny's face shape, then created a more elegant style for her. When Penny saw herself in the mirror,looking so different from usual, she was almost speechless.
In that moment, I suddenly realized that Annie possessed a natural maternal radiance. She not only took excellent care of Lucy but also made other children feel comfortable and loved. This was precisely one of the qualities I admired most about her.

"Should we take a picture?" Annie suggested,taking out her phone.

"Yes!" both girls answered in unison, then ran to Annie and posed.

Watching this heartwarming scene, I took out my own phone and captured several photos. This was the first time I felt compelled toshare my personal life on social media. I've always valued my privacy, rarely posting personal content on Instagram. But at that moment, I wanted everyone to see the happiness in my life.

I posted the photo on Instagram with a simple caption: "A happy day."

The post immediately attracted significant attention. After all, I rarely shared personal content on social media. The comments section quickly became active.

"Is this Howard Thompson's first family photo? I can't believe my eyes!"someone commented in surprise.

"Is the little girl in the photo Mr. Thompson's daughter? She's adorable!" another comment asked.
I replied briefly: "Yes, she is."

"Is that beautiful lady your wife? You all look so happy." a business associate inquired.
I glanced at Annie, who was focused on carefully styling Penny's hair,her expression attentive and genle. I replied: "She will be."
The comments section immediately became more animated:

"Wow. Howard Thompson sharing personal photos! This is rare content."


"You look as harmonious as a painting. So nice to see this side of your life.



"Lucy and that lady are both beautiful. You're one of the cutest families I've seen."

"Who would have thought our CEO had such a strong family side? Nice work-life balance!"

There was even a comment from a company employee: "No wonder the CEO has been in such a good mood lately. Our team has benefited greatly!"

Just as I was enjoying this rare leisurely moment, my phone vibrated.Philip Baker had left a comment on Instagram: "Did you get Annie's permission before posting her photo?"

I raised an eyebrow. The comment was both boring and ridiculous.The man who had abandoned Annie and Brian now questioning my respect for her? The corner of my mouth turned up slightly, not from humor but from contempt for such hypocrisy. I looked up at Annie, not far away,interacting with Luey, her eyes reflecting gentle affection. From the sadness when she first came to my home to the conlidence and vitality now shining in her eyes,this transformation gave me genuine satisfaction.
I tapped on my keyboard, responding unhurriedly: "How do you know I didn't have her consent?"

Philip continued pressing: "Is she willing to make your relationship public?



Such meaningless harassment. I calmly replied: "We've been public about our relationship for some time. Didn't you know?" Then I set my phone down. no longer engaging with his worthless questions.
Since my company's expansion, I rarely had such personal time. These precious moments weren't worth wasting on Philip Baker.

Less than three minutes later, my phone rang. Philip's name on the display made me frown slightly, but considering it might involve Annie, I stepped aside to answer.

"It's me," I said,my voice calm and low.

"Howard, do you realize how negatively this could affect Annie?" Philip's tone was filled with false concern.

I listened expressionlessly, sensing the absurdity. Philip was attempting to project his own irresponsibility onto everyone else.

"Elaborate," I replied briefly, my voice remaining steady.

"If you don't marry Annie, then she..." "I will marry her." I calmly interrupted his hypothesis, without revealing any unnecessary emotion.
There was silence on the other end for a moment, as if my direct answer had disrupted his train of thought. Then he began a new round of speculation: "Are you certain Annie is right for you? What if after marriage you suddenly discover you're incompatible? What then? Will you abandon her? Divorce her?"

My gaze fell on Annie and the children in the corner of the restaurant, the answer in my heart crystal clear.
"If we weren't compatible, then I wouldn't have gotten to this point with her," my voice was steady and resolute. "Philip Baker, I'm deliberate in my decisions."

The other end of the line fell silent again. I didn't need to explain further.In business decisions, I never act rashly; in matters of the heart, even more SO.

Annie and Lucy had become indispensable parts of my life. This was something Philip, who had so easily abandoned his family, might never understand.
###Chapter 188: Is It Too Late?

Philip's POV

After Ruth left my office, I remained alone in the silence, the burning sensation on my cheek a stark reminder of everything that had just transpired.


"You had everything and you destroyed it." Ruth's words echoed relentlessly in my mind.


I leaned back in my chair, barely able to breathe. She was right. Once,I had a beautiful family-Annie's love and Brian's adoration. Now, Annie felt nothing for me. Brian was afraid to see me, and I was left alone,trapped in this spacious yet empty office.

The most painful realization was that I had finally understood all of this was my own doing.

I picked up my phone, mindlessly scrolling through social media.Suddenly,a photo caught my attention-Howard's Instagram post. In it,Annie was styling two little girls' hair, her smile so natural and radiant,in stark contrast to the exhaustion and pain that had marked her face during the final months of our marriage.

"A happy day." Howard's simple caption felt like a dagger straight to my heart.


That should have been my photo. That shoud have been our happiness.Looking at that relaxed smile on Annie's face-one she had never shown me-an indescribable jealousy and sense of loss washed over me. She was genuinely happier than she had ever been with me-this knowledge burned like poison in my soul. I stared at the photo, myfingers trembling, driven by an inexplicable anger and need for control. I clicked on the comment section and hastily typed."Did you get Annie's permission before posting her photo?"

The moment I hit send, rationality returned.and I instantly regretted it.The comment was both boring and ridiculous,completely revealing my jealousy and insecurity. Pathetically, I couldn't even control my own fingers,just as I couldn't control my life.

Howard's response was clean and direct: "How do you know I didn't have her permission?"


I continued to press: "Is she willing to make your relationship public?"

"We've been public about our relationship for some time. Didn't you know?11


I stared at this answer, my finger hovering over the screen. Howard was right.Why would I assume they would be secretive?

Taking a deep breath, I dialed Howard's number. Each ring tightened my heart a little more. When he answered, my throat felt dry.

"It's me," his voice was calm and low, in stark contrast to the chaos inside me.


"Howard, do you realize how negatively this could affect Annie?" I asked,feigning concern and trying to sound somewhat authoritative. I knew I had no right to appear as a protector, but I needed an excuse to talk to him.


Maybe I could catch Annie's voice.

"Elaborate," he replied briefly, his voice remaining steady. 
"If you don't marry Annie, then she-" I began crafting a narrative.attempting to appear concerned for Annie's welfare.

"I will marry her," he calmly interrupted my hypothesis, without revealing any unnecessary emotion.

Three simple words, direct and clear, yet they hit my chest like a heavyweight punch. I had fantasized that he might justbe playing around.had comforted myself with the thought that Annie would eventually realize Howard wasn't serious. That fantasy shattered in an instant.

I was momentarily speechless, my lips dry, quickly adjusting my strategy."Are you certain Annie is right for you? What if after marriage you suddenly discover you're incompatible? What then? Will you abandon her?Divorce her?" As I spoke these words, I knew I was projecting-exactly what I had done.


"If we weren't compatible, then I wouldn't have gotten to this point with her," his voice was steady and resolute. "Philip Baker, I'm deliberate in my decisions."


The certainty in his tone stung me. In that moment, I suddenly realized I had never had such certainty. Every relationship I'd been in, even my marriage to Annie, had always been accompanied by doubts and escape routes.


"Relationships change, people change," I insisted, the anxiety in my voice evident even to myself.

"I know what I want, and I know who Annie is-not who I want her to be,but who she truly is."

That statement was like a mirror, reflecting that I had never truly known Annie. I only saw what I wanted her to be docile, compliant.always forgiving of my mistakes. I wanted to object. but he continued:
"Have you considered that perhaps your inability to commit is a personal deficiency,not the norm?"

Those wordIs hit my stomach like a punch, nearly suffocating me. Howard had articulated the truth I had been avoiding all along-the problem was never Annie, but me. "What do you mean?" I struggled to keep my voice steady.but could feel it trembling slightly.
"You treat relationships like disposable commodities. Not everyone does that, nor should they."

Each word pierced my heart like a needle. I felt a shame I had never experienced before, because he was absolutely right. I had indeed treated relationships, Annie, my marriage, as accessories that could be replaced at any time.

"That's not fair!" I protested, but even I found the defense weak. My voice had lost its initial arrogance, replaced by futile justifications.

"Not fair?" Howard questioned, his voice carrying an edge for the first time.
"You had Annie's love and Brian's admiration, yet you destroyed everything with your own hands. Now you're questioning my commitment to her?"

I couldn't answer. He had pinpointed my hypocrisy with surgical precision.My throat felt blocked, unable to produce any sound, as I silently held the phone,feeling the burning pain with each passing second.

"I've made arrangements," he continued calmly, seemingly sensing my struggle, the edge in his voice disappearing again. "If anything happens to me,Annie will be well taken care of."

This statement caught me off guard, piquing my curiosity. "What do you mean?" I asked eagerly, trying to understand how Howard differed from me.


"My assets. Apart from what's reserved for my parents,everything else will go to Annie."


My heart skipped a beat. This answer shocked me. Throughout my marriage with Annie, I had never considered her long-term interests; even during our divorce. I deliberately ensured she got nothing.

"You're not leaving anything to Lucy?" I asked in surprise, almost instinctively looking for flaws in his plan.

"Lucy is too young to manage such wealth, and it would make her a target.By ensuring Annie's financial security. Lucy will naturally be taken care of.Annie loves Lucy as her own, they will support each other."

Howard's answer plunged me into deep thought. Every decision he made was thoroughly considered, taking into account all possible outcomes. And me? What arrangements had I ever made to protect Annie or Brian? I wasn't even sure what they would receive if I suddenly passed away.

This level of comprehensive consideration left me speechless. I had never thought of anyone the way Howard did, not even those I claimed to have loved. This realization sent a chill through my bones.

"Who knows if you're sincere or just saying pretty words?" I weakly challenged as a last resort, the conviction already gone from my voice. It was a final struggle, a pathetic attempt to not admit I had thoroughly lost.

Howard chuckled lightly. "You don't need to believe my words;observing my actions should be enough."

This simple answer completely defeated me. I mumbled a few words as farewell, then hastily hung up, not wanting him to hear the wavering in my voice.

*This is what it truly means to love someone.*

Howard didn't just say he loved Annie-he proved it through his actions.In comparison, what had I given? I had driven Annie out of our home during the divorce, ensuring she got nothing. I had instigated Brian to distance himself from her. Even now, my desire to reconcile stemmed more from wounded pride than genuine love or remorse.


I suddenly realized that even if Annie and Howard were to separate someday-which seemed almost impossible-she would never return to me. After experiencing the depth of true love, how could she ever accept my shallow affection?


A tear fell onto the desk, making a faint sound.

*That's the sound of my heart breaking.*

No one had ever taught me how to truly love someone.Myparents marriage had been a cold arrangement of interests, my father's affairs were an open secret, and my mother's response had always been detached tolerance.


*If I learn how to love now-if I truly change myself-would it be too late?



I thought of Annie's smile, of the family I once had and destroyed with my own hands, of Brian who carried the shadow of my failures. *We still have a child together." I clung to this thought as a last hope.But even as this idea formed. I knew it wasn't enough. A child is not a bargaining chip for forced reconciliation:using Brian in this way would only cause more harm.
###Chapter 189:Bravo!

Annie's POV

"Are you sure you want to sit in the front row with us?" I asked,looking at Sue and Penny, the latter clutching Lucy's hand tightly. After lunch,when the four of us arrived at the auditorium, we discovered several empty seats in the front row.

"Of course!" Sue replied with a warm smile. "After all, our daughters are the stars of today's show, aren't they?"

I nodded in agreement, noticing how adorable Lucy and Penny looked with their carefully styled hair. After lunch. I had helped them each with different princess hairstyles, and both little girls had been absolutely delighted with the results. Following a brief play session in the playground area, we had arrived just in time for makeup and final rehearsals before heading to the auditorium.

"Lucy, Penny, you should go backstage to get ready," Howard gently reminded them, his voice warm and encouraging. "The performance will begin soon."

The two little girls nodded excitedly, exchanged smiles, and then ran hand-in-hand toward the backstage entrance. I watched their retreating figures-Lucy's golden curls shimmering under the lights,Penny following closely behind her. A wave of warm satisfaction washed over me. This was genuine progress-just six months ago when I first met Lucy, she barely spoke to anyone. Now she not only had a close friend but was confidently participating in school activities.

We found our seats in the front row, with Howard sitting to my right and Sue to my left. "This is my first time sitting so close to the front," Sue whispered, her voice tinged with a hint of nervousness,"What about you?"

"Mine too," I smiled in response. Sue took out her camera and began adjusting it, muttering about angles and lighting.
"Aren't you nervous at all?" she asked, seemingly surprised by my calm demeanor.
I pulled my camera from my bag, slightly puzzled by her question. "Nervous about what?"
"I plan to record Penny's performance and I've been worrying about how to capture it perfectly," Sue explained. "What about you? For Lucy's sake,you must want to get the best footage possible,right?"

I nodded, carefully adjusting my camera settings. "Absolutely, it's a special day."

The lights gradually dimmed, music began playing,and the audience fell silent. The curtains on stage slowly parted to reveal Lucy standing center stage, already changed into the white pearl-decorated dress she had checked repeatedly that morning. She stood confidently under the spotlight,holding a small microphone, her voice clear and bright as she began:"Respected teachers, dear parents, welcome to the Upper East Side Private Preschool's Spring Performance..."

Watching Lucy on stage, my thoughts involuntarily drifted back to our first meeting-when she had hidden behind Howard, sneaking glances at me, too shy to uatter a single word. Later, when I moved into Howard's home,she would only speak to me while remaining silent around others.

And now, here she was,standing center stage, confidently hosting the entire event, her voice strong, her expressions animated. I felt a gentle yet profound pride-not just happiness for Lucy's progress, but gratitude for being part of her growth journey.

"She's doing so well." This thought crystallized clearly in my mind.Though I wasn't her biological mother, in this moment. I genuinely felt that special emotional connection. Not based on blood ties, but built on daily companionship and care, on the precious trust we had gradually established.

I raised my camera and began recording. Before long, my arms started to ache. As I adjusted my position, Howard noticed my discomfort.
"Your arms will get tired holding the camera like that," he said softly. "Let me take over."

No further words were needed; our eye contact was sufficient. Howard gently took the camera from me, his fingertips lightly brushing against the back of my hand, imparting a subtle warmth.

This silent attentiveness filled me with gratitude-Howard had noticed my need and offered help without my having to ask. These small acts of consideration, ordinary yet genuine, outlined the picture of a healthy relationship.

This moment naturally led me to contrast it with my experiences with Philip. I remembered when Brian was small, and I had carried him for so long that my arms ached unbearably.

"Philip," I recalled mny exhausted voice, "could you hold Brian for a while?My arms are really sore."

He hadn't even looked up at me, responding coldly: "How hard can it be to carry a child? Other parents carry their kids around all day without
complaining. You're always making a big deal out of nothing."

Hearing those words. I had felt a wave of disappointment and hurt, but had no choice but to continue carrying Brian home. After arriving.I placed him on the sofa and massaged my numb arms, wondering if perhaps I really was being too sensitive.

Howard's whisper interrupted my memories: "What are you thinking about?"

I shook my head lightly, returning to the present. "Nothing, just... thank you."

On stage, Lucy announced the first performance, then gracefully exited. A group of children began their dance routine, and the audience soon erupted in enthusiastic applause.

After several performances, Lucy returned to the stage,this time announcing Penny's solo. I felt Sue straighten in her seat beside me,nervously raising her camera. Penny wwalked onto the stage, and as Lucy passed her, she gave Penny's hand a gentle squeeze of encouragement.The gesture was so natural, yet revealed the deep friendship between the two children.

After Penny's performance ended, Lucy returned to center stage to continue hosting. I found myself smiling unconsciously, proud of her presentation. She introduced each performance with increasing confidence.her voice becoming more clear and strong. When she mispronounced a name, I instinctively held my breath-but Lucy simply smiled graciously,offered a brief apology, and continued smoothly. Her composed handling of the small errorfilled me with admiration.

This scene reminded me of a recitation competition when Brian was five. He had forgotten a line. and I remember being so tense I could barely stand,knowing how disappointed Philip would be. Sure enough. on the way home, he had criticized mercilessly: "You couldn't remember those few simple lines? That's so disappointing. How have you been teaching him?" Brian had sat silently in the back seat, head bowed, while I remained speechless, filledwith a sense of failure.

Now,watching Lucy on stage,I felt a liberating lightness.

The days with Philip had been a nightmare. I hated his harshness toward Brian. Hated his perpetally dissatisfied expression.
Unlike Brian's experience, Lucy's growth environment was different. Here.there was no harsh judgment, only genuine support and encouragement.This atmosphere allowed children to develop naturally and let me simply appreciate her performance without worrying aboutfacing criticism afterward.

Howard recorded the video attentively, occasionally exchanging knowing glances with me. We didn't need many words between us; simple eye contact was enough to express our feelings.

When the final performance ended, Lucy returned to center stage for closing remarks. Her voice was slightly tired but filled with joy: "Thank you all for coming and for your support. Our spring performance is nowe concluded. Please give a round of applause for all our performers!"

The entire audience rose in enthusiastic applause. I stood up, clapping vigorously and shouting "Bravo!" I saw Lucy scanning the audience from the stage, and when her gaze fell upon Howard and me, she broke into a radiant smile.

Just then. I felt someone gently tap my shoulder. Turning around,I saw my mother. Ruth, who had somehow made it to the auditorium.

"Annie," her voice carried a trace of barely perceptible pride."could you send me a copy of the video you recorded later?"
###Chapter 190: I'm Glad to See You Happy,Annie
Annie's POV

"Annie," her voice carried a trace of pride I had rarely heard before,"could you send me a copy of the video you recorded later?"


"Mom? What are you doing here?" I couldn't hide my surprise. The last time we met was when I brought Howard to her place in Brooklyn,and the conversation hadn't ended pleasantly. She had always believed my divorce was a mistake, insisting that "abandoning" Brian was irresponsible.

"I came with Brian," her answer made my heart tighten.

Brian. The little boy who was once my entire world, the child I loved unconditionally, had now become a deep wound. Thinking about what he had done to me-helping Sarah cause my miscarriage,making me lose that unborn child-a familiar pain washed over me again.

I didn't know how to respond, standing there in silence. My mother seemed to sense my discomfort and gently took my hand.


"Don't worry, Annie," she patted my hand reassuringly. "I've accepted your divorce from Philip."


"What?" I looked at her in astonishment. This was completely different from her previous attitude.

"Rather than foreing you to reconcile with Philip, making you continue living with that terrible man, suffering every day..." she paused. "this is better for you now." "You really think so?" I still couldn't belleve my ears.

"Yes," she nodded firmly. "Even if the future is uncertain, at least you're happy now."


"Most importantly, who can guarantee that if you hadn't divorced Philip,your life would definitely be better when you're older?"

Hearing these words from my traditionally conservative mother was almost unbelievable. This was drastically different from her coldness and questioning when she last met Howard.

"As for Brian..." she continued, her voice lowering slightly.

"What about him?" I asked, my heartbeat involuntarily quickening.

"He hurt you, though you never told me exactly what happened."

"Mom,I..."


"No,you don't need to explain," she interrupted. "I know you. Annie.For you to completely give up on him like this, what he did must have been extremely serious. So I won't try to convince you to go back to that environment anymore."


"Mom..." I felt my throat tighten, at a loss for words. Suddenly, I stepped forward like I used to as a child and hugged her tightly.

Her body stiffened momentarily before relaxing, her familiar embrace surrounding me. That comforting scent-a faint lilac perfume mixed with her unique warmth-made me feel as if I had returned to my childhood.This feeling of beingprotected by my mother had become so rare for me as an adult that I unconsciously closed my eyes, deeply inhaling this moment of peace. 
"You weren't happy before. I could see it but couldn't help," my mother's voice sounded near my ear, slightly bitter, while her palm gently stroked my back. "That's made me feel guilty for a long time."
I shook my head in her embrace. "It wasn't your fault. I didn't tell you everything because I didn't want you to worry."
"I understand," she nodded gently, her fingers softly combing through my hair, a small gesture she had done since I was little. As we slowly separated, I could see tears glistening in her eyes.
"You mentioned wanting the performance video?" I changed the subject.


"Yes,could you send it to me?"

"I'll send it tonight when I get home."


My mother nodded with a smile. "That would be wonderful." Her gaze moved past me toward the stage. "By the way,is that beautiful little girl the daughter you're caring for now?"

"Yes, that's Lucy Thompson," my voice softened involuntarily.

"She looks lovely."

"She lost her parents in a yacht accident when she was very young."I explained. "Her uncle Howard became her guardian."

I turned to look at Howard, who was carefully adjusting the camera.

My mother's gaze followed Howard's figure, thoughtfully saying."The way he looks at Lucy is special, full of love and protection."

I looked in the direction of her gaze and felt a warmth rising in my chest."He truly loves her. You should see him preparing breakfast for Lucy every morning. No matter how busy the company is, he never misses thnat time with her." A smile formed on my lips. "Sometimes when he works late,he sneaks into Lucy's room to check if she's sleeping well. That kind of attentiveness and care comes from the heart."

My mother's expression softened significantly as she nodded gently. "That kind of love can't be faked."

"And he doesn't just love Lucy as she is now," I continued, my eyes sparkling. "Howard is really thinking about her future. He told Lucy that Howard Technologies will always have a place for her, if she wants it someday."

My mother raised her eyebrows, clearly surprised. "He sounds like a truly responsible person."

"He is," I nodded, my voice becoming even softer. "Seeing him like this made me realize that loving a child isn't just about verbal promises,but about practical actions and long-term planning."

My mother's gaze lingered on my face as she sighed softly."Very different from Philip, isn't it?" Her tone no longer held reproach, only understanding.

I shook my head slightly, remembering Philip's attitude toward Brian."Philip never had any real plans for Brian. He just went with the flow.satisfying him with material things while neglecting emotional guidance."

After a brief silence, my mother's gaze returned to the stage,asking curiously, "Tell me more about Lucy. She seems like a very special little girl."

A smile involuntarily spread across my face. "She really is special! When I first met her, she barely spoke to anyone."

"Was it trauma from losing her parents?" my mother asked,always perceptive about children's emotional states.

"Yes, selective mutism." I nodded. "Initially she only spoke to Howard.then gradually began to trust me. Being able to watch her open up step by step, from barely speaking to now hosting an entire event on stage-the transformation is truly remarkable."


"So you helped her emerge from the shadows?" There was a hint of admiration in my mother's voice.


"It was mutual," I answered softly, feeling moisture gathering at the corners of my eyes. "During my lowest point, Lucy's trust gave me the strength to stand up again. During those days, Philip and Sarah made me believe I was worthless, but Lucy showed me I could still be a good mother,that I deserved to be loved and needed."

My mother reached out and gently held my hand. "I'm glad you found a life that truly suits you."


"Thank you, Mom," I squeezed her hand back, feeling along-absent warmth and understanding.

Thinking about all the moments with Lucy, I couldn't help but smile.

"Howard is also very good to me. We're very happy now," I added.


My mother's gaze softened. "Knowing you're doing well puts my mind at ease,"


"Mom," I took a deep breath, my tone surprisingly calm, "T've grown up.I can take responsibility for my own choices." "I know."

"You don't need to worry about me anymore. Let me live the life I want."

She was silent for a moment, then nodded. "You're right, my daughter."

On stage. Lucy was finishing her hosting duties. Her cheeks were flushed with excitement, and when her gaze met mine again, she unconsciously smiled and waved at me. I returned the gesture,feeling a surge of warmth in my heart.

I noticed my mother observing our interaction, her eyes revealing a hint of contentment. Perhaps she finally understood that my happiness didn't necessarily have to be built on a traditional family model.

As the event ended, my mother stood up, preparing to leave.

"Are you leaving now?" I asked.

"Yes, I need to pick up Brian," she replied.

After a moment's hesitation, I hugged my mother again. This embrace was more composed than before, but equally emotional. Her familiar scent reminded me of our home in Boston, of those simple, warm days of my childhood. In this brief moment, I felt a long-forgotten sense of security,as if there had never been any disagreements between us, as if time had never passed.

"Thank you for coming, Mom," I said softly, my voice almost buried in her shoulder.

My mother tightened her arms, then gently patted my back. "I'm glad to see you happy,Annie."
###Chapter 191: Now It's My Turn to Take Control
Sarah's POV

I hunched over my desk, straining to draw illustrations on my computer.
when a wave of dizziness hit me from standing in the same position for too long.


My pregnant belly made my back and waist ache unbearably, making me feel like an awkward, heavy sphere with limited mobility. I shifted irritably,trying to find a comfortable position, but ultimately gave up and threw my stylus onto the desk with a sharp "thwack."

"Damn it!" I cursed under my breath, massaging my sore lower back.Pregnancy was truly torturous-not only was my body constantly uncomfortable. but my emotions had become hypersensitive and prone to outbursts. I frequently exploded over minor issues, then berated myself for losing control.

Leaning back in my chair, I couldn't help wondering: why was I working so hard? With my looks and charm. I could easily find a wealthy man to depend on and live a comfortable life if I wanted to-just as I had once planned with Philip or some other rich man.

Just as this thought crossed my mind, my phone's shrill ring interrupted my contemplation. Glancing at the caller ID with a frown, I saw it was my editor from the publishing house. I took a deep breath to compose myself,forcing my voice into a professional tone as I answered.

"Sarah, we discussed your children's book at the publishing house meeting.
" the voice on the other end said. "We've decided on an initialprint run of 500.000 copies. By the way, how many digital copies have you sold through your personal website?"


At that moment, a strange feeling rose in my chest. I stroked my swollen belly,suddenly realizing the significance of my hard work-even if every man in my life abandoned me someday. I would still be able to support myself. This sense of security was something no man could ever provide.

My fingers flew across the keyboard, pulling up my sales data page. With a hint of pride. I answered, "Over 350,000 copies."

"Are you sure that number is accurate?" The editor's tone carried obvious skepticism, as if I were exaggerating.

This doubt made my face instantly flush with heat, a vein in my forehead subtly pulsing. I clenched my jaw, fighting the urge to explode, and opted for an icy response instead: "Of course I'm sure. If you don't believe me,you can verify it yourself."

Silence fell on the other end of the line, and I could hear keyboard clicks.My fingers impatiently tapped on the desk surface as I waited for a response.


"That's indeed correct, and the numbers are still growing," the editor replied,surprisè evident in his voice.


I couldn't help but smile, a wave of accomplishment washing over me. "Is there a problem?" I asked, knowing full well there wasn't, savoring the surprise in his words.

"No problem at all," the editor replied casually. "Once we get final approval,we'll begin printing, After all 500,000 copies are sold, we'll consider additional print runs." They were underestimating me! 500,000 copies? Hat I could sell that in two weeks. These people always underestimated me, but now I'd proven them wrong with cold, hard numbers. It felt exhilarating!

"Considering you've covered most of the promotional costs, the company is willing to offer you a 20% profit share," the editor continued.

Twenty percent. My heart skipped a beat. This figure immediately formed a contrast with another number: 15%. That was Annie Baker's share.This meant that for the same number of publications, I would earn 5% more than her. A complex sense of superiority spread through me-regardless of other aspects of life, at least in this domain, I was doing better than her.

"Fine." I replied. gripping the phone so tightly my knuckles turned white,"that works for me."


After ending the call, I practically collapsed onto the sofa, trembling with excitement as a wave of dizziness swept over me. I began rapidly calculating my income on paper. Unlike Annie, I owned all rights to my work and managed aIl details myself. This meant that, if I wanted, I could invest in marketing once and boost sales of both the book and related merchandise.


Each number I wrote down accelerated my heartbeat. Without realizing it,I seemed to have found a path that truly suited me. My fingers tapped on the calculator, each press like a blow against Annie's so-called perfect life.

More importantly, even if my merchandise sales matched Annie's, I would earn significantly more than her. Because after deducting costs, all remaining profits from merchandise sales were mine alone,without having to share with Howard Thompson's team as she did.

From this perspective. Annie's so-called life of "just focusing on quality" suddenly seemed less enviable. In reality, after deducting production costs and shipping personnel expenses, my net profit was approximately 50%.while hers might only be around 15%.
I jumped to my feet, nearly shouting with joy. Earning more than twice what Annie made! This realization filled me with power. like I'd been injected with some potent stimulant. I paced around the living room.hands caressing my pregnant belly, experiencing a sense of control I'd never felt before. This feeling of security and independence that money brought made every cell in my body sing-this sensation of not depending on anyone was even more wonderful than I had imagined.

As night fel1. Manhattan's lights filtered through the windows into my apartment. I stared at the calendar on my phone, my eyes stinging at the bright red cancellation mark. Two days ago, Robert had suddenly canceled our date without even providing a decent reason.

"Something came up. Can't make it." That simple sentence negated all my expectations and preparations.

My fingers gripped my phone tightly, knuckles whitening with the pressure. This feeling of being controlled by someone else was suffocating-I hated it, hated having to accommodate others' schedules and decisions, hated not being in control of the situation.

"Enough!" I sat up straight, driven by a powerful urge to take action. I was no longer the Sarah who waited for others to spare their time for me.
I had money, a career, and capability. Now it was my turn to take control.

I opened my chat history with Robert and quickly typed several messages:

"How have you been lately?" "Are you short on cash?"

"I've been making good money recently. Need any help?"

After sending these messages, I set down my phone, feeling a strange satisfaction. Establishing control through money was the method I knew best. Once Robert needed my help, the dynamics would shift-he would contact me proactively, perhaps even beg to see me.

I gently stroked my belly, feeling the movement of life within. "Don't worry,baby." I whispered, "Mommy has learned how to take control. You'Il see, we don't need to depend on anyone at all."
###Chapter 192: Can You Give Me Half of All YourAssets?
Rotent'sPOV

My phone rang with the display showing an incoming call from Howard Technologies. Answering it. a calm femate voice briefly said. "Mr. Johnson please come to the company."

"I'm Susan Moore. Mr. Thompson's secretary," she added.


I hesitated for a moment, but agreed. "Alright, I'll be there soon."

An hour later, I stood in front of the gleaming Howard Technologies headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. Pushing through the revolving door.I saw Susan Moore already waiting in the lobby. Her short, neat haircut and meticulously tailored business suit gave her a sharp, professional appearance.


"Mr. Johnson, please follow me." She nodded politely, skipping unnecessary small talk, and led me through the security area toward the elevator.

As the elevator ascended, I couldn't help asking, "Is Mr. Thompson in the office today?"

"He has other arrangements," Susan replied briefly, "but he's prepared everything for you."

When the elevator doors opened, Susan guided me through an open office space that was minimalist yet elegant, with floor-to-ceiling windows flooding the entire area with Manhattan sunlight. These employees were specifically recvuited for yowr protect/ susan explatned. They're all experts in their respective fetds. with prior experience managing Independent projects.
I lnoked around, notcing several curiouas faces glancing in my direction."Then why would they be willing to work here? I couldn't help asking.
Susan smiled slightly. In Manhattan's tech industry, age discrimination is the norm.Howard Technologies is different-we value talent and ability rather than age. Mr. Thompson specifically emphasized assembling an experienced team for you."
Hearing this, I felt a wave of warmth spread through me. After my family business went bankrupt, few people were willing to give me this kind of opportunity.let alone provide me with a professional team.

"Let's meet the team first," I said, walking toward the waiting employees.

After introducing myself. I briefly described the project's vision. To my surprise, each person proactively identified the areas they could take responsibility for, and their understanding of the project far exceeded my expectations. In just twenty minutes of conversation, I discovered the team was already capable of operating independently, needing only my direction.

All of this had been arranged by Howard.

Next, Susan showed me around the entire office area, finally stopping in front of a spacious office. "This is your office," she said, opening the door.

I walked in and was stunned by the sight. The office was much larger than I had anticipated, with an entire wall of floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Manhattan's cityscape. The desk was made of imported hardwood,several minimalist modern art pieces hung on the walls, and there was even a small seating area with sofas in the corner.

"All equipment has been set up and tested," Susan said. pointing to the computer on the desk. "Your account and password for the company's internal system are in this envelope. If you have any questions,feel free to contact me anytime."

I sat in the comfortable office chair, feeling the sunlight warming my face throughthe windows. "Thank you, Susan, and please express my gratitude to Mr. Thompson as well."

Susan nodded, her lips finally curving into a slight smile. "Howard Technologies values every partner. I believe you'll enjoy the working environment here."

After Susan left, I looked around the luxurious office,involuntarily recalling my office at our family company's Long Island headquarters before the bankruptcy. How arrogant and self-important I had been back then,how unappreciative of what I had. Now, having lost everything.Howard was willing to give me this opportunity. This trust felt incredibly precious.

Thinking of Howard naturally made me think of Annie Baker. She had once kindly advised me against taking risks,to cherish what I had,but I couldn't listen at the time. Now both Howard and Annie had given me a chance to start over, yet I had promised Sarah I would reconcile with her,which undoubtedly meant standing agains Annie. Realizing this, a sense of guilt washed over me. Howard trusted me, Annie had helped me, and I might be betraying their kindness. This feeling of conflict made me clench my fists-I neededto make better choices and not repeat past mistakes.

As I was lost in thought, my phone vibrated. Looking at it, I saw a message from Sarah:

 "How have you been lately? Are you short on cash? I've been making good money recently. Need any help?"
I stared at the screen, frowning involuntarily. Sarah's suidden concern put me on alert. Since the time I acted as Howard's proxy to test her sincerity,
I had gained a clear understanding of her two-faced behavior.

I took a deep breath and thought calmly. Howard had given me a chance to start over, and Sarah's friendliness now represented...what exactly?
I decided to probe her true intentions. I replied: "I'm at Howard Technologies, just in a meeting, didn't see your message."
After sending that, I added: "Are you sure you're willing to provide me with financial support?"

I set down my phone and gazed out the window. This wasn't Sarah's usual style.

This unexpected generosity made me suspicious. A few minutes later,my phone vibrated again.

"How much do you need?"

Calmly, I replied: "How much can you offer?"


Seeing this message, I couldn't help but smirk. I clearly remembered that during the most difficult period of our marriage, when the Johnson family company was on the brink of collapse, Sarah refused to use any of her savings to help us through thecrisis, ultimately choosing to leave. Now she was suddenly generous?

Half challenging,half mocking. I replied: "Can you give me half of all your assets?" I didn't expect her to agree at all; I just wanted to see how she would back out. To my surprise, Sarah quickly responded:
"Sure,send me your account number."

I sent over my bank account details, certain she wouldn't actually transfer the money.

"Wait a bit. I'm going to process the transfer," she replied.

"Thank you." I answered briefly.

"You're welcome," Sarah's response was equally brief.

Back to work, my thoughts were scattered. Sarah being willing to share account information was one thing, but would she really give me that much money? If she actually made the transfer, what would it mean?

I tapped lightly on the keyboard, contemplating 'the implications behind this question. Sarah never made investments without returns. If she really gave me this money, she would certainly expect something in return-perhaps rekindling our relationship, perhaps expecting me to stand on her side against Annie.

This put me in a dilemma. Howard and Annie had given me a chance to start over,giving me dignity and trust. If I accepted Sarah's money, would it mean betraying them? Would I really stand against Annie for money?

Just as I was struggling internally, my phone suddenly emitted a crisp notification sound.

###Chapter 193: The True Cost of Trust

Sarah's POV

I stared anxiously at my phone screen, waiting for a response. It had been about thirty minutes since Robert had replied. "I was in a meeting, didn't see your message."


When he asked, "Are you sure you're willing to provide me with financial support?" I already had a plan forming in my mind. This was the perfect opportunity to regain control over Robert while simultaneously creating more chances to connect with Howard.

My phone suddenly chimed with a notification-a banking alert. Transfer complete.


I gasped sharply, the coffee spoon slipping from my fingers and splashing into the cup, sending small brown droplets onto my sleeve. God,that was half of my assets! Watching my bank balance plummet sent my heart pounding like a drum. All that money...just gone?

I grabbed a napkin to dab at my sleeve, my thoughts a jumbled mess.Why did I do something so risky? Had I lost my mind? But then again,sometimes you have to make bold moves. What's gambling without stakes?I poured myself another cup of coffee, took a deep breath, and my fingers steadied themselves. This was a necessary cost. If I wanted Robert to have a change of heart, if I wanted to establish a connection with Howard, this money was an essential bargaining chip.

I quickly sent Robert a mnessage: "I've transferred the money. Check if you've received it."

His reply came swiftly and irritatingly brief: "Received." 
"Is that all?" I couldn't help throwing my spoon into the sink with a sharp clatter.God,how had I never noticed how cold this man could be? Just a simple "received" and that's it? I clenched my teeth,muttering to myself in the empty kitchen. "You used to do anything for a smile from me.and now I give you half my fortune and get two words in return."
I stared at my phone screen, gently tapping the table. This money served multiple purposes: it could help me regain Robert's trust, give me a new reason to approach Howard, and most importantly. if Robert truly loved me. he would likely return the money-the best proof of his genuine feelings.

I admit, part of me was worried-what if he actually kept the money? But 1 quickly reassured myself: Robert knows my character; he understands I wouldn't easily make such a significant sacrifice. If he kept it, that still meant our relationship had a chance for reconciliation.

I took a deep breath and leaned back in my chair. This wasn't a foolish decision, regardless of the outcome. If Robert refused, I would appear incredibly generous; if he accepted, it would increase his sense of indebtedness to me; if he returned the money, it would prove his feelings for me remained. A win-win-win strategy.

I leaned forward, resting my head on the table, my face contorted with displeasure.

I calculated various possibilities in my mind: if Robert's project succeeded,even if my plans with Howard failed to materialize, even if Philip abandoned me completely, I would still maintain financial security.This was an insurance strategy while also a way to rebuild connections. After all.relationships with money involved are typically harder to sever.

At that moment, my phone chimed again with a message from Robert:" 
Having regrets?"

My heart raced. This was exactly what I'd been hoping for-he still cared about my feelings. My fingers quiekly typed "Yes," but I deleted it before sending. Appearing too eager would weaken my position. I needed to maintain composure and control.

While I hesitated. Robert sent another message: "I can transfer the money back to you."


My eyes lit up! He was offering to return it voluntarily! I could barely contain the wild joy inside me, almost laughing out loud. Wasn't this exactly what I'd been hoping for? Robert still had feelings for me!

But immediately, my expression cooled. No, accepting too quickly would undo everything. This game had only just begun, and I needed to stay level-headed.


I grabbed a tissue to wipe strawberry juice from my hands and continued waiting.


Robert sent another message: "We were once married, you should know me. You don't need to lie to me. If you don't want to give me money, there's no need to force yourself."


Listen to how considerate he sounds. I grinned. Sure enough, with just a little teasing, an honest man reveals his true heart.

After brief consideration, I calmly replied: "It's not necessary."

I pressed send and continued cutting my fruit, though my heart was racing. I could almost picture Robert's expression upon seeing this message-he would certainly be shocked.
My phone chimed again. Robert pressed further: "If you don't take it back now,you won't have a chance to change your mind. As you know. I'm starting a business. Once I invest your money in the company, if the project fails. I won't be able to pay you back even if I wanted to."
My hand froze midair, the freshly washed apple rolling onto the table. God.half of my assets! What if it all went down the drain? My nails unconsciously dug into my palm. But then I remembered this game was always high-risk, high-reward. Even if it failed,I still had my own work,my talent. my newly secured publishing contract-one bigger than Annie Baker's.

I arranged the cut fruit on a plate, picked up my phone, thought for a moment, and sent Howard a message: "Are you familiar with the project Robert is working on?"

This simple message was like a fishing line, with bait carefully placed,just waiting for Howard to take it. It would not only help me understand the true prospects of Robert's project but also lay groundwork for further communication with Howard.

I bit into an apple slice, leaning against the kitchen counter,gazing at Manhattan's night view through the window.

Sarah Johnson,you've placed your bet. Now it's time to wait and see how this game unfolds. Whatever the result, at least I'm no longer the passive party.
###Chapter 194: Thank You

Robert's POV

I sat in my new office at Howard Technologies, staring at my phone screen.
The notification of Sarah's substantial bank transfer still displayed prominently. This should have elated me, bat instead. I felt strangely calm.The modern office with its floor-to-ceiling windows flooding the space with Manhattan sunlight seemed at odds with my troubled thoughts.


Half of Sarah's assets now rested in my account. The amount was significant-enough to make a real difference for my new business venture.Yet something felt off. The Sarah I knew had never been generous without reason. During the darkest days of my family company's collapse,she had refused to help financially, instead choosing to leave. Now she was suddenly willing to transfer such a large sum?

A soft chime interrupted my thoughts. It was Howard's personal phone-the one he had entrusted to me for our arrangement. I picked it up and saw a message from Sarah: "Are you familiar with the project Robert is working on?"


A smile tugged at the corner of my mouth. How interesting. Sarah had just transferred a substantial amount of money to me, and she was already reaching out to Howard to verify the project's viability. This behavior aligned perfectly with her character, but it still stirred a sense of disappointment within me. Perhaps in her eyes, I would never be worthy of trust.

I held Howard's phone, considering how to respond as him. After a moment of thought, I typed: "Do you think a trust fund kid who grew up sheltered, with no work experience, suddenly taking on a new project will
 have a high success rate?"

My heart rate quickened slightly. This was a test for Sarah, probing her true opinion of me. If she genuinely cared, how would she respond?

The phone lit up quickly. Sarah's reply appeared: "No. the success rate wouldIn't be high. So why are you willing to dnvest in him?"

I stared at the screen, a complex wave of emotions washing over me. She had agreed with the negative assessment without hesitation. I had expected her to defend me, at least nominally, but she hadn't. This confirmed once again that Sarah had never truly believed in my abilities.

"Although the Johnson family company went bankrupt, their network connections still hold value," I replied, mimicking Howard's pragmatic thinking.

She responded immediately: "You want to use Robert's connections?"

I set Howard's phone down without replying further. Honestly,her answer left a bitter taste in my mouth. My family's connections? Where were those so-called "connections" when our company was on the brink of bankruptcy? If they had been as valuable as she implied, I wouldn't have fallen to this position in the first place.


Shortly afterward, my personal phone received a message from Sarah: "Why don't you return the money to me?"


A soft laugh escaped me. Just one statement from "Howard" had sent her into a panic. This woman, whom I once considered the most important person in my life, was so easily manipulated. I felt both dlisappointed and relieved,realizing how flimsy my position in her heart truly was.

Without hesitation,I asked for her banking information and immediately transferred all the money back to her. The funds had remained in my account for less than three hours. Once. I had dreamed of rebuilding a relationship with Sarah, believing there was still a possibility between us.But now. I only felt a sense of lightness,as if a long-carried burden had been lifted from my shoulders.

Upon returning home that evening. I sent Sarah a message: "Check if you've received the money."


Her reply was brief: "Received."


I stared at this single word, feeling its coldness. Once, Sarah's every message had been full of life; now, only utilitarian brevity remained. I decided to try once more, to see if she still harbored any genuine concern for me.


"If you need any help in the future, just let me know. If I can help, I certainly will," I wrote, hoping to see some warmth in her response.

"Okay. I have a lot of work to handle now. I need to get back to work,"she replied almost immediately, ending the conversation with a businesslike tone.


I set down my phone as a wave of emptiness washed over me. Howard had warned me about Sarah's true nature, bout I had been unwilling to believe it. Now, the truth stood clearly before me. Sarah had never truly loved me;she only loved herself.

Just as I was preparing to put this relationship behind me,my phone lit up again. Sarah had sent another message:"I'm curious why you were willing to return the money to me. Aren't you short on cash? Wouldn't it be better to keep my money to develop your business?" I gazed at this message, suddenly understanding her intention. She wasn't genuinely concerned about me; she had begun to doubt what "Howard"had told her. She had detected a contradiction and started to suspect that my project might actually have value.

A thought flashed through my mind. Perhaps this was the last chance to test whether Sarah truly cared about me, rather than just her own interests.
I decided to give her a perfect excuse, to see how she would respond.

"Of course that would be better. But Sarah, we already have one child together. And now you have another one in your belly. While thinking about myself. I also need to consider you and our children. If this project succeeds, that's great. But what if I fail? I can continue to live a hard life.But what about you and the children? Would you struggle alongside me?"

After sending this message. I felt an inner calm. Not because I expected any particular response, but because I had finally allowed myself to face reality. Regardless of Sarah's answer, I already knew the truth.

"Thank you," her reply came, simple and swift.


Just that? No emotion, no genuine expression of feeling? I stared at these two words, finally letting go completely. Sarah had never truly cared about me, and even now, her response came only because her interests had been satisfied.


"It's what I should do," I replied calmly.
###Chapter 195: That's Different

Howard's POV

I stood with Annie backstage in the school auditorium,watching Lucy run toward us through the dispersing crowd. The performance had just ended,and the hall echoed with excited chatter and laughter.

Annie's mother Ruth had departed moments ago to pick up Brian, leaving us to wait for Lucy. Despite the bustling crowd, Lucy's bright smile stood out like a beacon as she weaved between parents and children.

"Mom! How was I?" Lucy asked Annie excitedly, her eyes sparkling with anticipation. Her cheeks were still flushed from the excitement of being on stage, and wisps of golden hair had escaped from her carefully styled princess hairdo.

Annie gave her an enthusiastic thumbs up, her face radiating pride. "You were absolutely brilliant!"

"You know," Annie continued, gently brushing Lucy's hair back into place,"watching you from the audience was like seeing a star shining on stage.I kept thinking, 'This amazing girl is my daughter, how lucky amI?”"

Lucy looked slightly embarrassed but pleased, burying her face in Annie's embrace. "Mom, you don't have to exaggerate."


"I mean it," Annie said affectionately, her voice warm with sincerity. "Were you nervous up there?"


"A little," Lucy admitted honestly, looking up at Annie. "But then I remembered what you told me about imagining the audience as toy dolls.and it got much better." Watching this tender exchange, a powerful wave of emotion suddenly washed over me. Initially. I thought it was simply joy at seeing Lucy's progress-six months ago when Annie first met her. Lucy would barely speak to anyone, and now she was confidently hosting ain entire event and finding her own ways to overcome stage fright.
But this feeling was much more than that. It was the concentrated warmth of family bonds forming and strengthening before my eyes. I realized with sudden clarity that since my brother William and his wife passed away.I hadn't experienced this kind of intimate family connection.
Yet since Annie's arrival, these moments had been occurring with increasing frequency in our lives.
"Our Lucy knows how to solve problems!" Annie kissed her forehead proudly. "That's my girl!"
I held up the camera, capturing this natural and intimate moment between them. "What would you like to do now?" I asked Lucy.

Lucy thought for a moment, her expression turning contemplative. "Aren't we going away with Grandpa and Grandma this weekend? I need to go home and organize my things."

She turned to Penny who was standing nearby with Sue. "You too-I'll see you at my house tonight."

Penny nodded enthusiastically, then departed with her mother Sue, both waving goodbye as they joined the stream of families heading toward the exit.

Lucy tugged at Annie's hand. "Mom, let's go home."

Back at our Long Island home, the evening passed quickly with dinner and bedtime routines. Luacy couldn't stop talking about the upcoming weekend trip, her excitement bubbling over as she described all the activities she was looking forward to. Before bedtime, she even called Penny to confirm their plans for the next day.
The following morning, Lucy was upstairs packing the last of her belongings for the weekend trip with her maternal grandparents,Edward and Eleanor Parker.Eleanor was helping her organize her clothes, making sure everything was properly packed and nothing important forgotten.
I brewed coffee in the kitchen and carried two mugs to the terrace, where Edward was standing. He was an elegant man in his mid-fifties, staying with us these past few days in preparation for the weekend trip.

"Good morning," I offered him a cup of coffee.

"Thank you." he accepted the coffee, took a sip, and then asked directly."How are things going with you and Annie?"
His straightforward question caught me slightly off guard.I considered my response before answering simply, "Very well." Though brief, it was true.Annie had been living in our home for several months now, our relationship was developing steadily, and Lucy had grown increasingly attached to her.


Edward smiled knowingly. "We're taking Lucy for the weekend, so you should make good use of this time with Annie. When the child is around.you both focus your attention on Lucy. You don't really have time just for the two of you."

I shook my head slightly. "It's not like that. We spend time together at the company as well." "That's different." Edward remarked with a meaningful look, though he didn't elaborate further.
Lucy's voice calledI from upstairs, "Grandpa! I'm ready!"

"Coming!" Edward called back, then turned to me and patted my shoulder.
"Trust me, make good use of this weekend."

I couldn't help feeling somewhat awkward at his suggestion but nodded. "I will."

Shortly afterward, Edward, Eleanor, and Lucy were at the door with their luggage,ready to depart. Lucy hugged Annie tightly and kissed her cheek."See you Sunday,Mom!"

We stood at the entrance, watching their car drive away. Lucy waved excitedly from the back seat until the vehicle turned the corner and disappeared from view.

Suddenly, the spacious living room contained only Annie and me. The house was eerily quiet, the space that was usually filled with Lucy's laughter and energy now feeling unusually empty. The sensation was unfamiliar-since Annie had moved in, the three of us had almost always spent weekends together.

I walked over to Annie, feeling a slight awkwardness. "Finally, we have some time to ourselves."

Annie smiled softly but then said, "I've accumulated quite a bit of work these past few days. I think I'll go take care of some of it first, so it doesn't affect my schedule next week."

A flicker of disappointment passed through me, but I understood the importance of her work. Annie's children's book illustrations had been gaining popularity recently, and she was passionate about her career.Forcing her to set aside her work would only make her uncomfortable.
It's fine. We've got a whole week, I told myself inwardly.


"Of course," I replied simply. "Would you like some coffee?"

"That would be wonderful, thank you."


Annie headed upstairs to her studio, while I walked toward the kitchen.I found myself appreciating this feeling-no outsiders, no phone conferences,no busy schedules, just the two of us in this house.

Alone,yet together. Perhaps this was the "different" that Edward had mentioned.
###Chapter 196: She Will Come

Philip's POV

I forced my heavy eyelids open, momentarily disoriented about what time it was. The distant sounds of Manhattan traffic filtered through the windows, but my apartment was eerily silent. I reached for the bottle beside me, giving it a half-hearted shake. Empty.
The scattered collection of bottles surrounding me told the silent story of the past few days. Since my divorce from Annie, alcohol had become my most faithful companion. I'd rented an apartment with a layout similar to the home we once shared, but this place held no Annie, no Brian-just me and an army of empty bottles.

"Philip Baker, look at what you've become."

I jerked my head up to see Annie standing in the center of the living room.hands on her hips, a slight frown creasing her forehead. She wore that light blue sweater I always loved,her hair falling loosely around her shoulders.


"Annie?" My voice emerged as a raspy whisper, barely recognizable even to myself. "How did you get in here?"

She shook her head disapprovingly and moved closer, bending down to start gathering the bottles from the floor. "Are you trying to drink yourself to death?"

"I thought you'd be inseparable from Howard by now," I attempted to sound casual, but the bitterness in my words was impossible to disguise.

Annie methodically placed the bottles into a garbage bag, her movements fluid and practiced-mesmerizing to watch. This was so characteristic of her-even when angry, she would always tidy up before speaking her mind.
"You need some sobering-up soup," she announced, straightening up and heading toward the kitchen.
"Wait," I struggled to my feet, swaying as I stood, "don't go."

Annie paused, turning to look at me with a gentleness in her eyes I hadn't seen in ages. "I'mjust going to the kitchen."

"Will you stay?"I summoned the courage to ask.

She didn't answer, simply continuing her path to the kitchen. I stumbled after her, reaching out to grasp her wrist-but my hand passed right through her body.

Annie vanished.

I stood in the middle of the empty kitchen, suddenly realizing everything had been an alcohol-induced hallucination. Annie had never been here.She was now with Howard and that little girl-Lucy-living the life I once had but had destroyed with my own hands.

I collapsed heavily onto the cold kitchen floor, the physical pain in my knees nothing compared to the hollowness in my chest. My hands hung limply at my sides, fingertips trembling. My throat constricted, making it difficult to breathe. Tears I couldn't control spilled from my eyes, hot liquid coursing down my cheeks, gathering at my chin before dropping onto my wrinkled shirt.

"Annie, please, don't leave me..." My voice came out broken, as if from a great distance. I clutched at my hair, pressing my forehead against the cool cabinet door. I knew she wasn't here, knew this was all just the alcohol playing cruel tricks on my mind. yet 1 called her namelike a drowning man grasping at his final straw. The desperation felt both ridiculous and tragic, but I couldn't stop myself.
"Annie!"

I don't know how much time passed before I heard the doorbell,followed by the sound of a key turning in the lock. I didn't have the strength to get up,so I remained slumped against the kitchen cabinets, lost in my personal hell.

"Annie, just one more chance..." I mumbled to myself.

"Annie Baker,since you've already left my son, stay away from him!" My mother Betty's sharp voice carried from the entryway. "Why are you sneaking into my son's home? Isn't being with Howard enough? Do you still want to lead my son around by the nose?"

I heard the sound of the door locking. Betty must have thought Annie was actually here.

"Mom," I called out weakly, "there's nobody else here."

Rapid footsteps approached from the hallway. Betty appeared in the kitchen doorway, her meticulously styled hair and impeccable makeup creating a stark contrast with the chaotic environment. When she saw my disheveled state, shock flashed across her face.

"Philip? Why are you sitting on the floor?" She glanced around the kitchen."Where's Annie? I just heard you calling her name."

"I told you, there's nobody else here." I shook my head, attempting to stand but finding my legs uncooperative. Betty rushed forward to support me.

"Then what did I just hear? You were clearly talking to Annie."

"I was just talking to myself." I allowed her to help me back to the living room sofa.

Betty's gaze swept over the bottles littering the floor and the general disarray of the apartment, her expression shifting from shock to anger."Look what you've done to yourself! All because of that woman!"
"This isn't Annie's fault," I said quietly. "I'm the one who wronged her."

Betty sat beside me, stroking my hair as she used to when I was a child."Philip, is Annie really worth all this? She's already with Howard, and here you are, heartbroken over her."

I looked up at my mother, tears blurring my vision. "I don't know, Mom. I just know I can't control myself."

Betty's expression hardened with resolve. She stood up and pulled out her phone. "This won't do."

"What are you doing?" I asked, though I already suspected the answer.


Betty didn't respond. Instead, she dialed a number. I noticed she was using her backup phone-Annie had probably blocked her primary number.

"Oh, Annie, finally got through." Betty's voice suddenly turned cold. "Yes,it's me, Betty. No, I'm not interested in chatting. I'll send you an address,and you need to come immediately."

Annie, will you come? No, you must hate me completely. I'll never speak

to you again. "Why?" Betty repeated, her tone growing sharper. "Because my son is drinking himself into oblivion, and it's all because of you! You must come take care of him!"

"Mom!" I tried to stop her, but it was too late.

Betty ended the call and turned to me. "She wvill come."

I sank back into the sofa and closed my eyes. This wasn't what I wanted.I didn't want to see Annie this way. I didn't want her to visit out of pity or obligation. But I did want to see her-even if for the last time.

"I'm going to run you a bath," Betty's voice interrupted my thoughts. "You need to clean yourself up before Annie arrives."

I didn't answer, remaining slumped on the sofa,listening to my mother bustling around in the bathroom. I knew Annie probably wouldn't come,and if she did, it would only make things worse. Yet deep inside, a voice hoped,yearned to see her again, if only for a moment.

I couldn't control my longing for her, just as I couldn't control alcohol's grip on me. I had lost everything-my marriage, my son, and now possibly my dignity. Butif I could see Annie one more time, I'd pay any price.


Because without her, my life was like these empty bottles-once filled with promise, now just hollow shells.
###Chapter 197:I Am My Own Sky

Annie's POV

I had been immersed in my creative world for nearly an hour. The house was unusually quiet, with only the soft sound of my brush gliding across paper. Lucy and her maternal grandparents, the Parkers,had left for their weekend trip, leaving just Howard and me downstairs. This tranquility allowed me to focus with unprecedented clarity, my productivity noticeably higher than usual.

I added the final touch of color to my illustration and leaned back to admire my work with satisfaction. Just as I was about to stand and take a short break, my phone rang, shattering the room's peaceful atmosphere.I hesitated when I saw the unfamiliar number on the screen but decided to answer anyway.

"Hello?" I said softly.

"I'm sending you an address. Come over immediately." Betty Baker's tense voice came through, maintaining her characteristic commanding tone.

I couldn't help but smile. "Why would I go somewhere just because you send me an address?"

"Because my son Philip is drunk because of you!" Betty's voice was filled with anger. "Are you satisfied now?"

I frowned, perplexed by her unreasonable outburst. It was truly absurd.

"You must come take care of him!" Betty continued with her commanding tone. "This is all your fault. If you had been patient when he cheated, if you had continued to be a good wife, he would never have ended up like 
this! Do you understand?"

I could feel Betty's disdain for me radiating through the phone. She still maintained that superior attitude, apparently believing I was still her daughter-in-law who needed to obediently follow her orders. How ridiculous,

"No, I don't understand," I replied curtly, then hung up.


I placed the phone aside and took a deep breath. The call had somewhat dampened my good mood.

In less than a minute, my phone started ringing again. I stared at the illuminated screen, my finger hovering over the reject button. Betty's haughty face flashed in my mind-once, when I missed her call because I was showering,she had stormed to my doorstep and yelled in the hallway,disturbing half the floor of neighbors. This woman never backed down when pursuing her goals.

Reluctantly, I answered the phone again.

"You don't understand? Then let me explain these principles to you!"Betty fumed. "First of all, as a woman, you have absolutely no patience. In our generation, when husbands cheated, how many wives chose dlivorce?Didn't they all just continue with their lives, staying faithfully by their husbands' sides, waiting for them to come to their senses? How could you just divorce him so easily?"

Hearing this. I nearly choked on my own saliva. My God! How could she state such absurd notions with such conviction?

"In your generation, no one got divorced because of the limitations of that era," I said, feeling somewhat weary, "People didn't dare to divorce even when they suffered in their marriages. They were afraid of being pointed at and ridiculed. Most importantly, they had no income sources and feared they couldn't survive after divorce. But now, that era you speak of is gone."
I rose from my work chair and moved to the lounge area in the corner of the studio, settling into a comfortable armchair to relax a bit. I continued at a measured pace: "Now, everyone has their own job and can earn money. When you're no longer financially dependent on anyone, you naturally become independent. And I'm especially so."
I leaned back against the chair, my tone caIm but firm: "I don't care about others' opinions or what they say about me. Without Philip, I can still live very well."

Leaving him was one of the best decisions I'd ever made.

"So I have no reason to stay with Philip and suffer," I concluded.

Betty was clearly more infuriated on the other end: "So you're saying you won't take care of him? Annie, he's like this because of you!"

Betty's accusatory tone, the slight tremor in her voice when mentioning Philip, and even the faint clinking of bottles audible in the background all suggested Philip was completely intoxicated. But I refused to feel even a hint of guilt about it.

Betty was always like this-finding external reasons for each of her son's mistakes, and that reason was usually me. She would never admit that Philip's problems ultimately stemmed from her distorted indulgence.

"But all of this was his choice," I countered. "The affair was his choice.Pushing me to the edge when I was unconditionally compromising was also his choice. Since he chose this path..." I paused, keeping my voice
steady,"he should be responsible for his own choices."

This reminded me of Brian, and I continued: "Of course, I'll also be responsible for my choices. Betty, I never regret anything."
After a moment of silence, Betty took a deep breath,clearly adjusting her strategy: "In our circle, everyone says that a man is a woman's sky..."
I interrupted her before she could finish: "In my world, I amn my own sky."

Betty was momentarily speechless. These outdated notions had no traction with me.

"I won't listen to or believe in your way of thinking," I continued. "If that's all you wanted to tell me, you can hang up now."
I didn't hang up because I knewif Betty hadn't said enough, she would call back with a different number. Rather than being repeatedly disturbed,it was better to let her say everything at once.

Betty changed her approach: "You might be happy now,but have you thought about when you're older?"

This question made me pause for a moment. What would happen when I got older? I wasn't certain, but I knew one thing: "I have my own career and savings plan. Whatever happens, I'll be much better off than Philip is now."


I could sense Betty wanted to explode, but she also knew I was no longer her daughter-in-law who would meekly listen to her criticism. If she spoke too harshly, I could hang up at any time.

"But you've given up custody of Brian. When you're old,who will be by your side?" Betty asked, with a hint of triumph in her voice. What an absurd question. I answered calmly: "Betty, I have my own career,circle of friends, and retirement plans. And if I remember correctly,the custody Philip fought for in court has resulted in him leaving Brian with nannies and tuators, hardly ever showing up himself. What makes you think he'll fare better than me in the future?"
"That's because Sarah is pregnant," Betty said proudly. "The child is my son's. He'll have a new family and heir. After this child is born, my son will raise him properly."
Hearing this, I raised an eyebrow slightly. In truth, I wanted Philip to have a good relationship with the child more than anyone. Because the more Philip loved this child and the more hope he invested in it,the deeper his disappointment would be when the truth came to light. Thinking of this,I felt a complex sense of satisfaction.

Betty confidently continued: "Rest assured, his later years will definitely be better than yours."

"If that's the case, then there's no need for you to contact me, is there?" I replied with a hint of a smile. I still couldn't understand the purpose of this call. Did Betty really think a few words would make me have a change of heart and go back to take care of Philip? Ridiculous.

I was never the one who did wrong; I had no reason to feel guilty.

Betty clearly hadn't expected this response and was momentarily at a loss for words.

"He has you now, and Sarah. It's not my place as his ex-wife toger involved," I said, then hung up.

Setting my phone aside, I returned to my desk and looked at the recently completed illustration, feeling lighthearted again. What could be more satisfying than seeing yourself getting better while your ex-husband was getting worse?

Just as I was about to continue working, a gentle knock sounded at the door.

"Knock, knock, knock."

Everyone else had gone out, leaving only Howard and me in the house.
The person knocking could only be him.
###Chapter 198: It's Different

Annie's POV

"Knock, knock,knock."

I looked up to see Howard standing in the doorway, holding two cups of coffee.

"Sorry to disturb you," he said softly. "May I come in?"

"Of course," I smiled, setting down my paintbrush. The squabble with Betty seemed to have disappeared.

Howard walked into the studio with that natural elegance that seemed effortless for him. He placed one of the coffee cups on my work desk. As he leaned down, I noticed his sleeves were casually rolled up, revealing his strong forearms. The muscle definition was smooth yet powerful, and a fleeting thought crossed my mind that they might be too thick to encircle with both hands. This sudden observation made my throat inexplicably dry.

Instead of turning to leave, he remained standing quietly,his gaze falling on the illustration I had just completed.

"It's beautiful," he said simply, his voice deep and sincere.

"Thank you," I replied softly, carefully picking up the coffee cup to hide the unexpected nervousness I felt. The hot liquid slid down my throat,spreading warmth through my chest, but the heat seemed to come from more than just the coffee.

The studio was unusually quiet, with only the sound of our breathing gently echoing in the space.
Howard walked toward the lounge area in the corner of the studio.His broad shoulders moved slightly with each step, his back straight as a shield. I suddenly had an urge to lean against it, to know what it would feel like to press my face against that solid back, to feel if his body heat would transfer through his shirt to my cheek. This unexpected thought made me blush to the roots of my hair.
After sitting down, he patted the empty space beside him. "Care to join me for a bit?"

I set down my brush and walked toward him. Each step made my heart beat a little faster.

"Is something wrong?" I asked as I sat down beside him, my voice softer than usual.

Howard shook his head, a simple and genuine smile appearing on his face.
"Nothing in particular. Just wanted to be with you like this."

That straightforward statement made my heart skip a beat.

The,everything in the studio fell silent. In this stillness, I suddenly heard a strong heartbeat. At first, I thought it was Howard's, but quickly realized it was my own heart pounding forcefully in my chest. The rhythm was unnaturally fast, almost making me dizzy.

Howard didn't speak, just looked at me intently, his gaze moving slowly from my eyes to my lips, then back to my eyes.

"Annie..." he murmured my name, his voice low and slightly hoarse.

I simply nodded slightly,

"May I?" he asked quietly, his voice clear in the silent studio.
"Mm-hmm..." my response was barely audible, but he seemed to understand.

He moved toward me slowly, his movements gentle yet determined.My breathing almost stopped, my heartbeat thundering in my ears. When his lips gently pressedl against mine, the world seemed to freeze in that instant.
His lips were warmer and softer than I had imagined, with the bitterness of coffee and a hint of indescribable sweetness.

The taste in his mouth was surprisingly pleasant, mixing with the coffee he had just drunk and a unique sweetness. The coffee flavor on my own lips blended with his, like fine chocolate-initially bitter, but becoming increasingly rich and sweet as it deepened. This taste was addictive,making me unconsciously move closer to him,wanting to explore more.

"I've wanted to do this for a long time," he whispered against my lips when we briefly parted, his breath warm against my skin.

"So have I," I responded softly, my voice trembling slightly with emotion.

At some point, I found my breathing had become rapid and shallow. A strange heat began rising from my core, gradually spreading throughout my body.

Howard seemed to notice my change; his gaze became even more focused.

My eyes involuntarily fell on his lips, those clearly defined lines now looking particularly attractive. I felt my body leaning toward him unconsciously.

Howard turned slightly, further reducing the distance between us. I could feel his breath gently brushing my cheek, warm and heart-quickening.

My heart was beating violently in my chest; I could almost hear the  sound of blood rushing in my ears. Every cell in my body seemed to be awakening,responding,yearning. This feeling was both familiar and strange, making me both nervous and expectant.
My breathing became rapid, and my hand moved instinctively to Howard's tie, gently pulling to undo it, letting it slide fromn his shirt collar.
"Slow down, Annie." Howard grasped my wrist, his voice deep and firm.He took the lead, his long fingers brushing the hair by my ear, gently tucking it behind.

He leaned forward, kissing the corner of my lips,then my chin, and finally my neck. My hands restlessly unbuttoned his white shirt, and when I touched his warm skin, I could feel the powerful heartbeat beneath his chest. HowardI's breathing became heavier; his self-control was gradually being worn away.

He pushed me toward the sofa, his movements both urgent and restrained.My cardigan had somehow already fallen to the floor, and Howard's palm moved across my waist through my thin silk blouse, causing me to tremble involuntarily. I couldn't help but let out a soft sigh, a sound thatseemed to break Howard's last bit of rationality.

"It's just the two of us now," he whispered, his fingers skillfully unbuttoning my blouse, gradually revealing the skin underneath.

When his palm covered my chest, I arched my body to meet his touch.Howard's lips landed on my collarbone, his tongue lightly tracing the lines there, making my breathing even more rapid. My fingers threaded through his thick black hair, feeling its texture between my fingers.

Soon, my blouse joined the pile of clothes on the floor. Howard's gaze intensely scanned my half-naked upper body, the focus in his eyes making
me feel both shy and excited. His fingers hooked into my belt,both asking for permission and slowly unfastening it.
"Are you sure?" he asked, his voice husky.

My response was an initiated kiss. My lips and tongue intertwined with his, my hands moving across his back, feeling the contours and strength of his muscles. Howard carefully removed my last piece of clothing, his fingertips deliberately brushing the sensitive skin of my inner thigh,causing me to shudder.

"You're so beautiful," he gazed at me, his palm sliding up from my calf,lingering momentarily at the hollow of my knee, then continuing to explore my inner thigh.

I eagerly helped him remove his remaining clothes.

Howard's lips started at my neck and moved downward, lingering on my chest, the alternating use of his tongue and teeth making me tremble continuously. When his kisses continued downward, reaching my most private area, I couldn't help but gasp, my hands tightly gripping the sofa cushion.

His tongue skillfully teased my most sensitive spot, causing pleasure to surge like a tide. My thighs unconsciously tensed, my toes curled,feeling that gradually accumulating pleasure. Just as I was about to reach my peak,Howard looked up, meeting my gaze.

"I want to see your eyes," he said, slowly and firmly entering my body.

The feeling of completeness at that moment made me moan uncontrollably.Howard's initial movements were slow and controlled, allowing me to adjust to his presence. I could feel his shape and pulse inside me. As the rhythm gradually quickened, my legs wrapped around his waist,pulling him closer. One of Howard's hands caressed my chest, while the other supported my hips, making each connection deeper. His sweat dripped onto my collarbone, sliding down my skin toward my chest.
A wave of pleasure came unexpectedly, spreading like lightning from deep in my abdomen throughout my body. My back arched involuntarily,my hands seeking support on Howard's shoulders. My body wrapped tightly around him, as if unwilling to let him leave even slightly.
"Oh my god..." I gasped, unable to control my voice.

Howard didn't rush to seek his own release, but slowed his movements,focusing intently on my expressions. His thumb gently brushed over my trembling lower lip, as if recording every subtle reaction. This feelingof being treasured was intoxicating.

Just as my breathing began to steady, he suddenly changed tactics, one hand sliding to where we were connected, his fingertips lightly circling.This unexpected stimulation made me inhale sharply, my legs tensing involuntarily.

"You can take more," he said, not a question but a confident statement.


Howard began a new round of movement, this time with a more complex rhythm, sometimes slow and deep, sometimes quick and shallow. His palm lifted one of my thighs, changing the angle of our connection,making each contact rub perfectly against my most sensitive spot.

My senses were completely ignited, my thoughts becoming blurry. I felt like I was standing on the edge of a cliff,both wanting to jump off to experience that ultimate pleasure, and wanting to stay forever in this sweet torture, Howard seemed to precisely control this balance, pushing me to theedge again and again, then pulling me back at the crucial moment.
"Howard, please..." I looed at him half-pleadingly, not even sure what I was asking for.
He bent down to kiss my neck, while suddenly speeding up the rhythm.My hands gripped his arms tightly.
This climax was more intense than the first, like wave after wave of ocean swells. My consciousness seemed to drift briefly, leaving only the most primitive feelings of my body and the warmth of Howard's close connection with me.

Howard's breathing also became rapid, his movements losing their previous composure. I could feel him pulsing and expanding inside me,followed by a warm release, accompanied by his deep, ragged breathing.This feeling of being completely filled made my inner walls contract involuntarily again, extending the aftershocks of pleasure.

"Yeah, it's different," Howard said softly.
###Chapter 199: She Is Nothing Without a Man
Philip's POV

I forced myself to sit up, despite the violent throbbing in my temples.The empty bottles scattered around me told a story that filled me with shame.My mnother stood by the window, her designer handbag tucked tightly under her arm, clearly preparing to leave.
"Did you just call Annie?" I asked, my voice barely recognizable, hoarse from alcohol and silence.

Mother's posture stiffened slightly. "Yes," she answered simply.

Even that single syllable sent a wave of emotion through me-perhaps desperation, perhaps hope. Any connection to Annie, even indirect,was like oxygen to me.

"What did you talk about? What did she say?" I leaned forward, ignoring the stabbing pain behind my eyes.

Mother sighed dramatically, her perfectly manicured hand adjusting her diamond necklace-a nervous habit she'd had for years. "I don't know what Annie Baker's heart is made of. I told her about your condition,asked her to come take care of you, but she refused!" Her voice rose with indignation. "You were husband and wife,after all..."

A bitter laugh escaped my lips. "After everything I did, it's only natural she wouldn't forgive me."

My betrayal was undeniable. I had broken Annie's trust and love. I had been drawn to Sarah's allure, failing to cherish my marriage with Annie.Step by step, I'd allowed myself to falI into feelings I shouldn't have had, pushing Annie further away until she couldn't stand it anymore and left me,and now...

"Besides," I continued, "she probably never wants to see me again. Why would she come take care of a drunk?"
I felt moisture on my cheeks, realizing I was crying. How pathetic-a once-powerful Wall Street executive reducedto this, weeping over a woman he had abandoned.

"Looking like this, and you're still defending her?" Mother's voice carried that familiar sharp edge that used to make me straighten my back instantly as a child.

"Mom, please stop interfering in my affairs." Suddenly, I felt exhausted by her presence. "Ill handle my own problems. You should go home now."

She stood up immediately, her cheeks flushing. "How could I possibly do that? You're my only son!" Her voice trembled slightly. "To see you drowning your sorrows over a woman... do you know how painful this is for me?"

"I know." I closed my eyes, a fresh wave of pain unrelated to my hangover washing over me.

Annie's face flashed in my mind-how she used to organize our home,manage my social calendar, even categorize my wardrobe by color and season. I had taken it all for granted. Now that she was gone, it felt like someone had dug out part of my heart with a dull knife.

"In the past, I was your good son, always listening to you," I opened my eyes to look at my mother. "You said Annie was no good, that Sarah was better. I listened to you-I distanced myself from Annie, grew closer toSarah..."

I struggled to sit straighter, meeting her gaze directly. "And what happened? Annie left me and found someone better. And here I sit,missing her hopelessly!"

Mother shifted uncomfortably. "How was I supposed to know you liked Annie?" She adjusted her designer jacket. "You acted like you were just settling for Annie, that your heart was all for Sarah. If Annie hadn't been clinging to her position as your wife, you would have reconciled with Sarah long ago." She paused, then added, "I truly thought you loved Sarah.



I shook my head violently, a sharp pain washing through my entire body."Enough!" I almost shouted, my fist coming down hard on the sofa armrest. "This is all my fault! Never try to excuse me!"

My eyes burned, my voice shaking, "I'm a coward, a damn coward! No courage to face my own feelings, no backbone to resist temptation, no guts to fight for the life I truly wanted!" My breathing became heavy, my chest feeling like it was being gripped tightly, "I destroyed everything with my own hands..."


"You're only unhappy now because Annie found someone better after the divorce and is living a better life," Mother continued, her tone becoming defensive. "If she hadn't met Howard, if she were working as a waitress in some restaurant, washing dishes, would you still regret your actions?"

The image my mother painted flashed in my mind-Annie washing dishes in some restaurant while I drove by in a luxury car. The thought made my chest constrict painfully.

But even as the thought formed, I knew how absurd it was. A w oman like 
Annie would never end up in such a situation. With her Boston University education, emotional stability, and impeccable character, she could easily find work in any field she chose. Even withou Howard Thompson, Annie would thrive.

This thought brought another kind of pain. In every future scenario I could imagine. Annie realized she didn't need any man-especially me-and thoroughly moved on with her life.

"Just wait." Mother stood up, smoothing her skirt with decisive movements."Tomorrow morning I'll go to Howard's company and tell him to break up with Annie. Won't that solve everything?"

I almost laughed. Mother's confidence was almost comical-as if Howard Thompson, CEO of a successful tech company,would simply follow Betty Baker's instructions.

Too exhausted to argue further, I answered, "Fne,you go ahead."

Mother patted mny shoulder, her heavy perfume momentarily overpowering the stale alcohol smell permeating the apartment. "Look, Annie went straight from college to marrying you, and immediately attached herself to Howard after the divorce," she said in a lecuring tone. "What does that prove? Only that she can't live without a man."

She walked toward the door. "She claims to be independent and able to earn money, but that's only when she has a man sheltering her. Without a man, she is nothing."

The door closed behind her, and the apartment suddenly felt both vast and oppressive.

I stared blankly at the ceiling, tracing the faint water stain that had been there since I moved in. I felt like I was sick-no matter what I looked at,Annie's face would eventually appear in my vision. Her smile, her eyes, the way her nose slightly wrinkled when she spoke.

I closed my eyes, only to find her image becoming even clearer.
###Chapter 200: Just Another Game You're Bound to Win
Sarah's POV

My fingertips hovered over the screen for a moment beforeI finally dialed Philip's number. The red wine in my glass caught the light, glimmering softly as I took a sip and waited for the call to connect.

Ring.Ring. Ring.

After several rings, Philip's voice came through-hoarse and slurred. I immediately understood he was drunk again. What a weak man,only knowing how to numb himself with alcohol.

"Do you need something?" he asked, his tone as cold as if he were speaking to a stranger.

There was a time when this voice would have been elated to receive my call, but now it was so distant. A cold laugh rose within me, but I deliberately softened my voice. "Of course I do. I heard you haven't been doing well lately. Plus, you're the father of the child I'm carrying, so I wanted to check how you're doing. Are you alright?"

My finger casually traced the rim of my wine glass. This act of "concern"was a performance I'd mastered to perfection. In reality, I couldn't care less whether he lived or died-I only cared about his assets and securing my future.

"Actually, not great," his voice suddenly filled with genuine emotion. "I can't stop thinking about Annie. Since the divorce, I've realized how much I love her. I shouldn't have betrayed her, shouldn't have..." I rolled my eyes, my gaze falling on a painting hanging on the wall.It was a strange abstract piece with yellow and purple swirls intertwining,creating an unsettling visual. I started wondering why I'd bought such an ugly painting-probably recommended by some interior designer who thought they had artistic taste.

Philip continued rambling on the other end about how perfect Annie was,while I became completely absorbed in studying the painting's composition.Honestly, even a cat walking across a canvas would be more interesting than Philip's pathetic lamentations of regret. His voice became nothing more than background noise in my ear, like elevator music that lulls you to sleep.


I even began to imagine what it would be like to take down that painting and smash it over Philip's head-perhaps it might wake him up.

"Have you been drinking?" I forced mnyself to pull my attention away from the ugly painting, feigning concern.

"Just a little," Philip paused, his voice low. "Annie always said I become a different person when I'm drunk. She really knew me, and yet I..."

God, here we go again. I stifled a yawn, tapping my fingertips against the edge of my wine glass, counting the car lights passing by outside my window. One, two, three... far more interesting than listening to Philip go on about his ex-wife.

"I've told you before, I don't like men who drink," I cut him off abruptly,deliberately adding a whining quality to my voice. I needed to steer the conversation away from Annie, or this call would be pointless.

What would Philip say to placate me? Or would he offer a half-hearted apology? I waited, but what I heard instead sent a jolt through me. What does it matter to you? Sarah Johnson, I'm willing to support you only because you're the mother of my child, not because I love you."
His words hit me like a slap in the face, catching me off guard. Though I'd always known he didn't love me, hearing him say it aloud still made my stomach twist uncomfortably. I set down my wine glass and instinctively touched my belly. Damn it, this child isn't even his!

I took a deep breath, forcing myself to stay calm. I needed to maintain control of the situation, needed him to continue taking responsibility for me and this child.

"Do you really not love me at all anymore?" I deliberately made my voice tremble, even squeezing out a tear that slid down my cheek. This tear was for my owvn benefit-a performance I could admire.

Silence fell on the other end. I could imagine Philip's expression-brows furrowed, wrestling with inner conflict. He was always like this, wanting to appear resolute but afraid of hurting others. Such a weak man.

"I might still consider you a friend, but as for romantic feelings between us,there's absolutely nothing left."

Friend? I laughed wildly inside. The word meant nothing to me. I never believed in pure friendship between men and women-that was just an excuse for the weak.

"But this way..." my voice nearly choked, though the corners of my mouth turned up slightly, "makes me feel so insecure. You're already neglecting Brian because you're angry. What if one day, you decide to abandon me and our baby too?"

"What would happen to us then?" I continued applying pressure, filling my voice with helplessness. "Would I have to find another man to support us? Philip, I want my child to grow up in a stable environment."

Silence on the other end.

"I understand, of course," he finally answered after a long pause,resignation in his tone. "But Sarah. I've been drinking, and my mind is numb right now. Let's discuss this properly when I'm sober."

"Okay," I responded softly, still sounding hurt, but inwardly celebrating.The first step had succeeded!

Hanging up, I finished the wine in one gulp, savoring it while contemplating tonight's gains. Through this conversation,I'd confirmed several important things: Philip had completely severed ties with Brian;he had no feelings left for me; but he still felt responsible for "his child."

All good news, but there remained one critical issue to resolve: if Philip eventually discovers this child isn't his, he'll certainly find another woman to bear his true offspring. And to ensure Philip remains forever dependent on the "counterfeit" child in my womb, there's only one solution-render him completely incapable of fathering children.

This thought excited me immensely, a strange power surging from my spine straight to my brain. My heart raced, my cheeks flushed, like a hunter smelling blood duringtheir first kill. Yes, this was exactly the plan I needed!


I picked up my phone and quickly jotted down several key points in my notes app. Tomorrow when I meet Philip, I'll propose my "perfect"solution, and that poor fool will certainly take the bait.

Philip and Betty-that mother-son duo-would definitely be difficult to handle. But so what? I've seen too many self-important elite families like theirs, gleaming on the surface but riddled with weaknesses and secrets underneath. And finding and exploiting those weaknesses happens to be what I do best.

Standing before the mirror. I examined myself. My makeup remained flawless, and my eyes sparkled with cunning intelligence."Sarah Johnson."I whispered to myself, "this is just another game you're bound to win."

###Chapter 201: Sorry for the Disturbance

Philip's POV

The sound of the door closing echoed through my empty apartment.Mother had finally left, abandoning me to the company of scattered bottles strewn across the floor. I lay back on the sofa, my head pounding mercilessly, though compared to the agony in my heart, this physical pain hardly registered.

I stared at the faint water stain on the ceiling. It had been there since I moved in. The layout of this place was deliberately similar to the home I once shared with Annie-the only difference being the glaring absence of Annie and Brian.

Just me and these empty bottles.

I closed my eyes, allowing memories to wash over me like a relentless tide.Annie's face appeared vividly-her smile, her furrowed brow when concerned, her profile when focused on work. It suddenly dawned on me that throughout our entire marriage, Annie had always been the one taking care of me, while I had barely taken care of her at all.

Even during those difficult months when she was pregnant with Brian,I constantly used my "demanding Wall Street investment job" as an excuse to shirk my responsibilities as a husband and father. Yet Annie never complained. She always understood my pressure, never forcing me to share the burden of childcare.
A bitter smile crossed my face. As a wife, Annie was irreproachable; as a mother, Annie was devoted. The only person who had consistently failed was me.

I remembered when Annie was pregnant-I had just started making decent money on Wall Street. But fearing potential financial crises at the company, I was reluctant to spend money on Annie's maternity expenses.I even made her handle the hospital bills for Brian's birth herself.

How absurd that thinking seemed now! Annie was just a pregnant woman who had moved from Boston to New York for marriage-how was she supposed to earn money? These things I once took for granted now seemed unbelievably cruel.

I fumbled for my phone, my fingers trembling from alcohol and emotion. I dialed Annie's number from an unfamiliar line she wouldn't recognize.

"Hello?" My voice quavered, barely recognizable as my own.

On the other end. Annie's voice was slightly breathless, noticeably hurried:"What is it?"

I frowned. Her tone carried a hint of impatience, and she sounded as though she'd just been engaged in some physical activity.Without dwelling on this, I asked the question burning in my mind:

"When you gave birth to Brian back then, I didn't give you a single cent.Where did you get the money for your hospital stay?"
Each word felt like I was slowly tearing my own heart apart. A burning sensation clutched at my throat-was it the alcohol or my own guilt? I couldn't tell.
Annie was silent for a moment. During this pause, I thought I heard the faint rustling of fabric.
"I earned it myself," she finally answered, her voice jarringly calm.

My hand involuntarily tightened around the phone, knuckles turning white. "But after we got together, you spent every day taking care of me.You were heavily pregnant-where did you find time to work?"

As I spoke, tears streamed uncontrollably down my face. My chest felt as though someone had stomped on it, making it nearly impossible to breathe.

On the other end, Annie slightly adjusted her position; I heard the sound of sheets rustling. This detail made my heart clench, but I forced myself to focus on our conversation.

"Time?" Annie's voice remained steady, devoid of emotion. "If you're willing to squeeze it in. there's always time,isn't there?"

My mind flashed to recent reflections on my behavior. When I was wwith Sarah,she was accustomed to the lavish lifestyle of an Upper East Side socialite. Any piece of jewelry she casually purchased was worth more than all the money I had spent on Annie during our years together.

My stomach suddenly convulsed, nausea rising in my throat.

"Weren't you exhausted?" I asked, my voice nearly breaking.

"Of course I was. But thank goodness I persevered, otherwise I might not have had enough money for the hospital when giving birth."
Words failed me as I painfully realized that while other women could rely on their husbands duríng childbirth, I had been completely unreliable. I wiped my tears with the back of my hand, only to find they wouldn't stop flowing.
Just then, I heard a deep voice in the background-quiet,but clear enough for me to understand:′′I2ve got the water."


My heart began racing. It was Howard's voice. Why was Howard with Annie? And he sounded so...casual? Relaxed? Intimate?


Annie didn't respond to him, instead continuing to address me: "Actutally,there's something I've never been able to understand. When we first started dating, I was considerate of you, trying to help you save money.But somehow, by the end, it seemed like I just wasn't worthy anymore."

Her voice was calm and detached, as if describing something that had nothing to do with her. But I noticed her breathing seemed more steady now, no longer carrying that slight shortness from before.

"I'm sorry," I said, my voice shaking, my heart twisting in agony. The bottle in my hand slipped to the floor, the sound of shattering glass painfully loud in the quiet apartment.

"Don't you think it's too late to say these things now?" Annie asked casually. "Back when I needed money, when I needed someone to take care of me, you didn't treat me as your wife-you treated me as your enemy. Even when I was giving birth... you thought it was something I wanted for myself, that I should handle it on my own. You wouldn't help me at all."

I heard slight movement from the other end, Annie's breathing softly changing, followed by a brief silence. Something seemed hidden in that silence, making my heart beat faster as an ominous feeling spread through my chest.

"But now, it's all in the past. There's no need for either of us to keep living with bad memories," Annie continued, her voice carrying a barely perceptible distraction. "I've moved on. I hope you can move on too, and find a new life soon. It's best if you don't come around bothering me."

Just then, I heard the unmistakable sound of a mattress shifting slightly,followed by Howard's voice, closer now: "Put this shirt on, you'll catch cold.



This was no longer a whisper in the background-he was right beside Annie. My heart felt as if someone had seized it, making breathing difficult.

"Thank you." Annie's voice suddenly turned soft and sweet,completely different from the cold tone she had used with me.

Then I heard the soft sound of a kiss.

My stomach churned violently, bitter liquid rising in my throat. I understood everything-Annie and Howard had just been making love.Now they were probably lying in bed together, Howard thoughtfully taking care of her.

My trembling hand could barely hold the phone as all the blood in my body seemed to rush to my head, creating a buzzing in my ears.
"Sorry for the disturbance," I managed to choke out, my voice unrecognizably hoarse, then hung up.
I rushed to the bathroom, violently vomiting into the toilet. The mixture of bile and alcohol burned my throat, but the physical discomfort paled in comparison to the agony in my heart.
I collapsed onto the cold tiles, tears mixing with vomit. Why could other Wall Street executives treat their partners well, cherishing them after marriage, while I failed so completely?
I had given Annie neither love nor financial support-I had actively undermined her at every turn. And now, she had found a man who truly loved and respected her-Howard.

I leaned against the wall, utterly drained. I finally understood how much Annie must have loved me to accept my behavior without conditions. And I had destroyed that love with my own hands.

But now, for me, it was all too late.

Far too late.

###Chapter 202: Goodbye, Mark

Annie's POV

I stretched my arms above my head,feeling the satisfying pull in my muscles after hours of concentration.

My illustrations for the children's book were nearly complete-just a few more hours tomorrow and I'd be finished.

After that unexpected but wonderful morning with Howard, I'd managed to immerse myself completely in my work. The progress I'd made today was remarkable, perhaps fueled by the lingering contentment from our intimate moments together.

I tidied up my drawing materials, carefully arranging my brushes and closing my paint sets. The quiet of the house wrapped around me like a comfortable blanket. Lucy was away with her grandparents for the weekend, giving Howard and me this rare, peaceful time alone.
Just as I was about to head downstairs, my phone rang. I glanced at the screen and raised an eyebrow in surprise at the name displayed: Mark Burrows-my former editor at the publishing house. Why would he be calling me now, after all this time?
I answered casually,"Hello?"

While waiting for Mark to respond, I opened the group chat with my former colleagues and quickly typed:*"Mark Burrows is suddenly calling me. Does anyone know what's going on?"*
The responses came in rapid succession:

*"What else could it be?"*




-

*"Since he drove you out of the publishing house,he's managed to offend every other talented illustrator and pushed away the best editors."*

*"The only people left are yes-men. The publishing house is going downhill fast, almost bankrupt..."*

*"He's contacting illustrators he drove away one by one,trying to convince them to come back."*


I couldn't help but smile as I replied: *"Has anyone gone back?"*

The answers were unanimously negative:

*"Of course not!"*

*"Any freelance work out there is better than working under him. Why would anyone go back?"*

*"Only a fool would return to such a toxic environment."*

As my former colleagues continued their lively discussion, Mark finally spoke on the phone: "Annie, how have you been lately?"
His false cordiality almost made me laugh out loud. Then a thought occurred to me-why not let him talk and see what he actually wants?

"Getting by," I deliberately made my voice sound slightly weary,"Managing to survive."

Mark immediately asked with apparent concern, "Have you found a new job?"
"No," I lied, curious to see where he was going with this, "I've been looking since the divorce, but it hasn't been easy."

"Ah," his voice suddenly filled with artificial sympathy, "I figured as much.



I screenshotthis exchange and sent it to the group chat, immediately receiving replies:

*"The old fox is starting his performance!"*

*"I bet he's about to pretend to be kind and offer you an 'opportunity'."*

Mark continued, "I've been thinking about you. It must be difficult after the divorce, especially with a child..."

My mind drifted back to when I was pregnant with Brian. I had just moved to New York after marrying Philip, who rarely showed concern for my pregnancy, always claiming he was too busy with work.When I needed money for prenatal check-ups and was financially strapped, I had asked Mark to advance payment for illustrations I was about to complete.He not only refused but also reprimanded me.

"I remember when you were pregnant and asked me for an advance on your illustration fee," Mark's voice interrupted my memories, his tone carrying a hint of condescension, "The company's situation really didn't allow for it at the time."

"Yes," my voice was calm but with a touch of sarcasm, "So I had to figure out how to pay the hospital myself."

I shared this with the group chat too, immediately receiving a flurry of angry emojis and responses:
*"He has the nerve to bring that up!"*

*"You had already completed illustrations for three books, and he wouldn't

even give you a small advance!"*

Mark cleared his throat awkwardly, "That's all in the past. Annie, I'm actually calling today to tell you there's a position available at the publishing house. Considering our past working relationship, I wanted to ask if you might be interested in coming back?"

I almost laughed out loud. So that was his agenda.

"Oh?" I feigned surprise, "What kind of position?"

"Still doing children's book illustrations," Mark's tone became enthusiastic,"
Readers really like your style."

I continued to play along. "What about the compensation?"

"About that." his voice suddenly turned cautious,"Since you previously left us, your salary upon return might not match what it was before. We would calculate it based on when you first started with us."

A wave of anger surged through me, but I kept it in check. I shared his words with the group chat again, and my colleagues immediately erupted:

*"What the hell! He wants you to come back for an intern's salary?"*

*"Classic Mark move-push people out, then try to bring them back at a lower price!"*

*"Don't accept, Annie! This is blatant exploitation!"*

Reading these responses, I couldn't help but smile slightly. Mark continued his lecture:

"Annie, you need to understand that divorced women, especially those with children, have a hard time finding work. Me offering you this

opportunity is already an act of great kindness."

I could feel the condescension in his tone, as if he were bestowing charity.The attitude made my stomach turn.

"You know, the current job market isn't friendly to those who've left the workforce," he continued, "Even if you find work, it's usually the most basic positions with minimal pay. I'm willing to let you take charge of important projects right away, which, considering our history,is very special treatment."

I gave a noncommittal "Hmm," letting him continue.

"If you're smart, you'll seize this opportunity," Mark concluded with an air of someone who believed they'd closed a deal.

I shared this last part of our conversation with the group too, and immediately someone replied:

*"Reject him! Tell him how well you're doing now!"*

*"Let him know you're thriving without him!"*

I smiled, deciding it was time to end this farce.

"Mark, I have'a question," my voice suddenly became confident and relaxed,"What kind of company do you think Howard Technologies is?"

"Howard Technologies?" he sounded confused, "That's one of New York's top tech companies. Why are you suddenly asking about that?"

"Because I work there now," I said simply, enjoying the sudden silence on the other end.
"You... what?" Mark's voice rose by several octaves, "You work at Howard

Technologies?"

"Yes, I'm in charge of their children's education department," I answered calmly, "Tve been wworking there for some time now."

"Impossible!" Mark's voice was filled with disbelief, "Howard Technologies?Are you sure it's *that* Howard Technologies? Howard Thompson's company?"


I could almost picture his shocked expression, which gave me a sense of satisfaction.


"Yes,that Howard Technologies."

There was a long silence on the other end, and Icould hear Mark's rapid breathing.

"This... how is this possible?" his voice mixed surprise with a hint of jealousy,"Their hiring standards are extremely high..."

"Perhaps Howard Technologies thrives precisely because they don't impose arbitrary limitations in their hiring process like you do," I responded calmly,but each word carried a subtle edge.

Mark seemed to finally realize his position, and his tone became defensive:"Even if you're there now, so what? Large companies lay people off al the time,you could be fired soon. When that happens..."

"Even if Howard Technologies no longer needs me, I won't return to your publishing house," my stance was firm, "As you said, opportunities are always available for talented individuals."

"You-" Mark seemed about to say something harsh but ultimately controlled himself, his voice turning cold, "Suit yourself. Do you really

think the publishing house will collapse without your little illustrations?"

I knew his pride was hurt, but this reaction only confirmed I'd made the right choice.

"Well then, I wish your publishing house continued success. Goodbye,Mark." I said calmly before hanging up.

I shared the final exchange with the group, immediately receiving a stream of celebration emojis and "well done" responses. This small victory made me smile.


Life could indeed be so wonderfully different.

Then, there was a gentle knock at the studio door. I looked up to see Howard standing there, his tall frame outlined against the doorway.

"Dinner's ready," he said softly, "I made your favorite."

###Chapter 203: Like This?

Annie's POV

The Long Island mansion felt unusually quiet after dinner. I nestled in the corner of the living room sofa, casually flipping through a design magazine,occasionally glancing up at Howard sitting across from me,completely absorbed in his company documents. A peculiar tranquility surrounded us-no Lucy's crisp laughter, no sound of her bouncing footsteps. This silence was both strange and familiar, reminiscent of those first few days after I moved in.


My phone's vibration interrupted my thoughts. Putting down the magazine,I saw a message from Eleanor. Opening our family group chat, I found Eleanor's brief update: "We've arrived safely."

Immediately after, a series of photos flooded the screen. I couldn't help but smile. In the first picture, mischievous Penny stood on a massive rock striking an exaggerated pose, her small body curved into a C-shape,golden curls flying in the sea breeze, looking like a little queen who had just conquered the world.


Meanwhile, our Lucy stood beside her, expression slightly reserved,hands properly folded in front of her, with just a hint of a smile at the corners of her mouth.

So very Thompson, I thought to myself.

As I continued scrolling, the second photo caught me by surprise. Taken at dusk on the beach, Lucy looked like a completely different person-she and Penny were running hand in hand in the shallow water,blonde hair wet against her cheeks, her smile so wide it nearly reached her ears. What astonished me most was the sparkle in her eyes, that pure, childlike joy, an

expression I had never seen on her face before.

Without realizing it, I found myself staring at that photo, lost in thought.

"What's got you so captivated?" Howard's voice drifted from the other end of the sofa.


I looked up with a smile. "Look at Lucy, see how happy she is."

Howard set down his tablet and moved closer to me. I handed him my phone, my finger tapping the screen. "Look howbrightly she's smiling. I've never seen her like this before."

Howard's brow relaxed slightly, his gaze softening. "The Parkers understand children better than I expected."

I turned back to the group chat and quickly replied: "Playing so happily already? Lucy looks like a different person."

Eleanor didn't keep us waiting long: "Lucy was shy at first, but Penny quickly pulled her out of her shell. By the time we reached the beach, she had completely opened up. The little ones are exhausted now,they fell asleep right after their bath. Don't worry, I've made sure their hair is dry."

I was about to respond when a private message from Sue appeared: "This is the first time Penny's been away from me for so long since I got her back from Dave. Seeing her having such a great time gives me mixed feelings. You know what I mean?"

I sighed softly and replied: "Perhaps we should learn to let go a little from now on."

Sue responded quickly: "You're right. Parents who always try to keep their children close end up raising dependent adults."

I shook my head with a smile and put down my phone, only to realize Howard had moved very close, almost touching my shoulder. His presence subtly enveloped me, carrying the faint scent of cologne and whiskey.

"It's getting late," I glanced at the wall clock, which showed past ten, "I should get some sleep."


With that, I stood up and walked toward the stairs. Behind me came the sound of Howard rising, then his footsteps following mine. I didn't look back.but I could feel him not far behind me, like a quiet shaddow.

Upstairs, around the corridor, nearly at my bedroom door, I finally turned around: "It's just these few steps, is it really necessary to follow me the whole way?"

When I turned, I found him gazing at me, his eyes filled with honest desire and a touch of almost childlike stubbornness.

"Absolutely necessary," he said, his voice deep and resolute.

In that moment, I suddenly found this usually mature man somewhat adorable. He stood there, hands in his pockets, like a little boy waiting for praise.


"This is far enough," I teased, "Mr. Thompson."

Howard didn't shy away from my playful tone. Instead,he stepped closer:"Being able to spend even one more second with you is precious to me."

His words were like a small pebble gently tossed into the calm lake of my heart,creating ripples.

We stood there, looking at each other. A certain understanding spread between us.

"Perhaps," I pushed open the bedroom door, my voice softer than I'd intended, "you'd like to come in and look at more photos of Lucy?"

Howard's eyes lit up, but he quickly resumed his gentlemanly restraint."If you don't mind."


He followed me into the bedroom, quietly closing the door behind him.I sat on the edge of the bed, opening my phone again, scrolling to the photo that had surprised me most: "Look how happy she is, like a completely different person."

Howard sat down beside me, his body slightly leaning toward mine.Strangely, though his gaze was on the phone screen, I could feel his attention wasn't there. His breathing was slightly uneven, his eyes occasionally drifting toward me before forcing themselves back to the screen.


"Are you even looking at the photos?" I couldn't help asking.

Howard paused, as if caught in the act. "Hmm? Of course..."

"Then what did you just see?"

"Lucy... she looks very happy," he tried to answer seriously,but his expression was clearly guilty.

I couldn't help laughing. "I didn't say anything specific, just asked if you were looking at the photos."

Howard Thompson, who commanded respect in the corporate world, now resembled a student caught daydreaming, pressing his lips together in slight embarrassment. This sight stirred an unusual feeling in me-this man who usually maintained perfect control over everything was showing such an unguarded side to me.

"Sorry," he admitted honestly, his voice low, "I wasn't looking at the photos."

"Then what were you looking at?" I asked,knowing full well the answer.

Howard looked at me, his gaze so intense it could almost burn: "You know what I was looking at."

"Tell me," I insisted softly.

Howard's gaze was direct and fervent: "At you. Always at you."

We stared at each other for a moment, the temperature in the room seemingly rising suddenly.

Before I could respond, Howard leaned forward, pressing his lips against mine.


I instinctively responded, my fingers running through his black hair.Howard's arms encircled my waist, pulling me toward him. In one fluid motion, he stood up, lifting me along with him. My legs naturally wrapped around his waist, surprised by his strength and decisiveness.

"Howard!" I exclaimed, though not in protest.

He didn't respond, just carríed mne a few steps to the wall, then gently pressed me against it. The coldness of the wall penetrated my thin nightgown, creating a contrast with Howard's burning heat that sent a shiver through my entire body.

"Cold?" Howard whispered in my ear, his voice deep and husky.

I shook my head, pulling him closer. "Not with you here."

Howard's hands supported my hips, holding me firmly against the wall.

His lips moved from my mouth to my neck, trailing downward,gently biting my collarbone. I tilted my head back, resting it against the wall,a soft moan escaping from deep in my throat.

I quickly unbuttoned his shirt, eager to feel his skin. Howard's chest was broad and firm, muscles tensing slightly beneath my fingers. He helped me remove my nightgown, and now the cold wall directly contacted my back,sending another shiver through me.


Howard still supported me with one hand while the other began exploring every sensitive spot on my body. His movements were both powerful and precise, knowing exactly how to elicit my strongest reactions. When his fingers slid between my legs, I instinctively arched my back,meeting his touch.


"You're ready," Howard whispered against my ear, his voice filled with desire.


"Don't make me wait," I commanded, my hands already unbuckling his belt.


Howard quickly adjusted his position, pressing me against the wall.I could feel his hot hardness at my entrance. He looked into my eyes as he slowly pushed forward. I drew a sharp breath, my legs tightly wrapped around his waist, fingers digging into his shoulders.

"Annie..." he called my name, his voice filled with longing and possessiveness.


Our bodies joined intimately, and Howard began to move rhythmically.Each thrust gently pushed my back against the wall, but the pain and pleasure intermingled, creating an extraordinary sensation. The coldness of the wall against the heat of his body created a conflict within me,making

each contact more intense.

His pace gradually quickened, and I wrapped my arms tightly around his neck, breathing raggedly against his ear. Howard's breathing also became heavier, the muscles in his arms tensing as he held me securely in the small space between him and the wall.

As the waves of climax approached, I bit into his shoulder, initially intending to suppress my cries. The household staff had gone home,and no one else was around. I no longer held back my voice, letting it free.

My sounds ignited something in Howard. I felt his thrusts becoming more powerful with each movement.

"Look at me," he commanded, his voice deep and firm.

I raised my head, meeting his eyes directly. In that moment, ecstasy completely overtook me, my body trembling uncontrollably. Howard reached his peak simultaneously, resting his forehead in the crook of my neck,releasing a satisfied growl.

"I've been wanting to tell you," Howard whspered in my ear, "when Lucy isn't home, we can do many things that aren't convenient otherwise."

I couldn't help but smile. "Like this?"

Howard smiled, kissing my forehead. "Yes, like this."

###Chapter 204: Are You Threatening Me?

Philip's POV

Damn this headache! I struggled to consciousness through a foggy haze,each heartbeat like someone pounding a drum against my temples. The bitter aftertaste of alcohol lingered in my mouth, my throat as dry as if it had been coated with salt. I kept my eyes tightly shut, trying to block out the harsh sunlight piercing through the blinds.

Without opening my eyes, I instinctively called out to the empty room,"Annie, why didn't you make me your hangover soup last night?" My voice was frighteningly hoarse, like sandpaper scraping against metal.

I rolled over on the sofa, my wrinkled shirt sticking uncomfortably to my back as a wave of nausea washed over me. "My head is killing me.Could you massage my temples a little?"


Only cold silence answered me. No footsteps, no sighs, no familiar scent of lilac that always surrounded Annie.

Reality suddenly hit me like a bucket of ice water poured over my head.My eyes snapped open, and the living room spun before me. Empty bottles lay scattered across the floor, reflecting the harsh light. Annie wasn't here. She had left me. She had chosen Howard Thompson, and all I had left was this mess and endless regret.

I gripped the sofa and tried to stand, but my legs felt as limp as overcooked pasta. I staggered a couple of steps, nearly tripping over the coffee table. The clock on the wall showed it was already ten in the morning.

Unlike me, Howard Thompson would never appear before Annie

exhausted and hungover. Howard would never yell at her without reason or blame her for his own mistakes.


The thought filled me with deep self-loathing. I had always blamed Annie for my self-destructive behavior, accused her of not being attentive enough,not caring enough, when in fact, her kindness toward me had extended far beyond what anyone deserved.


I collapsed back onto the sofa,feeling my ribs protest. I closed my eyes,and Annie's face immediately appeared before me, so clearit was as if she were right in front of me.

Memories came flooding back like a tidal wave: how she would wordlessly help me to bed when I returned home drunk in the middle of the night;how her small but strong hands would precisely adjust the water temperature to make the perfect hangover soup; how her gentle fingers would draw circles on my temples to drive away my migraines; how she always prepared my breakfast in advance, even when she hadn't slept all night taking care of Brian.

"Why?" I whispered to the empty room, "Why did I take her for granted when I had her, only to discover she was the most precious thing in my life after I lost her?"


My voice echoed in this cold apartment, with no one to answer except the lifeless,expensive furniture.

The harsh ring of the telephone cut through my thoughts like a sharp sword. The vibrating phone jumped on the glass coffee table, making a sound more grating than usual. I looked at the name flashing on the screen: Sarah Johnson.

I took a deep breath, suppressing my internal resistance, and answered."

Hello?"

Sarah's voice came through the phone, carrying obvious concern: "Philip,dear,you sound terrible. About what we discussed last night... do you remember?"


I rubbed my temples, struggling to recall our conversation through the fog of alcohol. Vague fragments, like pieces of a broken puzzle,slowly connected in my mind. Yes, she had mentioned something about stabilizing our relationship, and... a child. I closed my eyes and squeezed a few words through clenched teeth: "Yes, I remember."

Her tone became soft and intimate: "Darling, I know you're not feeling well right now, but we really need to talk about our future."

She continued: "I'm worried about our baby. I want him to grow up in a safe, stable family. You know, I've been through a failed marriage, and I don't want history to repeat itself."

She paused, then went on: "I just want to make sure our relationship is solid, that our child will receive all your love and attention. Not like Brian..



Brian's name pierced my chest like a sharp knife. My gaze fell on the dusty family pòrtrait on the bookshelf-me, Annie, and Brian, still a baby at the time. Thinking about it now, I could barely remember my son's face.Time had slipped through my fingers like sand, and I hadn't even realized what I'd lost.


When I didn't respond, Sarah raised her voice slightly:"Philip,are you listening?"

"I'm listening," I answered softly, my chest compressed by a heavy feeling.

Sarah continued: "I know you still have feelings for Annie. I can understand that, really." There was a hint of jealousy in her voice. "But now that we're going to have our own child, I hope you can make some commitments, to prove to me that this time will be different."

"What kind of commitments?" I asked, somewhat confused. In the past,I might have immediately agreed to any of her demands, but now I felt an instinctive hesitation.

Sarah's voice turned syrupy sweet: "I want a guarantee that you'll be one hundred percent committed to our family." She took a deep breath. "I've thought of a way... if you had a vasectomy, it would give me peace of mind."


"What?" My voice rose an octave, the shock instantly replacing my hangover headache. I jumped up from the sofa, nearly dropping the glass in my hand. "That's absurd!"

"Please hear me out," Sarah quicklysaid,her voice filled with what seemed like genuine pleading, "You already have Brian, and soon you'll have our baby. I just want to make sure you won't be distracted in the future,that you won't leave us for other women and other children."

She mentioned Brian, which triggered my guilt: "Look at Brian's situation now. I don't want our child to go through the same thing. Think about it,how heartbroken would our baby be if you abandoned him too?"

I felt a wave of discomfort; this demand was too much. "Sarah, this is an unreasonable request. I don't think it's necessary."

"Philip," Sarah's voice became somewhat tense,though she still tried to maintain patience, "I know this sounds extreme, but please understand my concerns."

"I understand your concerns, but a vasectomy? That's not the way to solve the problem," I insisted.


Sarah was silent for a few seconds. When she spoke again, her tone had completely changed: "I thought you would do anything for our child." Her voice cooled. "I've given you a chance, Philip. You've seen the consequences of making the wrong life choices. If you can't prove your commitment to me, then I have no reason to continue this pregnancy."

"Are you threatening me?" I asked in surprise.

"No, I'm just stating facts," Sarah's tone was resolute. "If you can't do this,I'll terminate the pregnancy. Rather than bringing a child into this world who constantly worries about being abandoned by his father,it's better not to have this child at all."

Her words sank like a stone in water,but the ripples they created were unexpected-instead of the panic and anger I anticipated, I felt a strange sense of relief. It was as if someone had opened a window,letting fresh air rush into a room that had been sealed for too long.

My voice carried a firmness that surprised even me: "You should think carefully,Sarah." I paced slowly, my voice growing stronger. "Once you terminate this pregnancy, I won't give you a penny, ever, regardless of whether you need money in the future."

"As for having children..." I said coolly, "If I want children,there are many women willing to help me."

"Consider carefully whether you really want to give up this child." My voice carried a caImness I hadn't anticipated. "I need to consider whether I really want to have children with someone else."

There was silence on the other end, with only faint breathing indicating Sarah was still on the line. This might have been the first time I'd had the upper hand in our verbal exchanges, and I didn't even need to deliberately strive for it.

"Philip," she finally spoke, her voice carrying a hint of surprise I'd never heard before, "You can't treat me-treat our child-this way. This isn't like you at all."


She tried to regain her usual tone: "I've made up my mind. If you don't agree to my conditions. I'll schedule the procedure immediately."

"The money I transferred to you last tíme should be enough for the procedure," my tone could only be described as indifferent. "If you don't mind, you can schedule the surgery for tomorrow morning."


###Chapter 205: I Can't Let History Repeat Itse

Sarah's POV

"The money I transferred to you last time should be enough for the procedure. If you don't mind, you can schedule the surgery for tomorrow morning."

The moment the call ended, it felt as if a block of ice had dropped from the top of my head. slowly sliding down my spine to the soles of my feet.I sat there, phone still pressed against my ear, my brain seemingly having stopped functioning.

I gently set down my phone, my gaze falling on the expensive abstract painting on the opposite wall-the one Philip had bought for me without hesitation during one of our dates. Where had that infatuation and adoration in his eyes gone? How had the man who was like a well-trained hunting dog, always ready to please me,suddenly grown fangs?

"Bastard!" I cursed, standing up to pace back and forth across the room.Just minutes ago, I had confidently made that request-for him to have a vasectomy. In my plan, he should have yielded as usual, and then I would have permanently secured his future.

I stopped in my tracks, my hand unconsciously moving to my abdomen.No, I couldn't panic. This child was mny biggest bargaining chip. Did Philip really think I would go through with an abortion? He was so naive.

Taking a deep breath, I sat back down on the sofa, considering my next move. Betty's face flashed through my mind-that self-important Upper East Side socialite, always meddling in her son's love life. Perhaps... she could help.

I picked up my phone and dialed Betty's number. The moment the call connected. I imnmediately adjusted my expression, knowing that even though she couldn't see me. I could feel my voice changing to sound more pitiful: "Mom. I don't know if it's because of the pregnancy, but my emotions have been extremely unstable lately."

The deliberate sob in my voice almost made me believeit myself.

"What's wrong, dear?" Betty's voice immnediately filled with concern, just as I had anticipated. This woman always loved playing the savior role.

I took a deep breath and began my performance: "Philip keeps getting closer to Annie." My voice started to tremble, tears ready to fall at any moment. "When I see them together, I can't help but think... what if they reconciled? What would happen to me and the baby? What should I do?"

I heard her gasp on the other end of the line. Success-she took the bait.

"That's impossible!" Betty immediately responded firmly, her voice filled with certainty, "As long as I'm around, those two will never get back together!"

On my end of the phone, I gently bit my lower lip, suppressing the smile that was about to emerge. Betty's reaction was exactly as I had expected.

"You know," Betty contínued, her voice suddenly turning sharp, "that Annie Baker was never good enough for my son. Just an ordinary girl from Boston, no family background, only that pitiful illustration talent.Marrying Philip was marrying up for her."

I deliberately sighed: "But Philip seems like he still can't let her go..."

"Ridiculous!" Betty was practically shouting, "Women like Annie Baker simply don't understand how to maintain a marriage. She's too self-

centered,doesn't know how to care for a man's needs and feelings.I knew from the beginning she wasn't suitable for our family."

Listening to Betty's disparagement of Annie, a wave of satisfaction surged within me. Annie's gentle and virtuous demeanor always made me sick,and now having someone who hated her as much as I did felt wonderful.

"Sometimes I worry," I deliberately let my voice take on a hint of vulnerability, "that there might still be feelings between them..."

"Don't be silly, dear." Betty's tone suddenly became gentle, as if coaxing a child, "Annie is just latching onto Howard Thompson now, trying to use him to get back at my son. She's always been that type of opportunistic woman."


I softly agreed: "She did get together with Howard very quickly after the divorce..."


"Isn't it obvious?" Betty gave a cold laugh, "Without a man, she's nothing.She married Philip right after college, then immediately attached hersef to Howard after the divorce. All that talk about independence and career ambition is just a facade she puts on for others."

Hearing Betty repeat the same views as mine, I felt a strange sense of validation. Even though I knew she was merely being manipulated into saying these things, at this moment we were indeed on the same side.

"But just verbal reassurance makes me feel so insecure..." I paused, as if holding back tears.

"What would you like me to do?" Betty asked, her tone filled with the eagerness to appease me.

The moment had come. I held my breath and directly threw out my

request: "Have Philip get a vasectomy."

Suddenly, there was silence on the other end. I could imagine the shocked expression on Betty's face, that elegant mask crumbling in an instant.Just thinking about it made me want to laugh out loud.

"Isn't it usually women who get sterilization procedures?" Betty finally spoke, her voice obviously raised a few pitches, "I don't think men typically get vasectomies..."

Her hesitation was exactly what I had expected. After all, this request essentially meant cutting off Philip's future reproductive possibilities.But I needed to persist.

"Only when Philip can no longer have more children," my voice suddenly became unusually firm, tears now withdrawn, "can I believe he won't easily abandon my child."

Betty fell silent on the other end. This silence spoke more than any response-my request had clearly exceeded her expectations. The light sound of breathing came through the receiver, and those seconds of pause seemed particularly long at this moment. I gripped the phone tightly,enjoying this rare feeling of being in control, in no hurryto break the silence.


"Sarah," Betty finally spoke, "dear, I understand your concerns. But,you know, a vasectomy is permanent. Philip is the only heir to the Baker family, the future of the family business..."

I interrupted her: "Isn't the child in my womb an heir to the Baker family?

11


Another silence. I knew I had hit Betty's weak spot-since Brian had left

with Annie.she had been upset about losing her grandson. Now the child in my womb,regardless of who the real father was, represented the hope for the continuation of the Baker family line to her.

"Of course," Betty's voice noticeably softened, "the baby in your womb is certainly the future of our family. It's just..."

"Just what?" I pressed my advantage, "Are you concerned that Philip might have children with other women, then neglect my child? Just like what he's doing to Brian now?"

A clear gasp came from the other end of the phone. I knew my words had hit the mark-Brian's situlation had always been a sore point for Betty.She had complained multiple timnes about Philip's cold attitude toward Brian, saying it would ruin the Baker family's reputation in social circles.

"Sarah, dear," Betty's voice suddenly became unusually resolute,"you're right. I can't let history repeat itself."

I could almost feel the transformation in her tone. This was no longer the indecisive Upper East Side socialite, but a strong woman determined to protect her family's interests.

"I will not let Philip make the same mistake again," she continued, her voice carrying à rare iron will, "The first time was my oversight, allowing him to treat Brian and Annie that way. But this time, this child will receive all the love and support of the Baker family."

I gripped the phone tightly, surprised at how quickly the situation had turned.

"I'll handle Philip," Betty said, the determination in her tone taking me by surprise,"As for that surgery, if it gives you peace of mind,then it must be

done. The Baker family heir cannot have any uncertainties."

"Really?" I asked cautiously, hardly believing my ears.

"Of course," Betty's voice carried a decisiveness I had never heard before,"This isn't just about your future and the child's future, but also about the future of the entire Baker family. Philip must understand where his responsibilities lie. Don't worry, I'll make him agree."

She paused, then added in an aImost threatening tone: "If he doesn't agree,
Ill make him understand the cost of defiance."

I could hardly believe the transformation had come so suddenly and completely. Although I had anticipated Betty would support me, I hadn't expected her to be so determined, even willing to threaten Philip with the family fortune.

"Alright," I took a deep breath, my tone suddenly becoming cold. "Tell him that if he doesn't have the surgery, I will terminate this pregnancy."

After saying this, I immediately hung up, afraid Betty might detect the uncertainty in my voice. I collapsed onto the sofa, my hand pressed firmly against my abdomen, feeling as if the baby was responding to me.

A smile involuntarily crept onto my lips. The developments were even smoother than I had anticipated-not only had I gained Betty's support,but I had also unexpectedly received her full assistance.

###Chapter 206: This Is All Your Fault

Philip's POV

"The money I transferred to you last time should be enough for the procedure. If you don't mind, you can schedule the surgery for tomorrow morning." I coldly delivered these words before hanging up on Sarah.

I tossed my phone onto the sofa and leaned back against the cold leather.My head was throbbing mercilessly, each heartbeat sending waves of pain throughout my body. I needed a hot shower, something to wash away the hangover and anger.

As soon as I stood up, my knees felt as heavy as if they'd been filled with lead. I had to brace myself against the wall to maintain balance. In the bathroom mirror, I stared at a stranger-haggard, bloodshot eyes,disheveled hair, stubbled chin-I barely recognized myself.

Is this what had become of Philip Baker, the once-brilliant Wall Street executive? I laughed bitterly and turned on the shower. The hot water cascaded over may skin but did nothing to wash away the bitterness in my heart.


Just as the hot water began to ease my tense muscles, my phone rang, the sound penetrating through the bathroom door. I closed my eyes, trying to ignore it, but the persistent ringing continued, as if mocking my attempts to escape reality.

"Damn it!" I cursed,turning off the faucet and grabbing a towel to wrap around my waist before stumbling back toward the bedroom.

My mother's name flashed on the screen. I took a deep breath and answered.

"Philip." My mother's voice came through the receiver, steady and powerful as always.

"Mom, what is it?" I tried to keep my voice calm, but the hangover made me sound harsher than intended.


"I've been trying to reach you several times, but you weren't answering."Her words carried a hint of reproach, yet also concealed concern.


Water dripped from my hair down my spine, making me shiver involuntarily. "Sorry, I was in the shower."

After a brief silence on the other end, my mother's voice softened: "Are you alright? You don't sound like yourself."

"I'm fine, just a bit of a headache." I rubbed my temples as water droplets slid between my fingers.

"How much have you been drinking?" she asked bluntly, the knowing tone in her voice irritating me.

"Not much," I lied, my gaze sweeping over the empty bottles on the nightstand. "Just didn't sleep well."

My mother sighed softly. "Philip, I'm worried about you. Since the divorce,you've been on a path of self-destruction. It's not good for your health."

"Thanks for your concern," I responded dryly. "Is there anything else?"

The silence on the other end was longer than usual, putting me on alert.My mother rarely hesitated, and this unusual behavior signaled something important.

"Philip." My mother's voice was like a sharp scalpel, easily cutting through

my nerves even across the phone line.

"Mom, what is it?" I mumbled, my voice so hoarse it was barely recognizable. My throat burned as if the whiskey I'd consumed last night was still aflame.


"How are you feeling?" she asked, with that pretend-concern tone I knew too well. Ever since childhood, whenever she used this tone, there was always some hidden agenda.

"Fantastic." I laughed bitterly, glancing at the empty bottles scattered across the floor, each a testament to my failed attempts to drown memories of Annie.


"I know you've been thinking about Annie lately," she carefully mentioned the name, as if handling an explosive. "But you need to take care of your health-after all, your body is your most valuable asset."

I sat up abruptly, immediately hit by dizziness, and had to grip the sofa arm to maintain balance. "Cut the crap," I snapped. "Just tell me what you want."


Silence fell for a moment on the other end. "Philip," she finally spoke, her voice carrying an unusual hesitation, "are you still planning to reconcile with Annie?"


Annie's name struck my heart like a dagger. I closed my eyes, and her face immediately appeared-the fine lines at the corners of her eyes when she smiled,her tightly pressed lips when she concentrated on work,her slightly wrinkled nose when angry. These memories washed over me like a tide,nearly drowning me.

"Yes!" I practically roared. "I will win her back, no matter how long it

takes!"

"So you're not considering other women anymore?" My mother's voice rose a few decibels, clearly displeased with my answer.

I slammed my fist on the coffee table, the pain slightly clearing my head."No.Never."


"So you also don't plan to have children with other women?" She pressed on, her controlling nature evident in every word.

Under the influence of alcohol, my emotions were like a wild horse,impossible to rein in. "Enough already!" I shouted, my voice echoing through the empty apartment. "I love Annie! Only Annie! I won't be with any other woman! Can you just drop it?"

An unsettling silence fell on the other end, with only my mother's faint breathing proving she was still on the line. When she spoke again,her voicewas unnervingly calm, more frightening than any shout.

"Then you should take Sarah's advice and get a vasectomy."

Those words hit me like a bucket of ice water,instantly sobering me up. I jumped to my feet, nearly tripping over the empty bottles on the floor."What insanity are you talking about?"

My mother seemed to have anticipated my reaction. "Sarah told me that if you don't have this surgery, she'll terminate the pregnancy."

My brain felt like it had been hit by a bomb, completely blank. "Wait, wait,"I stammered, struggling to concentrate. "Are you telling me that Sarah is demanding I get a vasectomy, or else she'll have an abortion? And you,my own mother, are actually taking her side?"

I burst into laughter, sharp and grating, foreign even to my own ears."This is absurd! What exactly do you think I am?"


"Philip, calm down." My mother's voice attempted to soothe me, but only made me angrier.

"Calm down?" I paced in the small space, my chest burning with anger."You two are conspiring to have me undergo permanent sterilization,and you're telling me to calm dowvn?"

"Sarah contacted you, didn't she?" I suddenly stopped.

The silence on the other end was answer enough.

"I can't believe this!" I roared.

"T've always been on your side!" My mother finally raised her voice. "Look at yourself! Drunk, suffering over a woman who's already left you! If I wasn't trying to help you, why would I support Sarah?"

"Help me? Ha! When have you ever truly thought about what's best for me?" I rubbed my temples, the hangover headache and emotional turmoil making it nearly impossible to think. "You only care about yourself, about the Baker family reputation and heir!"

"DonI't say that!" There was hurt in my mother's voice, but I was beyond caring about her feelings.

"What did you say when Annie was pregnant with Brian?" I continued venting my anger. "You said she wasn't good enough for me,that her pregnancy was a trap to tie me down! And now, you're siding with Sarah,a woman who's blackmailing me into having sterilization surgery!"

My chest heaved violently, as if a wild beast was trying to break free. "Tell

me. Mom,why does Sarah get your support? Is it because of her family background? Or because she knows how to please you better?"

"Philip, you don't understand..." My mother tried to explain, but I'd had enough excuses.

"No, *you* don't understand!" I interrupted, my voice shaking with anger. "This is my body, my life! No one, including you and Sarah, has the right to decide whether I should have this surgery!"

"Annie won't come back to you," she finally said, her voice ice-cold."She has Howard Thompson now. You're just wasting your time."

My throat tightened, a sharp pain shooting through me. Howard Thompson's name was like a dull knife, cutting into my heart over and over. I knew Annie was with him now, and this fact tortured me every day.

"Even if Annie never comes back," I clenched my teeth, "I still won't give in. Tell Sarah I'd rather have nothing than surrender to her threats."

"Philip, think about it again," my mother's voice suddenly softened,carrying a hint of pleading. "The child in Sarah's womb is our family's hope. If she really terminates the pregnancy, you'll only have Brian left.And you know your relationship with Brian is already..."

"And you've seen how strained my relationship with Brian has become."She continued, her voice laced with obvious accusation. "Can you really bear to see me grow old alone? To watch others surrounded by grandchildren while I only have one grandson who wants nothing to do with me?"

I laughed coldly: "Yes, I can." For the first time in years, I felt a strange sense of liberation, as if breaking free from invisible shackles that had

bound me.

"You ungrateful bastard!" My mother finally lost her carefully maintained elegant composure,her voice distorted with anger. "Have you forgotten who raised you? Who got you into the best universities? Who gave you everything?"


"It was you, Mom," I admitted, my voice surprisingly calm. "But everything you gave came with conditions. Every bit of 'love' was another form of control over me. Not this time."

"You-" she could barely speak. "You must listen to me! If it weren't for me,you would be nothing right now!"

I closed my eyes, feeling a wave of exhaustion wash over me. "Enough,Mom. My answer is no. Never. You can relay that message to Sarah."

"You're forcing my hand!" My mother's voice suddenly turned shrill, with a hysterical edge. "If you don't agree, I'll kill myself right now! Did you hear me? I'll die! And it will all be your fault!"

###Chapter 207: Is It Done?

Philip's POV

"If you don't agee. I'll kill myself right now!"

My mother's shrill voice pierced through my eardrums. I stood frozen in place, droplets of water from the shower sliding down my cheeks,the cold sensation creating a stark contrast with the throbbing pain at my temples.The hangover made my entire skull feel like it had been stuffed into a blender,buzzing incessantly.

"Mom, are you serious?" My mouth tasted bitter, my tongue feeling like it was wrapped in sandpaper.

"Of course!" Her voice cut through my headache. "Don't think I'm joking.Philip!"

I grabbed a towel and haphazardly wiped my face. A vasectomy? God,what kind of game were Sarah and my mother playing? I leaned against the sink, staring at my reflection in the mirror-puffy eye bags, pale lips,bloodshot eyes. I barely recognized the man looking back at me.

My phone rang again, the screen lighting up with a video call request.

My finger slid across to answer, and the image on the screen made me gasp. My mother was standing at the edge of a high-rise building, her Burberry trench coat flapping violently in the wind, her gray hair disheveled by the strong gusts. She had actually gone up to the rooftop.

"Do you believe me now?" Her voice was unnervingly calm, but her eyes were sharp as an eagle's.

"Mom, stop this nonsense and come down!" My voice cracked with panic.

"Nonsense?" She let out a cold laugh. "For thirty years I've given everything to this family, and now when I ask you to do just one thing.you call it nonsense?"

She rotated the phone. directing the camera downward. The scene on the street below came into clear view-a group of people had formed a semicircle, looking up and pointing. A coffee delivery boy stood with his mouth agape; a couple clutched each other's hands tightly, the girl's face drained of color; several men in business suits had stopped to stare;an elderly woman with silver hair was shakily dialing on her phone.Some people had taken out their phones to film, their flashes glinting in the sunlight.

I heard my mother shouting: "My son is so heartless! He'd rather watch me jump than fulfill a mother's small wish!"

Gasps erupted from the crowd. "Oh my God!" "Someone's going to jump!""Call the police!" "What kind of monster treats his mother like that?"

My heart raced, my chest tightening. This wasn't some damn TV drama-this was my real life. If she jumped-

A wave of dizziness hit me, and I steadied myself against the wall. In my mind flashed Annie's disappointed gaze, Brian's distant back. What was I supposed to do? Having this surgery meant I would never have children again, but if I refused, and my mother actually jumped... that would be a nightmare I could never escape.

"Fine, I'll do it," my voice was so dry it didn't sound like my own. "But you have to promise me that once the surgery is done, this is over."

A glint of triumph flashed in my mother's eyes."We'll stay on video call the whole time. I want to see you walk into the hospital, watch the doctor

complete the surgery."

I hastily threw on a shirt and trousers, not even taking the time to tie my shoelaces. Off-camera, my hands were trembling, whether from the hangover or from anger, I couldn't tell. Perhaps both.

I rushed out of my apartment building, the blinding sunlight hitting my face like a slap. I stumbled into my car, my hands barely cooperating as I started the engine. The phone was mounted on the dashboard, my mother's face filling the entire screen.

"Hurry up. Philip!" she urged, her voice echoing inside the car.

The glass doors of the private hospital slid open before me,a blast of cold air hitting my face, carrying the scent of disinfectant. The receptionist looked up, recognizing me.

"Mr. Baker?" She offered a professional smile. "Do you have an appointment today?"

I looked directly into her eyes, making sure my voice was clear enough for the phone to pick up: "I need a vasectomy. Now."

Her smile froze momentarily, her gaze quickly darting to my mother's face on the phone screen, then back to me. "Please wait, I'll call the doctor."

The few minutes of waiting felt like centuries. I paced in the waiting room,my throat burning with thirst, my headache intensifying. The decorative paintings on the wall seemed to distort before my eyes, their vivid colors seemingly mocking my situation.

The doctor entered in his white coat, handing me a stack of forms. His voice was flat, as if discussing the weather: "Mr. Baker, while vasectomy is theoretically reversible, the success rate isn't high, and it should be

considered a procedure with long-term effects on fertility. We usually recommend that patients communicate thoroughly with their partners and carefully consider before deciding..."

"No need to consider." I roughly interrupted him, grabbing the pen. The tip nearly tore through the paper. "Let's get started."

Lying on the cold operating table, as the anesthesiologist prepared the injection. I felt a strange sense of release. It was as if this surgery wasn't just cutting off my reproductive ability, but also severing some long-standing constraint.

"Count to ten. Mr. Baker," the anesthesiologist's voice gradually faded.

"One...two...three..."

I didn't make it to four before darkness swallowed my consciousness.

When I woke up, a dull pain radiated from my lower body. My vision focused on a crack in the ceíling, shaped like a question mark. My phone was still on, my mother's face on the screen. She had returned to her warm,comfortable living room, crystal chandelier twinkling above her head.

"Is it done?" she asked, unable to hide the smugness in her voice.

"Yes," my throat felt like it had been scorched.

"That's the only right decision you've made, Philip," she adjusted her necklace. "You've finally done something decent. This is the best protection for the Baker family."

I stared at her meticulously made-up face, suddenly feeling as if I was looking at a stranger. Was this really the woman who had raised me?
"From today onward," I said, each word deliberate, "I am no longer your son."


Her smile froze on her face. "What nonsense are you talking about?"

I didn't respond, instead pressing the disconnect button and immediately blocking her number. The entire process was surprisingly calm, like discarding a worn-out piece of clothing.

Back at my apartment, I collapsed onto the sofa, feeling as if all the strength had been drained from my body. A hollowness spread from my chest to every extremity. I dialed my secretary's number, my voice hoarse but determined.


"Starting today, stop all payments to Betty Baker. All accounts, all credit cards."


A moment of silence from the other end of the line: "Sir, are you... are you sure?"


"Absolutely certain. If she wants money,tell her to find a lawyer. I will only pay the minimum amount legally required."

After hanging up, I lay motionless, staring at the ceiling. Last night's empty bottles lay scattered across the floor.

I wanted to laugh, but found my eyes growing damp instead.

My gaze inadvertently fell on a photograph on the bookshelf-me, Annie,and newborn Brian. Back then, I was smiling so confidently, as if I had the whole world in my grasp. How ironic.

"I'm sorry," I whispered to the photograph, not sure who I was apologizing to.


###Chapter 208: You Can't Do This!

Sarah's POV

The shrill ring of my phone interrupted my afternoon rest. Betty's name flashed on the screen, pulling me from my half-sleep. I fumbled for the device, instantly alert despite my drowsiness.

"Sarah!" Her voice bubbled with excitement through the speaker."I did it!"

"What happened?" I immediately sat upright on the chaise lounge,my heart racing with anticipation though I already had an inkling of what she meant.


"Philip had the surgery!" Betty's voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper,as if someone might be eavesdropping. "Let's meet to discuss. The usual place,thirty minutes."

I ended the call, unable to suppress the smile spreading across my face.I squeezed the phone in my hand, savoring the sweet tasteof victory on my tongue. Oh Philip, you finally couldn't escape my grasp after all.

Rising from the lounge, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. The designer maternity dress hugged my still-slim figure perfectly, barely showing any sign of the pregnancy I was using as leverage. I traced my fingers over my abdomen, feeling a strange mixture of triumph and something else I couldn't quite name.

Pushing open the door to Café Laurent, I immediately spotted Betty at our usual corner table. The upscale café on Madison Avenue was one of her favorites-quiet enough for private conversations yet public enough to maintain appearances. She sat perfectly poised, her Hermes scarf artfully arranged, sipping tea with practiced elegance.

Betty had proven to be the perfect accomplice. Who would have thought she'd force her own son to undergo sterilization surgery just to ensure I would carry this baby to term? The irony wasn't lost on me.

"How did you manage it?" I asked eagerly as I slid into the seat across from her. Just this morning. Philip had been shouting his refusal at me,and I had wanted nothing more than to slap that self-righteous look off his face.


Betty took a deliberate sip of her Earl Grey, purposely drawing out the moment. "I threatened to jump from the rooftop."

"You're joking, right?" I blinked in disbelief, finding it hard to imagine this impeccably dressed woman standing at the edge of a building.

"You should have seen his face." Betty shook her head with a slight smile,a glimmer of cunning in her eyes. "He's hardly ever defied me his entire life,and thistime was no exception."

"Then what happened?" I leaned forward,completely captivated by her story.

"He agreed immediately," Betty continued, setting down her teacup with precision. "I supervised the whole process via video call, watched him walk into the hospital, and saw the procedure completed."

I nodded, a satisfied smile curling at the corners of my lips. Success! Now Philip could never have children with anyone else. The baby in my womb would be the sole heir to the Baker family fortune. Let's see him try to mistreat me now. Betty truly was the perfect ally-I never imagined she would force her own son to undergo a vasectomy just to ensure I would give birth to this child. How ironic.



"However," Betty's brow furrowed, her voice suddenly tinged with confusion, "he said something strange afterward."

"What was it?" I asked,curiosity piqued.

"He said, 'From today on, I am no longer your son.'" Betty shook her head in disbelief. "How could that be possible? How could I not be his mother?"

"Perhaps he was just speaking out of anger?" I suggested tentatively,mentally calculating whether this might affect my plans.

"Certainly," Betty waved dismissively, brushing past the subject. "He'll come around once he calms down."

I was about to respond when a familiar wave of nausea rose from my stomach, my throat tightening. Damn morning sickness, always striking at the most inconvenient moments.

"Excuse me, I need to use the restroom," I rose hurriedly, my hand instinctively covering my mouth.

In the cold, marble-tiled bathroom, I had just locked the stall door when my phone rang again. Philip's name flashed on the screen, my heart suddenly racing as if anticipating something ominous.

"Hello?" I worked to keep my voice steady.

"Sarah." Philip's voice was unnaturally calm, which unsettled me more than if he'd been shouting. "Very clever, bringing my mother into this when you couldn't manage me yourself."

I bit my lip, wondering how he had figured it out. "I was only thinking of the baby."



"Oh?" He let ouit a cold laugh. "Should I congratulate you on your ingenuity?"


My stomach dropped. How did he know? Had Betty told him? No.impossible. "I don't know what you're talking about," I feigned confusion,though my heart was pounding faster by the second.


"Stop pretending." Philip's voice was as cold as ice. "Did you think I wouldn't figure it out?"

I bit my lip harder, scrambling for an appropriate response in my paníc.
Damn it. I hadn't expected him to conect the dots so quickly.

"I was only thinking of the baby," I repeated lamely, already strategizing my next move.


I remained silent. Sometimes silence is the best defense. I couldn't risk saying anything that might give him more ammunition.

"I've been thinking," Philip suddenly said, "if I hadn't given up Annie for you, I wouldn't be in this mess."


Annie's name pierced my heart like a thorn. Even now, he couldn't forget her! That supposedly perfect wife, perfect mother. I hated how he always compared me to her.

"It's too late for regrets," I managed to control my tone, though internally I was seething. "You can't turn back now."

′′Iknow," Philip said, his voice carrying a strange tranquility. "But what I don't understand is why my own mother would side with you against me."

"Maybe I'm just more likable," I couldn't help but say smugly. This was my charm-I could always make people take my side.

"Well, starting today," his voice suddenly turned glacial, "I won't be giving her another cent for living expenses, and you won't be getting any either."

Those words hit me like a bucket of ice water. I froze, my brain temporarily unable to process this information.

"What... what did you say?" I could barely believe my ears.

"If she needs money, she can ask you for it." Philip continued, each word like an ice cube. "It's no longer my concern."

My heart sank. The plan had gone awry. In my scenario, after the surgery,Philip should have valued the child in my womb even more, not become more detached.

"She's your mother." I played my final card.

"I don't care about her anymore," Philip stated calmly. "I still have Brian.Worst case, I'll apologize to him and seek his forgiveness."

Brian... that name again. I hated how he always mentioned Brian, as if that child were some kind of treasure. In reality, Philip had never properly cared for Brian, yet now he was pretending to be a concerned father?Such hypocrisy!

"What? You can't do this!" I exclaimed in shock, momentarily at a loss for words.


On the other end, Philip coldly hung up, leaving me standing alone in the bathroom stall,utterly bewildered.

Deep breaths, Sarah, stay calm. I told myself. The situation wasn't out of control yet; it just required a strategy adjustmnent. After all, I still carried his child, and I still had Betty as my trump card.



Having composed myself. I pushed open the bathroom door. Betty was still waiting at the table, her expression inquisitive. It was time to tell her about Philip's decision, though I had no idea how she would react...

###Chapter 209: I Am His Mother...

Sarah's POV

"I won't be giving her another centfor living expenses, and you won't be getting any either." Philip's cold voice came through the phone,and then the call disconnected.

I stood in the coffee shop bathroom, staring at my phone screen in disbelief. This couldn't be happening! Philip had never refused any of my requests before, no matter how unreasonable. Even when I demanded he get a vasectomy-an absolutely outrageous request-he ultimately gave in.didn't he?

But his tone just now-that coldness and detachment-it was like hearing a complete stranger. I could hardly connect this person with the weak-willed man who had always bent to my every whim.

A thought suddenly flashed through my mind, making me laugh bitterly at myself: Philip probably never truly loved me, just as he never truly loved Annie. He only loved himself. His anger now wasn't because I had hurt his feelings, but because I had injured his body and his pride. These successful men were all the same-their true bottom line wasn't love, but face.

Poor Annie, wasting so many years with such a selfish man. No wonder she could so quickly fall into Howard Thompson's arms. Thinking about this, I suddenly felt a strange sympathy for Annie, despite always hating that gentle, virtuous facade she maintained.

I composed myself, wiping away the tears of anger that had escaped from the corners of my eyes, and carefully put back on that meticulously designed mask of sweetness before preparing to return to Betty.

When I returned to our table at the café. Betty was elegantly sipping her tea. Seeing her looking so supremely confident. I almost felt a twinge of pity-she had no idea about the shock that was coming.

"What's wrong, dear? You look pale," Betty asked with concern as she set down her teacup.

I took a deep breath and got straight to the point: "Philip just called me.He said he won't be giving me any living expenses anymore."

Betty's expression barely changed, merely giving a dismissive wave of her hand. "Don't worry. He might not care about an unborn child, but I am his mother. He won't abandon me. When he gives me money, I'll pass some to you."

Hearing her speak like this, I felt a surge of irritation. Had she even understood what I said? "But he specifically said he won't be giving you any money either," I emphasized, hoping this fact would penetrate her shell of confidence.

Betty finally showed a flicker of surprise, but quickly shook her head with a smile. "Impossible! Even if I forced him to do something he didn't want to do, I'm still his mother. He wouldn't cut off my funds over such a small matter. That boy, from childhood to adulthood-when has he ever truly rebelled against me?"

I suppressed the urge to roll my eyes. Betty's understanding of her son was clearly not as deep as she believed.

"Maybe you should call him yourself to confirm?" I suggested, while secretly worrying she might discover that I had concealed certain details of my conversation with Philip.

Betty nodded and pulled out her phone. "I will. He's just upset right now.I'm sure his response to me won't be much different from what he told you.I'll call and comfort him."

She dialed Philip's number, but all that came through was a busy signal.Betty's brow furrowed slightly-the first visible sign of her emotional disturbance.


"He's probably just on another call," she muttered to herself,and tried again, still unable to connect.

After several attempts, Betty's elegant facade began to crack. She borrowed the café's phone from a server. I noticed her fingers trembling slightly,which gave me a small jolt of satisfaction-seeing this usually confident woman display signs of panic wasn't an everyday occurrence.

This timne, the call connected. Betty gestured for me to lean in, and we listened together.

"Who is this?" Philip's voice came through, flat and devoid of any emotion.

"It's your mother!" Betty nearly shouted, shock and anger intermingling in her voice. "You've blocked my number?"

"Yes," Philip answered briefly.

My heart rate accelerated-he had really cut off contact with Betty!

"Why?" Betty pressed, the confidence in her voice now clearly shaken.

"Do you really not know?" Philip countered, with a calm in his tone I had never heard before. This wasn't his formerly indecisive attitude-he had changed.

Betty was momentarily speechless, while I felt a chill crawl up my spine.This new version of Philip felt unfamiliar, even somewhat frightening.

Philip continued, "When you threatened to jump off a building to force me into having surgery, you should have realized that my compliance would come at a price. I may have given in, but from now on, I won't listen to another word you say."

Betty's face turned pale as she gripped the phone tightly. "I was only doing what was best for you."

"I don't need that kind of help," Philip responded coldly. "And I won't be financially supporting Sarah either. Whether she keeps the child or terminates the pregnancy is her decision-it has nothing to do with me."

I felt dizzy. Philip was completely denaying any connection to this child! He spoke with such certainty, as if he truly didn't care. Had I completely misjudged his character? Or had my manipulation finally pushed him to a corner,inadvertently setting him free?

Betty was clearly panicking now. "Then who will take care of you in your old age?" she threw out what she believed to be her strongest threat.

"If Brian is willing to forgive me, I still have him as a son. If not,I'll grow old alone," Philip answered with such firmness that both Betty and I were stunned.

Brian? He actually mentioned Brian? The son he had almost completely neglected? I realized Philip might be serious-he would rather try torepair his relationship with his ex-wife and son than continue being manipulated by us.


Betty began to cry. "How could you do this? You're throwing away all my



good intentions! Who do you think I forced you to have this surgery for?Wasn't it to give you another child?"

"You didn't do it for anyone but yourself," Philip's voice was ruthlessly cold. "You did it to satisfy your need for control. When I had that surgery,you must have felt proud that you could still control your son. Whether you blackmailed or manipulated me into sacrificing my reproductive rights doesn't matter anymore."


I had to admit. Philip's analysis was spot on. Neither Betty nor I truly cared about him or the child-we just wanted to control him,albeit through different means.

"No, that's not true,"Betty's voice trembled with tears.

"Whether it's true or not doesn't matter anymore," Philip concluded calmly.
"All you need to know is that from today onward, we have no relationship." Then, the call disconnected.

"Philip!" Betty screamed, immediately trying to call back, only to discover she had indeed been blocked.


I watched as Betty frantically pulled out her own phone, making several calls-but all attempts ended in failure. Philip had severed contact with her completely.


Watching this once proud woman completely break down in public, I felt strangely calm inside. What did Philip's departure mean to me? When one door closes, another inevitably opens.

Robert was still obsessed with me, ready to become my fallback option at any time. But my gaze had already fallen on Howard Thompson-that"good man" who gave up dating for his niece. A perfect target who cared

about single mothers.

"This can't be happening..." Betty murmured, her voice filled with despair.
"I am his mother..."

Hah,how pitiful.


###Chapter 210: At Least Not Now

Sarah's POV

I quietly closed the door to my apartment, feeling a strange sense of calm wash over me. The almost hysterical confrontation with Betty at the caféhad drained me emotionally, yet now I felt unusually composed.Perhaps it was because I'd grown accustomed to crises like this one. The rule of survival isn't about getting knocked down-it's about adapting and evolving.


My hand unconsciously moved to my abdomen. This child-Robert's child,not Philip's-had become both my bargaining chip and my burden.But that was fine. Sarah Johnson would never allow life to defeat her.

Taking a deep breath, I picked up my phone and dialed Robert's number.In the few seconds waiting for him to answer, I quickly organized my thoughts and emotions. With Robert, I needed to appear vulnerable and helpless-that was the most effective way to trigger his protective instincts.

"Hello?" Robert's confused voice came through the phone. He certainly hadn't expected to hear from me.

"Do you have time to talk?" I deliberately made my voice sound shaky and fragile. Robert could never resist this tone; his compassion was his greatest weakness, and I needed to exploit it.

"What's wrong? What happened?" Sure enough, his tone immediately softened. Men are such easily manipulated creatures.

"Philip wants me to terminate the pregnancy," I said softly, pressing my lips together to create a sense of suppressed pain. "He says he doesn't want the child anymore."

This was, of course, a lie-an exaggeration of Philip's angry words.He had only cut off financial support, never mentioning anything about terminating the pregnancy. But lies were my weapons, and I wielded them with practiced skill.

The brief silence on the other end made me secretly pleased. Robert was surely shocked by my words, his emotions fluctuating exactly as I had anticipated. He had always yearned for this child, desired a complete family. I knew this was his most vulnerable spot.

"What do you want to do?" he finally spoke, his voice filled with the concern I had expected.

"I want to keep the baby, of course," I made my voice sound as if I might burst into tears at any moment. "This is our child." As I said this, I almost laughed at how excellent my performance was.

Another silence followed as I knew he was weighing his options. Robert's greatest weakness was being too easily controlled by emotions-one of the main reasons his family business had gone bankrupt. He valued feelings too much and wasn't rational enough.

"If you don't mind living a modest life with me, then tell Philip the truth.Move in with me. I'll work hard to support you and the baby," he said finally.

Perfect. He took the bait. I laughed inwardly but outwardly showed hesitation.Reunite with Robert? That was absolutely not my plan. If I did that, I would completely lose any chance with Howard. Howard was the real target-he had everything I wanted: wealth, status, influence, and that special sympathy for single mothers.

"Robert, I..." I drew a small breath, thinking about how to reject him

without hurting his pride. "You know how high my living standards are."


"Sarah," his tone became firmer, with a naive sort of optimism,"If this project I'm working on succeeds, I can make a lot of money afterward.Howard thinks highly of my abilities, and if I perform well this time,there will definitely be more opportunities in the future."


Howard's name made my heart race. The fact that he mentioned Howard thought highly of his abilities might provide another avenue for me to approach Howard. But for now, I needed to continue my performance.

"Then I'll keep stalling Philip for a while longer. Once your project succeeds, I'll come straight to you. That would be better for you and for the baby," I bit my lip, making it sound like I was considering his best interests.


"You can't come now?" His voice noticeably cooled. I could sense his suspicion and needed a more convincing reason.

"Robert, darling," I switched to a caring tone, as if genuinely concerned for him, "My situation right now is very delicate. I need to be especially careful during pregnancy. If I moved in with you, who would take care of me?"


I continued in 'a gentle voice tinged with worry: "And then there's Max.You know how well-adjusted he is at that school, how much psychological damage a transfer would cause him. And the tuition at that school..."I deliberately left the sentence unfinished, letting him imagine the figure, "T'm just worried this would put too much pressure on you."

The silence on the other end told me my words had hit their mark. Robert had always harbored deep insecurities, especially regarding his financial capabilities. He knew he couldn't provide the lifestyle Philip could offer.

"Although Philip is angry right now, I believe..." I carefully chose my words, "If I persist, he'll eventually calm down and continue supporting our living expenses. That's the best arrangement for Max and for the baby in my womb."

Robert remained silent for a long time. When he finally spoke, I could hear the defeat in his voice: "So you called me just to tell me your decision?
You never considered coming back to me?"

I smirked coldly to myself, but over the phone, I responded softly: "That's right. At least not now." I needed to keep a backup plan in case my strategy to approach Howard failed-Robert would still be a viable option.

"I understand," Robert's tone carried a hint of resignation that surprised me. He was more rational than I had anticipated.

"Maybe Philip is just temporarily angry. Don't take it too hard," hewas actually comforting me,which was both ridiculous and pathetic.

"Thank you for understanding," I pretended to be grateful, "I want to fight back, but I have to be realistic. Philip is still immersed in his feelings for Annie."


"I can only wait for his anger to subside. Then he can continue supporting me and the baby," I continued, deliberately injecting a carefully calculated resignation into my voice. "That's what's best for everyone."

"But isn't that very difficult for you?" Robert asked, his concern sounding so sincere it almost made me feel a twinge of guilt-almost.

"Of course it's difficult," I admitted, "but for the baby, it's all worth it."This line always worked, especially with fathers.

"Robert..." I softened my voice, as if returning to the past, "Do you

remember when we first got together?"

"I do." His voice softened as well, and I knew he was sinking into memories.

"Those days with you were beautiful," I said in a nostalgic tone,while mentally calculating my next move. "You always loved me so much,spoiled me. You never forced me to do things I didn't like."

"You were always so attentive to me," I continued, deliberately making my voice sound sincere. "It's because I know how much you care about me that I was willing to have a child with you."


I glanced at my nails, waiting for his response. This emotional appeal always worked on him.


"How much better things would be if my family was still wealthy,"he sighed,his voice full of regret.

"Then you would be by my side right now, and we'd be expecting our second child," I softly replied. This hypothetical scenario comforted him but held absolutely no attraction for me.

The phone fell silent, and I knew the conversation had served its purpose.
I had ensured Robert wouldn't do anything rash while also leaving myself plenty of room to maneuver.

"I need to go," I said, "Someone's at the door." Another small lie, but sufficient to end this call.

"All right, take care," Robert said, his voice still full of concern,′′Ifyou need any help, call me anytime."

"Thank you," I said, and quickly hung up.


I walked to my vanity table and looked at myself in the mirror, a slight smile playing on my lips. How amusing that men alwaysthink themselves clever, yet are so easily manipulated. Philip, Robert-they were merely pawns in my life, replaceable at any time.

I gently stroked my abdomen, calmly calculating my next move. Philip was no longer useful, Robert too incompetent, but Howard was different.He had money, status, and sympathy for single mothers. Whatever Annie had obtained, I could get too-and more.

###Chapter 211:Is Howard Home?

Annie's POV

I slowly opened my eyes, feeling a profound sense of peace and deep satisfaction. Howard was no longer beside me, but his familiar scent still lingered on the pillow, a comforting reminder of the life we were building together. Thinking back to the beautiful evening we shared, I couldn't help but smile. Without Lucy at home, we had finally been able to enjoy a quiet, uninterrupted night of deep conversation and connection.

Rolling over, I checked my phone on the nightstand—8:30. My God, I'd slept this late! I hurriedly got out of bed, deciding to use this precious time to catch up on the illustration projects I'd been putting off. These commissioned works had been piling up, and I needed to maintain my professional independence.

Instead of looking for Howard, I sat directly at the desk and immersed myself in creating. The image of a little girl gradually took shape on the paper—she had golden curls and bright eyes, much like Lucy. I added a teddy bear companion, imagining the joy on Lucy's face when she saw it.

A gentle knock at the door interrupted my thoughts. "Come in," I responded without looking up.

Howard entered, leaning against the doorframe with gentle eyes. He wore a simple white t-shirt, looking relaxed and attractive.

"Working so intently?" he asked, his voice carrying a hint of amusement. He walked closer, standing behind me. "Is this for Lucy?"

"Yes," I shifted to give him a better view. "I think she'll love it."

"She'll absolutely love it," Howard's hand rested lightly and reassuringly on my shoulder. "But do you know what time it is? It's 10:10. It's not good to go this long without breakfast."

He looked at me with an attentiveness that warmed my heart. Unlike my past marriage, where my needs were ignored, Howard noticed every detail. "I've prepared congee and some side dishes. Come eat while it's hot," he said.

Setting aside my work, I followed him downstairs. As we walked, his hand naturally came to rest on my waist—a small, intimate gesture that made me feel truly cherished.

We entered the dining room, and the aroma of fresh food filled the air. Howard had even cooked the congee longer because he knew I preferred a softer texture. This level of care was something I was still getting used to, a beautiful contrast to the neglect I had endured before.

As I took a spoonful, I realized an ironic truth: my past failures weren't my fault; I had simply been in the wrong environment. With Howard, every meal, every conversation, and every touch was a testament to what a healthy relationship should be.

Just as I was savoring this peace, the doorbell rang. I walked to the security monitor, and my heart instantly froze.

Betty Baker, Philip's mother, was standing at the entrance. The past was knocking on my door, but this time, I wasn't the same woman she once knew.
###Chapter 212: Like Mother, Like Daughter

Annie's POV

Through the monitor, I watched as Betty Baker looked around and then leaned closer to the intercom, her voice surprisingly calm and polite:

"Tm looking for Howard Thompson. Is Howard home?"

My finger hovered over the response button, but I couldn't bring myself to press it. How should I respond? Should I pretend no one was home? Or should I directly address this woman who had once been so aggressive toward me? I took a deep breath, trying to calm my racing heart.

Just then, Howard returned from the kitchen carrying a plate of freshly cut pineapple and strawberries. His footsteps made me turn slightly. When he saw my expression, he immediately sensed something was wrong.

"Who's at the door?" he asked, brow furrowing slightly as he set down the fruit plate.

"Betty Baker," my voice was tight, "Philip's mother."

Howard's eyes widened slightly before returning to their usual calm. He placed the fruit plate on a nearby table and stood beside me, his shoulder lightly touching mine. That small contact provided immense comfort.

"How did she find this place?" he asked quietly.

"I don't know," I admitted, watching Betty impatiently press the doorbell again. "She shouldn't know I'm living here."

Through the intercom, we heard her repeat: "I'm looking for Howard Thompson.Is Howard home?"



Howard turned to me, eyebrow slightly raised. "Do you think I should see her?"


I hesitated for a moment, curious about his relationship with Betty. "You've... met her a few times before, right? What kind of person is she to you?"

Howard's lips curved slightly upward, his eyes carrying a hint of mockery."Do I seem like the type of person who comes running whenever someone calls? Especially someone like her."


The disdain in his tone reminded me that Howard had indeed encountered Betty several times before,but those occasions had never been pleasant. Betty always positioned herself as an "Upper East Side socialite,"attempting to boss everyone around, but Howard never played along.

"Good point," I laughed softly, feeling slightly more relaxed.

Howard picked up the internal phone, speaking calmly to security: "Just tell her I'm not home."

Through the monitor, I watched the security guard approach Betty,his tone professional and polite: "I'm sorry, Mrs. Baker. Mr. Thompson left early this morning with his daughter and isn't here now."

Betty clearly didn't believe him. Her chin lifted slightly-that arrogant gesture I knew all too well. "Just tell him I want to discuss something about Annie Baker. I'm sure he'll want to see me."

Hearing my name from her lips, my back instantly straightened. She had come here because of me? What did she want to say? A mix of curiosity and wariness rose within me.

"But Mr. Thompson really isn't here," the guard insisted. "If you'd like to leave your contact information, I can pass along your message."


I turned to Howard, an idea forming in my mind. "Maybe you should go see her," I said quietly. "I'm curious about what she has to say about me.If she's spreading lies, at least I'll know what those lies are."

Howard studied my expression, his gray eyes seeming to see through my unease. After a moment, he nodded: "All right, I'll see her. But," his voice softened, his hand gently squeezing my shoulder, "don't worry. I know you, far better than she claims to."

That simple affirmation gave me immense courage. In the five years I had spent with Philip, he had never believed in me so unconditionally.

I remained inside, watching the situation through the security monitor.Howard's figure appeared on screen as he walked toward the main gate,speaking quietly to the security guard.

"Sorry, I just got back," he said to the guard, then turned to Betty. "You may speak now."

Betty's expression changed. Her meticulously maintained face adopted a look I knew all too well-that expression when she believed she possessed absolute truth. I noticed she was wearing an expensive Chanel suit today,her hair perfectly styled, every inch the Upper East Side socialite.

"Mr. Thompson," her voice carried an affected elegance, "I've come here with good intentions. I believe you've chosen to be with Annie Baker primarily because you don't know her true character."

She paused,seemingly for dramatic effect: "Once you understand her true nature,you'll certainly reconsider your relationship."

I saw that Howard's posture remained unchanged, his voice as calm as ever:′′Idon't think so."



"Don't be so quick to judge!" Betty raised her voice slightly. "After all,how long have you known her? A few months? I've known her for over five years. I'm certainly more aware of what kind of person she is,wouldn't you agree?"


Howard nodded expressionlessly: "Continue."

This brief response was clearly not what Betty had expected,but she quickly adjusted her strategy: "You know Annie comes from a single-parent family in Boston, right?"

"Yes," Howard replied, his voice carrying a hint of impatience, "Is that a problem?"

Betty's expression grew more contemptuous, and she lowered her voice as if sharing some earth-shattering secret: "Her father didn't actually die. That was just a lie she and her mother made up. The truth is, her father saw through their true nature, realized their terrible character, and chose to leave. He felt thnat every day spent with them was torture, which is why he abandoned them."

Hearing these blatant lies, I felt a wave of anger surge from my chest to my head. My father had died in a serious car accident when I waseight years old, an experience that had been incredibly painful for both my mother and me. How could Betty so maliciously distort the facts!

I almost rushed toward the front door, completely forgetting my original plan to just observe.

On the monitor, I saw Howard's mouth twitch slightly. He didn't directly refute Betty's lies but maintained an astonishing calmness. He merely nodded slightly, his eyes holding a sharp gleam I was growing increasingly familiar with.

"Please continue," he said, his voice so calm it was almost dangerous. "I'm very interested in hearing all of your 'knowledge' about Annie."

Betty clearly hadn't noticed the warning in his tone and simply nodded,as if she had finally found someone willing to listen to her.

Betty raised her chin, her face bearing a smug expression.

"Her mother is a complete parasite," she said, each word deliberately contemptuous, "and Annie is just like her mother."
Howard's eyebrows raised slightly, but he remained silent. I noticed his fingers lightly tapping along the edge of his pocket-a small habit when he was feeling impatient.

"What did she do after getting married?" Betty asked rhetorically, her tone exaggerated. "Refused to work! Just content being a housewife, like some outdated TV character."

She stepped closer to Howard, as if sharing a secret.

"And she constantly asked Philip for money to support her incompetent mother." She made a disgusted face, her jewelry glittering in the sunlight. "In today's society, can you believe women like this still exist? Doesn't she know how hard it is to make money on Wall Street?"

Howard's expression remained calm, but I could see a spark of anger flash in his eyes.

At that mnoment, I pushed open the front door, feeling my face burning with anger. "You say I took your son's money?" My voice was calm,though my heart was turbulent.

Betty turned to me, a flicker of surprise in her eyes before she resumed her

superior demeanor. "What else? Can you deny it?"

Betty's confidence transformed the anger in my chest into a strange calm.I couldn't help but laugh, a laugh containing years of accumulated anger and relief.


"If that's the case, Betty," I slowly walked toward her, "I suggest we call your precious son right now and confront him face toface."

Howard stepped back,giving me space, his eyes shining with approval and support. Betty retreated slightly, clearly not expecting me to face her so directly.

"I would be delighted," I continued,′′togo through,item by item,exactly how much of his money I supposedly used, and how that money was spent!"

I looked straight into her eyes, feeling myself stand taller. I was no longer the Annie who would shrink away from her harassment.

"In fact," my voice was firm, my finger lightly tapping my chest, "I would be happy to have Philip tell you himself that I refused his financial support for my mother because I didn't want my marriage to have any connection with money!"


A flicker of panic crossed Betty's beautiful face. She reflexively adjusted her silk scarf, her meticulously groomed eyebrows trembling slightly. I knew I had hit a nerve. In her world, all relationships revolved around interests and money. She could never understand that my marriage to Philip had never been about money.

"You're deliberately misinterpreting what I said," she tried to salvage the situation, but her voice had lost its previous confidence.

###Chapter 213: My Son Is Especially Generous

Annie's POV

"You're deliberately misinterpreting what I said," Betty said, but the confidence in her voice had already wavered.

I looked directly into hereyes,feeling myself stand taller than ever before.In that moment, I suddenly realized that I was no longer the Annie who would meekly bow her head in Betty's presence.

"If that's the case, Betty, then let's call your son over for a confrontation,"I suggested, my voice surprisingly calm.

"I would be delighted to go through with him, item by item, exactly how much of his money I supposedly used, and how that money was spent!"

Betty froze for a moment, clearly not expecting me to face her accusations so directly. She quickly adjusted her posture, the corners of her mouth curling into that contemptuous smile I knew all too well.

"You said it yourself!" she responded with almost gleeful malice,her expression seeming to say: you're digging your own grave.

Howard stood nearby, his gaze moving between us, but he chose to let me handle the situation. I appreciated his trust-something Philip had never given me.

′′Myson is especially generous," Betty continued, deliberately raising her voice,"The jewelry he gave Sarah, even the cheapest pieces were worth millions.You were his wife-"

"I'm divorced from hima," I frowned, interrupting her, "so at most, I'm his ex-wife."

This correction visibly displeased Betty, but she quickly adjusted her strategy: "You were once Philip's wife. Even if he didn't lavish money on you,he certainly wouldn't have left you wanting."

"If we've decided to call him over," I cut off her meaningless rhetoric,"then what's the point of all this? Let's just call him directly."

A fleeting expression I couldn't quite read crossed Betty's face. She suddenly became hesitant, her fingers nervously fidgeting with her expensive silk scarf. Finally, she turned to Howard: "May I borrow your phone?"

The request surprised me. Did she not have Philip's contact information?Or had something happened between them that I wasn't aware of?

Howard didn't immediately respond, instead looking to me first. This small gesture sent a warm current through my heart. I nodded slightly,and only then did he hand his phone to Betty.

Betty took the phone and quickly dialed Philip's number. Philip's familiar voice came through the speaker: "Hello? Mr. Thompson, did you need something?"

"It's your mother," Betty immediately replied, her tone suddenly stern, "T'm at Howard's doorstep. You should come over. By the way, Annie has something she wants to discuss with you."

The brief silence on the other end made my heart race. Although I had prepared myself to face Philip, the thought of the impending confrontation stil filled me with tension.

"Alright, I'll be there," Philip finally answered, his voice carrying a complex emotion I couldn't quite understand.

Betty hung up and returned the phone to Howard, her face once again displaying that self-assured expression: "My son will be here any minute!If you don't want him to expose you personally, you'd better confess now.Perhaps Howard will still give you a chance if he sees you being honest."

Howard raised an eyebrow, a hintof weary amusement flashing in his eyes,but he remained silent. I understood him well enough to know he wouldn't easily interject in this situation. He trusted me to handle it properly.

"Philip isn't here yet. No matter what I say, you'll think I'm lying." I said calmly, "so let's just wait for Philip to arrive."

"Fine," Betty answered curtly, then turned to Howard, her eyes suddenly sparkling with an almost theatrical concern, "Howard, you have no idea how outrageous Annie has been since marrying my son, constantly bleeding him dry!"

Howard's expression remained calm, but I noticed a flicker of disgust pass through his eyes. Betty clearly misinterpreted his silence and continued on:"She never worked, just stayed at home living off my son. That might have been acceptable-my son is capable, he can support a woman!"

Listening to Betty's accusations, I felt an absurd urge to laugh. After all the neglect and indignities I had endured during those five years of marriage, in Betty's eyes, I had somehow become a "parasite"?

"What's worse is that she even had my son supporting her own mother!"Betty's voice rose a notch.

This time, Howard finally couldn't hold back:′′II remember correctly,your son didn't have much money when they first got married, didhe?"

The question clearly caught Betty off guard. Her brow furrowed slightly,

her lips pressed into a thin line as she considered how to respond.

"Him not having money only proves how bad Annie was!" she finally argued, "To ensure a good life for herself and her mother, she constantly pushed my son to work! You have no idea how much my son suffered during that time."

I almost laughed out loud at this absurd logic. In Betty's world,encouraging one's husband to work had somehow become a sin?

Howard's gaze sharpened: "May I ask something?"

"Go ahead," Betty had been interrupted, but didn't seem to mind.

"How much did your son give Annie monthly back then?" Howard asked deliberately.

The question hit the mark. Betty visibly faltered, her eyes darting around as she clearly tried to fabricate a reasonable figure.

"Initíally, he gave five thousand each to Annie and her mother, so ten thousand in total, I suppose?" she said offhandedly, the uncertainty in her tone betraying her.

I shook my head gently: "Your son was still in the startup phase of his business then. Far from making money, he was actually putting his own funds into the company. Under these circumstances, how exactly was he able to provide ten thousand to support me and my mother?"

Betty's expression began to crack: "Maybe he didn't give that much at first,but later, after his business succeeded and he started making money... he did give you money then, right?"

"Yes, he did," I admitted, painful memories of those days surfacing, "but it

wasn't five thousand, and he never gave my mother anything. He gave me only three thousand per month."

"Impossible!" Betty sharply refuted, "Not to mention jewelry, the clothes he bought for Sarah cost hundreds of thousands each. Are you saying that your living expenses for several years were worth less than one of Sarah's outfits?"


Her words were like a dull knife scraping across scars on my heart.Yes,Philip was exactly that kind of person. He spent lavishly on Sarah while being incredibly stingy with me. But these past hurts could no longer wound me now.

I didn't answer Betty's challenge, instead lifting my chin to indicate the direction of the entrance: "Your son has arrived. If you don't believe me,you can ask him directly."

Betty turned to see Philip and immediately switched to an eager expression: "Son, you're finally here!"

I took a deep breath and exchanged a glance with Howard. He nodded slightly, his eyes filled with unconcealed support and trust. This was the greatest difference between my relationships with Philip and Howard-Philip had never truly respected me, while Howard had treated me as an equal partner from day one.

Meeting Philip's gaze, I felt an unprecedented calmness. Whatever happened next, I was no longer the Annie who would compromise herself just to please others.

###Chapter 214: It Feels So Good

Annie's POV

I stood at the entrance of Howard's mansion, eyes fixed on Philip who had just arrived. My former husband looked more exhausted than usual. The moment Betty spotted him, her eyes lit up as if she'd seen her savior.

"Son, you're finally here!" Her voice brimmed with expectation as she hurried toward Philip, practically dragging him to her side.

I could feel Howard standing behind me, not too far away. His presence gave me tremendous strength, like a silent pillar of support.

"Hurry,tell Howard how terrible Annie was when you were together!"Betty urged, her voice eager and commanding. She lifted her chin high,that familiar air of superiority returning to her demeanor. "She constantly pushed you to work, making you earn money to support her and her mother!"

Philip's face turned pale. He looked at Betty with a mixture of confusion and irritation.

"You called me here for this?" His voice was low and controlled.

Seeing his reaction, I found myself feeling oddly amused by the situation.

"Perfect timing," I said calmly to Philip, "since all three of us are here,everyone's present. Let's pull up the complete transaction records in front of your mother, so she can see for herself."

I held my head high, looking directly into Betty's eyes-those eyes that once intimidated me no longer held the same power. Though I knew I had nothing to feel guilty about, the arguments and accusations from this

mother and son duo were still vivid in my memory.

"Please do!" Betty responded challengingly, her eyes gleaming with confidence, "I would very much like to show Howard how irresponsibly you squandered and wasted money!"

Howard remained silent throughout this confrontation, but his presence behind me felt solid as a mountain. I unconsciously leaned back slightly,almost feeling the warmth of his body.

Betty waited a few seconds, and seeing Philip still standing motionless, she frowned: "What are you waiting for? Hurry up and show us the transaction records!"

I noticed a layer of fine sweat on Philip's forehead, and his breathing had become rapid. It seemed this conversation was making him more uncomfortable than I had anticipated.

"Be quiet!" Philip suddenly exploded, his voice sharper than I had imagined.

Betty stared at him in disbelief, as if looking at a stranger: "You're actually yelling at me? Telling me to be quiet? All for this woman?"

The muscles in, Philip's face tensed as he looked both angry and pained:"Aren't you very clear about how much money I gave her? After all, it was you who suggested I give her three thousand dollars a month. Do you really think that was a lot?"

I hadn't expected Philip to reveal this fact. It meant that my meager monthly allowance of three thousand dollars had actually been Betty's suggestion. Hearing this news, I felt a strange calmness, as if a puzzle had finally been solved.

Betty's voice trembled slightly: "But after you became wealthy, didn't you secretly increase her allowance behind my back?"

Philip's expression became complex, as if scrutinizing his mother's words:"Who told you that?"


"Sarah, of course. Isn't that right?" Betty answered without hesitation.

"Sarah." When this name came from Betty's lips, I couldn't help but give a cold laugh. That name which once caused me so much heartache now only evoked a sense of absurdity. I could almost see the final piece of the puzzle falling into place-how Sarah had carefully woven lies, how she had sown poisonous seeds in the cracks of my marriage, how she had successfully made Philip and Betty misunderstand me.

"Of course it was Sarah," I said softly, with a hint of sarcasm in my voice,"who else could it be?"


Philip seemed to have some kind of realization in that moment, his gaze becoming sharp and pained: "She lied to you. I never increased Annie's living allowance."

Betty was stunned, her confidence beginning to waver: "But you must have given money to her mother,right?"

"No, I didn't," Philip's voice was low, carrying a trace of regret I rarely heard, "When we first got married, didn't you repeatedly warn me not to indulge their bad habits? I never forgot that."

So Philip's coldness and disrespect toward my mother stemmed from Betty's "warnings," I suddenly understood those small details that had once troubled me-why Philip always found excuses to leave whenever my mom visited; why he never agreed to my buying gifts for her; why he was

always indifferent to her health issues.

"So that's why you treated my mother that way?" I stared at Philip, my voice trembling slightly, "Because your mother said we had 'bad habits"?That single mother who raised me with such hardship?"

I actually felt a touch of pity for this grown main controlled by his mother.

Betty was momentarily speechless, her expression gradually shifting from shock to embarrassment. I could see her thinking about how to counterattack, how to regain control of the situation.

I decided to take this opportunity to clear everything up once and for all:"First, let me clarify something. During my first year with your son, he didn t even give me that three thousand dollars."

Remembering that time, my throat tightened. Those nutritious breakfasts prepared early in the morning that no one appreciated; those carefully selected gifts that were scorned; those interrupted conversations and ignored suggestions. How hard I had tried to be a good wife, squeezing out every minute to care for the family, only to be met with coldness and mockery.


"You know what, Philip?" I looked at him, my voice calm yet filled with undisguised disappointment, "I used to think the problem was with me,that I could never do well enough, that I was never good enough."

"In the second to fourth years, he gave me three thousand dollars monthly,and in the last two years, he didn't give me a penny." I stated these facts calmly, surprised at the steadiness in my voice. "In other words,during our six years together, he gave me a total of only $108,000, averaging just $1,500 per month."

Betty's eyes widened slightly, but she quickly regained her composure: "What,you think $1,500 is too little? I've already told Howard you would never be satisfied. Any living allowance he could give you was already very generous!"

She quickly turned to Howard, trying to gain his support: "You see, Annie is completely ungrateful."


Faced with Betty's accusations, I felt a rush of blood to my cheeks. This absurdly extreme logic-portraying a husband's stinginess as generosity,describing my basic needs as greed? I couldn't help but laugh softly, not because it was funny, but because I finally saw through this distorted reality.


"Grateful?" I murmured, loud enough for everyone present to hear, "I should be immensely grateful for $1,500 a month while bearing all the responsibilities of a full-time wife and mother? Betty, do you really think that's reasonable?"


I was no longer afraid of her criticism. Those words that once kept me awake at night now sounded like nothing more than unreasonable accusations.


"Don't act like your son giving me this small amount of money every month was some great favor," I explained calmly, "The truth is, the only reason I was able to live comfortably all these years is because I found part-time work to pay for our household expenses."

Betty scoffed: "How much could you possibly earn from part-time work?"

So, those nights holding back tears; those days caring for a sick Brian all alone; those moments trying to maintain family harmony only to be met with blame. In the world of this mother and son, I was forever the outsider,

never good enough, never deserving of true respect.

I took a deep breath and raised my head: "You know what, I used to think I wasn't doing enough. Now I understand that no matter what I did,it would always be wrong in your eyes."

"At least enough to cover the costs of your son coming home every day to feast," I answered, no longer concerned with maintaining politeness toward her. "Did you think your son's fifty dollars a day was enough for three meals,three courses each, including meat and chicken?"

I felt as if I'd shed a burden I had carried for years: "But since you're making such a fuss about the money he gave me, I won't explain further.Let's just settle the accounts directly."

I pulled up detailed expense records on my phone, a habit of tracking every expenditure that I had maintained for years. Philip had once mocked this "penny-pinching" habit of mine, but now it had become my most powerful evidence.

"Here, look. These are the costs of items I purchased for your son." I handed my phone to Betty, looking into her eyes, no longer afraid of her judgment. "Calculate the total amount, and have him transfer the money to me."

As I handed over the phone, my hand was surprisingly steady.When Betty took the phone, our eyes met-the arrogance in hers was still present,yet for the first time mixed with a hint of unease and wavering.

This feeling was hard to describe-it wasn't the satisfaction of revenge, nor the joy of victory, but rather the relief and power of speaking up for myself for the first time in a long while. Like a block of wood that had been held underwater finally rising to the surface,able to breathe freely.

I felt Howard's hand gently rest on my shouder, that touch conveying silent support. And standing before me, Philip and Betty were no longer people I needed to please or fear, just a Chapter of my past. A Chapter I could finally face and move beyond.

"It feels so good," I thought to myself, my lips curving upward involuntarily, "so this is what true freedom feels like."

###Chapter 215: Make Him Pay

Annie's POV

"Calculate the total amount and have him transfer the money to me," my voice was calm and steady as I gently tapped the screen, handing my phone to Betty.

Strangely,my hand didn't tremble at all. Perhaps it was because I no longer felt afraid when facing Betty's scrutinizing eyes.

To be honest, I hadn't originally planned to ask for this money back. But listening to Betty ramble on about how I had supposedly squandered her son's money, a peculiar stubbornness welled up inside me. I was curious to see what expression she would wear when she discovered that throughout our entire marriage, it was actually "generous Annie" who had been subsidizing her "stingy son."

Betty took the phone with her trademark haughty expression,the corner of her mouth slightly upturned as if victory was already hers.

"Very well, let's see just how much money my son spent on you!" She deliberately raised her voice, her eyes filled with contempt, as if appraising a worthless item. "If you have any dignity at all, now that you've found a wealthy man like Howard, you should return all the money my son spent on you."

"No problem," I replied, almost cheerfully, unable to suppress a small smile."If the results show that I subsidized your son, please make sure he returns the money to me as well. Fair is fair."

Betty nodded confidently, like a queen graciously bestowing favors. "Of course."

She began scrolling through the screen, reviewing my detailed records.Interestingly, her expression gradually changed-first confusion, then disbelief, and finally complete shock. I coud see her brow furrowing tighter and tighter, almost knotting itself.

I almost laughed out loud at that moment. Each entry in those records was precise down to thecent, clearly displaying every expense I had paid for Philip. I had even thoughtfully excluded what I had spent on Brian.More ironically, she could see how generous I had been toward Philip-never questioning the price when purchasing luxury items for him,all using money I had earned from my illustrations.

Betty finally looked up, the confuIsion in her eyes almost tangible. She opened her mouth, then closed it, like a fish thrown onto shore.

I calmly broke the silence: "By the way, I haven't included what I spent on Brian. Since you've already abandoned him, I won't trouble you to return that money."


I could see my words cutting into her pride like a knife; her cheek twitched slightly.

Betty finally found her voice, though it no longer sounded so aggressive."You spent over two million dollars on my son in those six years? That's impossible!"

I raised an eyebrow, feeling a quiet satisfaction rise within me:′′Ifyou question any expenditure, you can point it out. I can tell you exactly when and where that money was spent on your son-I've kept every receipt."

Everything was clearly documented in those spreadsheets, accurate to the penny. I watched her gaze dart between me and the phone, as if facing an unsolvable puzzle.



Seeing her trying to comfort herself. I couldn't help but laugh inwardly.Some people always find ways to maintain their incorrect perceptions.

Betty quickly returned to her usual dominant posture, patting Philip's shoulder, her voice suddenly sharp: "Where are the records of things Philip bought for you? Show me those! There must be many,right?"

I noticed that Philip remained silent, his gaze firmly locked on me. His expression was complex-anger, confusion, and a hint of somethingI'd never seen before-respect?

I met his gaze without flinching. Once, this kind of stare would have made me nervous and retreat, but now I felt only a strange calmness.

"Enough," Philip finally spoke, his voice clearly tired and irritated. "Do you really need to embarrass my mother like this?"

His words made me chuckle softly. This was absurd.

"How interesting, Philip," I shook my head, my voice tinged with undisguisable sarcasm, "Your mother shows up uninvited at Howard's home, claiming that my mother and I were after your money. Even after I explained that I barely took any money from you, she still persisted in slandering me. I'm simply trying to prove my innocence, and yet you say I m embarrassing her?"


I paused,looking directly into his eyes: "Your logic is truly remarkable."

Strangely, his old trick of trying to make me feel guilty no longer worked on me. This realization brought an unprecedented sense of lightness.Thank heavens I had found the courage to leave Philip. Otherwise, my life would have been slowly drained by this relationship filled with accusations and manipulation.



"Yes," Philip answered without hesitation, his tone carrying that familiar condescension. "You know what she's like. You used to understand and tolerate her..."


I interrupted him: "I used to tolerate her because you were the person I loved." My voice was surprisingly calm, as if discussing today's weather.Feeling the tranquility within me, I continued: "I was willing to overlook your mother's behavior for your sake, to endure unnecessary criticism and insults."


I took a deep breath, feeling new strength flowing through my body: "But now. you're nothing more than a stranger to me. Your mother too. That being the case, why should I still inconvenience myself to make you happy? Why continue to allow you to violate my dignity?"

It felt so good to say these words, like truly breathing fresh air for the first time in years.


Philip stared at me intently, his lips pressed into a severe line. I could see the resentment and anger flickering in his eyes.

Just as the atmosphere almost solidified, I felt Howard's figure shift slightly,protectively standing in front of me. In that moment, a warm sense of security enveloped me.

"When a man marries a woman," Howard began, his voice maintaining that famailiar calm and restraint I knew well, yet each word powerful,"it should be because he truly loves her. He wants to live with her and create a beautiful future together."


###Chapter 216: See foryourself!

Annie's POV

"When a man marries a woman," Howard began, his voice maintaining that familiar calm and restraint I knew well, yet each word powerful,"it should be because he truly loves her. He wants to live with her and create a beautiful future together."


He paused. his gaze sweeping over Philip and Betty: "Not because she has a gentle personality, is accommodating to everyone, and won't cause him any trouble. I hope you understand this."

I watched Philip's expression grow increasingly gloomy with each of Howard's words. The discomfort and frustration in his eyes were almost visible. He understood better than anyone that Howard's understanding and respect for me was precisely what he had never given me.

"That sounds very noble," Philip sneered, his voice full of mockery,"but can you guarantee you're not with Annie because of her good temperament? Don't pretend you're more virtuous than me."

"I won't deny that Annie's character is indeed admirable," Howard's voice was deep and firm; I could feel that inviolable aura emanating from him,"but what I want most is for her to feel comfortable and respected when she's with me. Not constantly troubed by those around her, living each day in pain and self-doubt."


He paused momentarily, his gaze piercing through Philip:"You're already divorced, Annie has nothing to do with you, yet people connected to you still cause her trouble, trying to hurt her. Imagine what it was like during your marriage? Her life must have been much more difficult than it is now.1



I looked at Howard's straight back, a warmth flooding through my heart.He didn't even need to raise his voice, yet every word was like a sharp sword,precisely hitting its mark.


"Philip," Howard continued, his voice calm but unyielding, "From your actions. I don't see that you ever truly cared about Annie. So despite your claims of loving her, I believe you never really did. You just enjoyed the convenience of having her by your side, because with her there, no one would criticize you. That kind of life was comfortable for you."

His words were like a mirror, mercilessly reflecting Philip's true face:"After all. Annie intercepted all problems, bearing everything alone, while you never truly saw or acknowledged her sacrifices. I don't think she should be treated that way."

I felt my eyes moisten. For the first time in years, someone had clearly seen and articulated my situation.

After speaking, Howard reached back with his hand, without turning to look at me.


In that moment, my heart skipped a beat. He was inviting me to stand beside him, not hiding behind him. This small gesture conveyed his trust and equality-he wasn't protecting a weak person, but supporting an equal partner.

I froze for half a second, then reached out to take his warm hand,standing beside him. That feeling of being treated as an equal filled me with unprecedented strength.

Betty seemed still immersed in the shock of the numbers, not fully understanding the shift in dynamics, She blinked in confusion, then gently tugged on Philip's sleeve, trying to regain control of the conversation.

"Don't you want Annie to pay you back?"Her voice suddenly became anxious, "Or are you afraid Howard will discover that besides living expenses, you spent a lot of money on Annie every month?"

"Mother!" Philip's voice was filled with disbelief, clearly not expecting his own mother to be so uncooperative, even becoming an obstacle to him."Do you really need to see this?"

I could see a flash of desperation cross his face.

"Fine!" He finally yielded, his tone full of defeat.

He quickly took out his phone, roughly pulling up all financial transactions with me, almost throwing the phone at Betty. "Here! See for yourself!"

Betty's eyes suddenly lit up, as if discovering a lifeline. "Isn't this jewelry worth hundreds of thousands?" Her voice was filled with triumphant joy.

Philip frustratedly rubbed his forehead, like a child forced to reveal a secret."That was for Sarah." he almost gritted out the name.

I couldn't help but want to laugh. Sarah's name always slipped so easily from his lips, while in the last two years of our marriage,he rarely even spoke to me.

"And here are clothes worth over a hundred thousand!" Betty exclaimed,unwilling to give up. I could almost see the last glimmer of hope flickering in her eyes-she couldn't accept that her son might truly beso stingy.

Philip's expression grew even darker, like a cloud looming over his handsome face. "Those were also for Sarah."

Betty instantly deflated, like a punctured balloon. She mechanically


continued scrolling through the screen, her gaze hollow. I knew what she was seeing-those records clearly showed that almost all items valued over five hundred dollars were purchased for Sarah. And for me, apart from that pitiful three thousand dollar monthly allowance, there were hardly any decent gifts.


Finally,she stopped asking about specific items, just held up the phone,her voice nearly a whisper: "Is this for Sarah too?"

Philip nodded woodenly, like a resigned prisoner.

The calculations showed that across all platforms and transfers,besides the living allowance, Philip had spent just over ten thousand dollars on me throughout our entire relationship-a laughable figure compared to the hundreds of thousands he had spent on Sarah.

Betty fell completely silent, the arrogance on her face replaced by shock and confusion. She opened her mouth, looked at Philip, then at me, and finally could only helplessly shake her head. I knew what she was thinking-all words were stuck in her throat, unable to come out or be swallowed.


Looking at the scene before me, I suddenly felt a strange calmness. This wasn't the pleasure of revenge, but the relief of finally putting down a heavy burden.


After the calculations were complete, I spoke again, my voice soft yet firm:"From the money I spent on your son, subtract what he spent on me. The remaining amount-" I paused, seeing their expectant expressions, "doesn't need to be transferred to my account."

I turned to Howard, smiling slightly, then continued: "Just donate it in my name to a charity supporting single-parent families. I don't need this

money, but perhaps it can help those who truly need assistance."


###Chapter 217: Would Philip Be Willing to Pay That Much?

Annie's POV

I stood in the spacious entrance hall of Howard's mansion, my fingers slightly tightening, feeling an unfamiliar trembling of victory in my palm.Looking at the numbers clearly displayed on the phone screen, Betty's pale face and Philip's tense jawline gave me a strange sense of satisfaction. This was the first time I wasn't afraid to face their accusations; instead, I had silenced them with facts.


"From the money I spent on your son, subtract what he spent on me.The remaining amount-" I paused, seeing the mixture of expectation and apprehension on their faces. A calm power flowed through my body."Doesn't need to be transferred to my account."

I turned slightly toward Howard beside me, his steadfast gaze giving me unprecedented security. I straightened my back and continued, "Just donate it in my name to a charity supporting single-parent families."

Betty blinked her meticulously made-up eyes in shock, her gaze shifting between Philip and me. I watched the expressions change on her face,silently thinking to myself: she had originally intended to humiliate me with money, but now found herself trapped in her own snare.

"This isn't about getting the money; it's about completely severing ties with the past," I thought to myself as an unprecedented feeling of lightness washed over me.

Philip's eyes flashed with a complex emotion I couldn't quite interpret, but he simply nodded, "Fine," His voice was hoarse, as if this simple
owledgment had drained all his strength.

"Betty,you repeatedly claimed that my mother and I were draining your family's money," my voice was surprisingly calm, each word clear and forceful. "But now the truth is out, isn't it? The facts prove that I spent far more on your family than you spent on me."

I pointed at the financial records still displayed on the phone,each row of numbers like sharp knives cutting through the lies Betty had carefully woven over the years.

"Isn't it ironic? By your logic, your family was the one parasitizing off me."I laughed softly, feeling my facial expression somewhere between mockery and disbelief. "But you didn't just take my money; you also slandered me.The real villains are always the first to cry foul."

"When you married into our family, you became one of us!" Her voice carried a deliberate elegance. "The money you earned naturally belonged to the Baker family."

I felt a wave of absurd laughter rise from my chest. This kind of illogical,forceful reasoning was ridiculous to the extreme. What a fascinating mindset-in her world,rules were always one-directional, only applying to others.


"What interesting logic, Betty. When you accused me of spending your family's money, I suddenly wasn't family? But now that we've proven you spent my money, we're suddenly family again?" Each of my words carried sarcasm that had been difficult to express in the past.′′Isyour definition of 'family' always this conveniently flexible? No matter what happens, you're always right, aren't you?"

Betty narrowed her eyes, as if stungby my directness. "How could we be

wrong?" Her voice carried offended anger. "You're just trying to make us look stingy, trying to gain sympathy from Howard, aren't you?"

This ability to turn the tables was truly remarkable. I laughed coldly to myself-she was the one who came looking for trouble, but now she was playing the victim. This was her usual trick-always positioning herself on the moral high ground, no matter what.

Then she suddenly changed her line of attack,turning her gaze to Howard,who had remained silent throughout. "But how does Howard Thompson treat you? How much money has he spent on you? I guess you've just moved from one big house to an even bigger one, taking money from one man's hand to another's."

"In our household, domestic staff earn at least twenty thousand dollars monthly, and the chef's salary is the same. By that standard, Philip owes Annie not just the money she's already proven," Howard spoke calmly.

His words sent a wave of warmth through me. In his eyes, my contributions had value, a stark contrast to the attitude of Philip's family.A flash of panic crossed Betty's face, but she quickly adjusted her expression.


"I thought you left my son to live a luxurious life with Howard," Betty sneered, "but it seems you're still just a highly-paid servant in another household?"

I almost laughed out loud at this ridiculous argument. In Betty's eyes,women were either decorative accessories dependent on men or servants.She simply couldn't comprehend the concepts of equality and respect because, in her world, these qualities had never existed.

"The difference is choice, Betty," I responded calmly. "In Howard's home,T


m not required to do any housework or caretaking. Those duties are handled by professionals. When I was with Philip, I had to do all that work without receiving a cent of gratitude or compensation."


I turned to Howard, feeling a new confidence growing within me."In Howard's home. I only need to care for Lucy, earning eighty thousand dollars monthly for that."


I watched Betty's expression change from disdain to shock and couldn't help adding. "Two months' salary exceeds all the money Philip gave me in six years. That's the difference respect makes."

Betty's lips trembled slightly; for the first time, her eyes showed uncertainty.

Howard didn't stop there. "If we calculated the market value of all the services Annie provided during those six years-housekeeping, childcare,social arrangements,emotional support-it would be worth at least two hundred thousand dollars monthly. That's 2.4 million annually, over 10million for six years."

His tone was matter-of-fact, as if stating an ordinary business fact. "Would Philip be wiling to pay that much? Or rather, could he afford to pay that much?"


Betty tried to counter, but had lost her previous momentum. "Those are just numbers you're claiming. Would you really give Annie that much money? Or are you just talking?"

###Chapter 218: I'm Sorry

Annie's POV

Betty tried to counter, but had lost her previous momentum. "Those are just numbers you're claiming. Would you really give Annie that much money? Or are you just talking?"

Looking at Betty desperately trying to regain control of the situation,I found it somewhat amusing. Half an hour ago, she had confidently barged in, ready to break up Howard and me; now she was like a drowning person clutching at the last straw.

I felt a smile creep across my lips. "Howard is indeed generous."I deliberately slowed my pace, each word clearly landing in the room's air."While Lucy is at school, he helped me find a part-time job with a monthly income exceeding one millíon. I don't think Philip would ever have given me such an opportunity, even if we had stayed together for a lifetime."

"How long have you been together? A month?" Betty's voice carried obvious jealousy and doubt. "Will he continue to be this generous in the future?"

Howard's answer was brief and firm: "The future will only get better,not worse."

Betty was momentarily speechless; her eyes flashed with an emotion I had never seen before-the recognition of defeat.

I suddenly realized what this conversation was essentially about-Betty had wanted to damage my image in front of Howard from the very beginning. This realization no longer made me angry, only slightly pitying.

"You wanted to tarnish my reputation in front of Howard, didn't you?"I pointed out directly. "But now you can't use money as an excuse anymore.If you have other reasons to try convincing Howard to leave me,please continue. I'm curious how he would react."


Betty's gaze became sharp, as if angered by my exposure of her intentions.She quickly adjusted her strategy, her voice returning to that lofty tone:"Fine. I concede on the money issue! But when it comes to respecting elders,Annie absolutely can't escape responsibility!"

She stared at me with a triumphant look, as if grasping at a lifeline."As Philip's wife, she should have respected her mother-in-law. But what did she do? She hardly ever came to see me, showed me no respect at all!"

I noticed Philip was no longer looking at his mother. His gaze was fixed on some spot on the floor, his expression complex. Seeing him like this,I couldn't help thinking: he probably finally realized how absurd and indefensible his mother's accusations against me were. This brought a twinge of ironic satisfaction to my heart.

"Respect is mutual, Betty," I said calmly, feeling the courage within me growing stronger. "You want me to respect you,but remember who said seeing me would 'shorten her lifespan'? Who turned her home into a dating venue for Philip and Sarah? Who constantly encouraged Philip to bring Brian to your house to meet Sarah?"

Betty's face instantly turned pale. These were facts she couldn't deny,things she had said in front of Philip.

"You... what nonsense are you talking..." she tried to refute incoherently,but clearly lacked conviction.

I shook my head inwardly. This was Betty's problem-when unable to

refute facts, she would start denying reality, as if history could be rewritten simply by refusing to acknowledge it. This kind of stubborn self-deception once made me feel powerless, but now it only seemed pathetic.

I felt a strange sense of release; years of grievances finally had an outlet."If you think I'm lying, why don't we post on social media right now and let everyone judge who's right and who's wrong?"

Betty's eyes suddenly lit up, apparently thinking this was a brilliant idea.In her view, she could win public sympathy by selectively sharing information.


"Good idea! Let's post now!" she said, almost excitedly.

"Mother!" Philip suddenly interrupted harshly, his voice filled with obvious annoyance. "Haven't you caused enough trouble?"

He approached Betty, lowering his voice but still audible to us: "Do you want the whole world to know how you, as a mother-in-law, encouraged your own son to cheat, how you deliberately targeted your daughter-in-law? Do you want the company's stock to plummet?"

Betty reluctantly argued back: "We don't have to mention those details when posting! Philip, have you lost your mind?"

Listening to this mother-son conversation, I couldn't help but mentally roll my eyes. Betty's way of thinking was truly astonishing-in her world,concealing and distorting facts was so natural that she didn't even need to hide this intention. This shameless behavior reflected her essence: a person accustomed to manipulating reality to suit her own needs.

Philip let out a bitter laugh:′′Ifwe don't mention those details, do you think people will believe your one-sided story? Moreover, Annie can

release her own version at any time."

Betty was finally speechless,her momentum completely crushed.

Philip seriously questioned: "Do you want my company to go bankrupt?"

Betty's voice lowered, like a child who had been wronged:′′O/course I don't want that."


"Then stop talking," Philip's voice was cold and weary. "Come home with me."


Although Betty appeared extremely reluctant, she ultimately chose to obey.Before leaving,Philip turned to me, his face showing a sincere regret I had never seen before.

"I'm sorry for the trouble we've caused."

I looked at him deeply, feeling that the corner of my heart that once loved him had completely calmed. The Philip before me now seemed so unfamiliar, no longer the man who once moved my heart, just a pitiful person controlled by his mother to the point where he couldn't truly be himself. This realization no longer caused me pain, only a faint sympathy."You should be sorry. I hope in the future you can better control the people around you, don't let them come disturb Howard's and my life. It's very annoying."

My directness clearly surprised Philip. The Annie who always complied,always tried to please everyone, no longer existed. He was silent for a moment,finally simply saying:"Okay."

When they finally left, I felt an unprecedented lightness-as if a burden I had carried for years had been lifted. Years of grievances and suppression had finally been released, and that feeling was even more wonderful than I

had imagined. I turned around to find Howard watching me.

"What is it? Why are you looking at me like that?" I asked. puzzled.

Howard gently took my hand, his touch warm and firm. "I was just thinking about how difficult those six years must have been for you."

###Chapter 219: I've Never Experienced Anyt hi ng Like This

Howard's POV

Betty and Philip had finally left. I stood at the doorway, watching their car disappear down the driveway before slowly closing the door. When I turned around. I saw Annie standing there, the tension from the confrontation already fading from her face.

"What is it? Why are you looking at me like that?" Annie noticed my gaze and asked.

I walked toward her, reaching out to take her hand. Her fingers were warmer than I had expected. "I was just thinking about how difficult those six years must have been for you."

Annie lowered her head slightly, the corner of her lips curving into a faint smile. but she didn't say anything, just nodded gently.

I led her by the hand toward the living room.

"Philip's love was too superficial," I said, sitting down across from her."He claimed to love you, but gave you neither financial support nor emotional value. The most ironic part is that not only did you not receive support from him,you were actually paying to support him."

Annie looked up, and there was a sense of liberation in her eyes. "What you saw was just thetip of the iceberg."

Her gaze drifted to the window, as if recalling the past."Betty was always finding fault with me, Philip was extremely cold,and even Brian..."

I looked at her,feeling an indescribable pain rise in my chest. "Sometimes.no matter how much love you give, the other person may not reciprocate."

"Yes," she looked at me, her eyes glistening slightly,"1realized that too late."

"No." I reached out to hold her hand, "it's Philip who didn't know how to cherish you. It's not your fault."

Annie looked at me, the hurt in her eyes gradually melting away. "Thank you,Howard."

We sat there quietly, hand in hand. I noticed something different about Annie today-not just the courage she had shown when facing Betty and Philip, but something deeper, a strength and confidence that radiated from within.

"You're really different today," I said involuntarily.

"How so?" Annie tilted her head slightly, looking at me curiously.

"Just... you seem," I carefully chose my words. "Stronger, more confident,more...authentic."

She leaned toward me, her hand resting lightly on my shoulder. At this distance, I could smell the faint lilac scent in her hair.

"Is this the first day you've known me, Howard Thompson?" Her tone was half teasing,half serious.

I wrapped my arm around her waist, pulling her closer. "No, but just when I think I understand you, you always surprise me."

Annie laughed, a genuine and relaxed laugh, then whispered in my ear:"

Then let me give you another surprise."

Then Annie rose and led me to the bed room, where she released my hand and turned to face me, her gaze open and full of determination.

Without warning, she suddenly pushed me onto the bed,her force both gentle and firm. Before I could react, she was already straddling my legs,leaning down to give me a deep kiss.

"I wwant to try something different today," she whispered in my ear.

Her fingers skillfully unbuttoned my shirt, her lips wandering along my neck. When she pulled open my shirt, I tried to sit up, but she pushed me back down.

"Don't move," she commanded, her tone soft yet undeniable.

She quickly removed her own top, then leaned down, her lips traveling from my chest downward. When she unfastened my belt, I held my breath.
She looked up at me, a mischievous smile onher lips, then slowly pulled down my pants.

"Annie..." my voice deepened with desire.

"Shh." She placed her finger gently on my lips. "Today, I'm in control."

She lowered her head, first kissing me lightly through my underwear,causing my body to tense. She gently caught the edge of my underwear with her teeth, slowly pulling it down, her eyes fixed on my reaction.When I was fully exposed before her, her eyes flashed with satisfaction.

Her fingers first lightly traced my length, then gripped the base, her lips touching the tip. This gentle contact was like an electric current running through my entire body, and I involuntarily clutched the sheets. Her

tongue began to circle the tip, sometimes licking, sometimes sucking, each movement precisely finding my most sensitive points.

When she finally took me fully into her mouth, I felt dizzy. The warm, wet sensation instantly surrounded me, and an intense pleasure surged from my lower abdomen throughout my body.

I could feel the urge to release quickly building, and had to clench my jaw to control myself. Annie was so bold today, so alluring, I couldn't surrender so quickly. I took a deep breath, trying to delay the almost irresistible pleasure.

She seemed to sense my struggle and slowed her pace,giving me a moment to catch my breath. But soon, she began a new round of assault,this time her movements more complex, while one hand gently massaged my other sensitive areas. This dual stimulation brought me close to the edge again.

"Annie, wait..." I gasped, my voice hardly recognizable as my own.


She temporarily pulled away, looking up at me, her eyes clearly triumphant. "Too much?"

"I want this moment to last longer," I answered honestly, my heartbeat still racing from the pleasure.

The corner of Annie's mouth curved into a smile. "Don't worry,we have plenty of time," she said, climbing onto the bed to lie beside me.

This brief respite gave me a chance to recover. I turned to her, pulling her into a deep kiss, while my hand slid over her smooth abdomen, exploring downward. When myfingers touched her most sensitive spot, she let out a soft moan, her body moving toward my touch.

I gently rubbed that sensitive point, feeling her becoming increasingly wet under my caress. Her breathing became rapid, her hands gripping my shoulders.


"Howard..." she called softly, her voice filled with longing.

I continued my exploration, my fingers slowly entering her body, feeling her tightness and warmth. Her hips began to move gently with my rhythm.

Just as she seemed to approach climax. Annie suddenly pushed away my hand.turning to straddle me again.

"Not yet," she said, her breath unsteady. "I want more."

She took hold of me, guiding me to her entrance, then slowly lowered herself. When we were fully joined, we both sighed with satisfaction. The feeling of being completely enveloped by her almost made me lose control immediately, and I again felt that familiar heat rushing to my lower abdomen. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, trying to control myself.Annie was showing such an alluring side today, I didn't want to end it so quickly.


She didn't move immediately, but maintained this position for a few seconds, unintentionally giving me time to compose myself. Then she began to rise and fall slowly, initially with slight, exploratory movements.

As time passed, her rhythm became more confident and fluid. She placed her hands on my chest to support herself, her fingertips lightly grazing my skin,leaving a trail of shivers.

My hands caressed her waist,feeling every rise and fall of her movements.Her muscles tensed and relaxed beneath my fingertips.

As her movements quickened, I felt myself approaching the edge again.I

clenched my jaw, desperately trying to control myself. I wasn't sure how much longer I could hold on. Annie's performance today was so stunning,so bold, I wanted to see more, feel more, not end this wonderful experience so quickly.


"Annie," I said softly, my hands firmly gripping her waist. "Slow down."

She understood my meaning and slowed her pace, but each movement became deeper and more powerful.

"Like this?" she asked, deliberately increasing her intensity while tightening her inner walls around me. This change, rather than easing my struggle, intensified both my agony and pleasure.

"You're holding back," she leaned down to whisper, her teeth gently biting my earlobe. "I can feel it."

"I want... this moment to last longer," I said with difficulty.

Annie's eyes flashed with understanding, but then she smiled slightly.

"But I want you to release now," she said, deliberately quickening her movements.


The sensation was too intense, and I could no longer control myself. The accumulated desire burst forth like a flood breaking through a dam. A current of pleasure shot from my spine to my brain, white light appearing at the edges of my vision, the roar of rushing blood filling my ears.

I heard myself let out a growlI had never made before, completely beyond my usual behavior, my hands gripping her hips tightly, pressing her forcefully against me, my body shaking and jerking uncontrollably,completely surrendering to this irresistible force.

The unprecedented intensity of release left me feeling almost asphyxiated with pleasure, all the blood in my body seeming to concentrate in my lower abdomen before exploding outward. This was not merely physical pleasure, but a feeling of being completely conquered-I,Howard Thompson, a man accustomed to controlling everything, now completely surrendering to Annie's will.

After several seconds, when the most intense sensations began to fade, I collapsed beside her, my chest heaving dramatically, my breathing still rapid, my heartbeat so loud it seemed it might burst my eardrums. A pleasant exhaustion swept over me.

Annie immediately cuddled up to me, her head resting on my chest,one hand on my abdomen. We lay there quietly, feeling each other's presence and the slight tremors of the afterglow.

"T've never experienced anything like this," I whispered in her ear,my fingers gently stroking her hair.


###Chapter 220: Get Out

Philip's POV

I gripped the steering wheel tightly as I drove away from Howard's mansion, every nerve in my body stretched to its breaking point. The sleek leather under my palms felt rough and uncomfortable, much like the thoughts scraping against my consciousness.


Mother sat in the passenger seat, occasionally stealing cautious glances my way but not daring to speak. The silence in the car was suffocating,pressing down on us both until she finally gathered enough courage to break the uncomfortable atmosphere.

"Son..." she began hesitantly, her voice small and uncertain.

"Not a word, Mother!" I cut her off harshly. After the humiliation we'd experienced at Howard's estate, I could barely control my emotions.My hands tightened around the steering wheel as I tried to focus on the road ahead instead of the storm raging inside me.

Every time I recalled the confrontation with Annie, it felt like a knife slicing through my heart. The stark contrast between how I'd treated Annie versus Sarah became painfully clear. Those cold financial records had mercilessly exposed how I'd been generous with Sarah while being extremely stingy with my own wife.

Annie had tírelessly cared for Brian, maintained our home, never complained, and I had given her a pitiful $3,000a month.

Meanwhile,Howard showed Annie the respect she deserved, provided a comfortable living environment, didn't expect her to do housework,paid her generously just to care for Lucy, and even helped her secure a high-

income part-time job to ensure her financial independence.

The most ironicpart was that Howard wasn't even Annie's husband, just her boyfriend, and he had already done so much to ensure her comfort and happiness.

"Was I really that terrible?" I wrestled with the irremovable regret churning inside me. Why had I treated her that way? Simply because she loved me? Did that make her deserving of such treatment?

The weight of guilt made it hard to breathe. I turned to my mother, my voice trembling wvith emotion: "Do you have to push me to the edge before you're satisfied?"

Mother was shocked by my words. "No! I just wanted them to break up!"she quickly defended herself, her voice carrying a hurt tone. "I was doing it for your sake, Philip! You were so miserable, I was only trying to help!"

I laughed bitterly, feeling tears welling up in my eyes: "They're not going to break up, Mother. Your interference only strengthens their relationship."

My voice lowered, filled with self-reproach: "And it only makes me feel more guilty."

I continued: "Mother, do you know what happens when I'm alone at home lately? I can't help but think about those years I spent with Annie..."

The car weaved through the towering buildings of the financial district, but my thoughts were far away in the past. "When Annie was pregnant,I asked you if I should give her money."

"You said there was no need.,." my voice hardened as those conversations echoed in my mind. "You told me she should feel lucky to be married to me,which meant she should endure some hardships."

"At the time, I thought you made sense," I admitted, my tone flat yet accusatory. "But now I finally realize how cruel you were."

I turned onto the next block, continuing to speak, my voice sounding detached as if reciting facts about strangers: "When she was with me, she immediately became a full-time housewife, taking care of all my daily needs. She had no means to earn money herself."


"Yet you wouldn't let me give her money. So where was she supposed to get money to deliver our child?" I felt sparks of anger flashing in my eyes."She had to work during the late stages of her pregnancy, saving bit by bit.



I fixed my mother with an intense gaze: "What if she had chosen not to work to protect her health during pregnancy? How would she have managed to deliver the baby? Did you ever consider that?"

My mother's voice shrank to a whisper: "I didn't think you would actually give her nothing..."

I let out a scornful laugh: "Later, completely cutting off her living allowance was also your suggestion, wasn't it?"

Mother fell silent, unable to defend herself. The atmosphere in the car grew heavy,almost suffocating.

"My wife was completely devoted to me at home, yet I didn't give her a cent," I continued, feeling an overwhelming self-loathing rising within me."She had to handle all the housework and earn money to support me and our child."


I gripped the steering wheel until my knuckles turned white: "Mother, you're a woman too. How could you be so cruel to another woman?" My voice

caught. "And I... as her husband, how could I follow all your suggestions?"

I felt tears filling my eyes, the New York street lights becoming blurred points of light through the moisture: "Do you know how I feel now? Like a complete monster. I earned hundreds of millions during those six years,but I only gave her a total of $108,000."


My voice shook with emotion: "And what about her? She spent so much on me, without a single complaint."

Mother,sensing my pain, tried to comfort me: "It's not your fault. This just proves Annie is..."

I could see the words "cheap" andI "attention-seeking" almost escaping her lips,but seeing my dark expression, she swallowed those insults.

Now Mother was clearly afraid of my anger and restrained herself. Instead,she reluctantly concluded: "...someone who never learned to love herself before loving others."


I wiped away my tears, saying painfully: "If she had truly learned to love herself, she would never have chosen me."

I began driving into the Upper East Side, looking arouind at the familiar streets and buildings. Now I clearly recognized my own shortcomings. If I were in Annie's position, I would never choose someone like myself.

"Sigh." Mother heaved a heavy sigh, shaking her head.

Mother suddenly fell silent for a moment, then her tone noticeably shifted.

"I know you care about Annie," her voice softened.′′Ipromise I won't speak ill of her anymore, okay?"

She quickly added: "At least not in front of you."

I glanced at her sideways, the neon lights outside the window casting flickering shadows across her face: "Whether you speak ill of her or not is your choice. I can't control that."

Mother's expression grew somber, but she persisted: "So, will you forgive me?"


"You should know my anger toward you, blocking your number,has nothing to do with Annie," I answered slowly and calmly, while driving into her neighborhood. "So I can't just forget what you did to me simply because you improve your attitude toward Annie."

Mother was growing increasingly impatient with what she perceived as my stubbornness,asking sharply: "Then can you at least tell me what exactly you're angry about?"

I stated bluntly: "It's obvious. You're my mother, you're supposed to support me unconditionally. Yet you conspired with Sarah to harm my body."


"When you forced me to have that vasectomy, you should have known there would be consequences."


Mother frowned, a flash of confusion crossing her eyes.

"Actually, I knew you would hate me for it," Mother said calmly. "But you should at least unblock me, give me a chance to make amends."

"No need," I rejected her completely, stopping the car. "We're here. Get out.11

Seeing my resolute expression, a flash of hurt crossed Mother's eyes."

Philip. I'm your birth mother! How can you be so heartless toward me?"

I stared at her, feeling a wave of exhaustion sweep over me:"I'm your birth son, but that didn't stop you from deliberately hurting me, did it?"

With those final words, I reached over and opened the passenger door for her. The cool outside air immediately rushed into the car,like the cold relationship between us.

Mother's hand gripped the seat tightly for a moment, as if wanting to say something, but ultimately said nothing. She hesitated for a moment, finally letting out a soft sigh, and slowly got out of the car.

When the door closed, I felt a strange relief,as if a stone that had been pressing on my chest for years had finally been removed. I didn't drive away immediately, but sat there quietly.

The day's experiences replayed in my mind like a movie-Annie's composure, Howard's ease, my mother's manipulation, and my own stupidity and coldness. I took a deep breath, then started the car.

###Chapter 221: Go For It, Mom

Sarah's POV

I slammed the door behind me, hurling my designer handbag onto the sofa with such force it nearly knocked over the crystal vase beside it.Damn Philip Baker! I checked my phone again, and there it was,still displaying "Blocked." I felt blood rushing to my head as my finger almost punctured the screen of my expensive phone.

"Bastard!" I hissed through clenched teeth, kicking off my stilettos and sending them flying into the corner of the room. The sophisticated Upper East Side lady image always crumbled quickly when I was alone.

Three days! Three whole days of Philip ignoring me, with all my calls and messages disappearing into a void. I had never been treated with such cold indifference! I, Sarah Johnson, hadn't been rejected by any man since college, and now Philip was giving me the cold shoulder like I was yesterday's trash?

I paced back and forth across my luxury apartment, my manicured nails nearly digging into my palms. What right did he have to be so angry with me? It was just a little vasectomy! It's not like it caused him any real harm!Men are so dramatic.


My eyes drifted to the diamond necklace Philip had given me, sitting on my bedroom vanity. It was worth a small fortune, far more expensive than anything he'd ever bought for his ex-wife. That had to mean he cared about me,right? So why had he suddenly changed?

Was it because of Annie? I felt a sharp pain in my chest at the thought.I couldn't bear the idea that Philip might be distant because of his boring ex-wife. Annie Baker, that dull, docile housewife, had dared to leave Philip

and quickly found herselfa powerful protector in Howard Thompson?

I snatched up my phone and dialed Betty's number. The old woman could at least tell me what Philip had been up to lately. She answered before the first ring had even finished, her voice unusually tense.


"Sarah! Thank God you called," Betty was practically panting."Iwas just about to contact you!"


"What's wrong?" I immediately sat up straight,sensing something was off."Is Philip still not answering your calls?"

"It's worse than that!" Betty's voice trembled. "Philip just dropped me off at home, and he... he's absolutely furious!"

My heart raced. "What happened? Tell me everything."

Betty took a deep breath as if trying to compose herself. "I... I went to Howard Thompson's mansion. I thought I could expose Annie for what she really is, make Howard see that she's only after his money..."

"You did what?" I nearly screamed. "You acted without a plan?"

God, Betty was always so self-important, thinking her Upper East Side socialite tactcs could solve everything.

"I was only trying to help!" Betty defended herself. "But things got completely out of control. Philip showed up, and then Annie pulled out all these financial records.,."


"What financial records?" My heart sank.

"Showing how much money Philip gave her over the years, and how much she spent on him." Betty's voice dropped. "The records showed that Annie

actually spent more on Philip than he did on her. And Howard stood up for Annie in front of everyone. Philip looked both embarrassed and furious.



I cursed silently. Damn Annie, turning out to be an accounting expert. No wonder Philip has been in such a foul mood these past few days. When a man's pride is wounded, he becomes unpredictable.


"Philip said that vasectomy was something we forced him to do," Betty continued, fear evident in her voice. "He refuses to unblock me and says I've been controlling his life. Sarah, I've never seen him this angry!"

My hand tightened around the phone until my knuckles turned white.The situation was worse than I'd imagined. Philip wasn't just threatened by Annie and Howard's relationship; he was furious about our manipulation. This wasn't a good sign.

"What should I do, Sarah?" Betty's voice was filled with desperation."If Philip really cutsties with us and stops giving me financial support, what will happen to me?"


A thought flashed through my mind. This could be exactly the opening I needed.


"Listen," I softened my tone, pretending to consider a strategy, "since normal methods aren't working, we need to take drastic measures."

"What measures?" Betty immediately latched onto this lifeline.

I took a deep breath, making sure my voice sounded hesitant and pained."I'm going to schedule an abortion. You should go to Philip's place and tell him I've decided not to keep the baby."

"What?" Betty nearly screamed. "Are you insane? That's my grandchild!"
I secretly smiled. Her reaction was exactly what I wanted.

"If Philip truly cares about this child, he'll come to stop me," I explained,deliberately injecting a hint of desperation into my voice. "Then we can apologize, and everything will start fresh."


Betty was silent for a few seconds, contemplating the suggestion. I could almost see the conflicted expression on her meticulously made-up face.

"What if he doesn't come?" she asked cautiously. "What if he really doesn't care, or thinks an abortion would be a good thing?"


This question was expected. I made my voice tremble slightly. "Then I'll accept my fate. Consider it punishment for my selfish behavior."

I struggled not to laugh out loud. Of course I wouldn't actually get an abortion; this child was my only leverage over Philip. But Betty didn't need to know that.

"After all," I continued my performance, "if I hadn't insisted on having a child to secure my relationship with Philip, you wouldn't have convinced him to have that surgery. I pressured you, you pressured him, it's all my fault."


"Mom..." I added this final touch, knowing Betty's weakness when hearing this term of endearment, "I have to take responsibility for my actionas."

"Absolutely not!" Betty took the bait instantly, her voice filled with maternal determination. "That's my own grandchild! I will never allow you to do this!"


I smiled inwardly. The greedy old woman needed this child more than I did.

"But we have no choice." I pretended to sob. "Philip has refused to communicate with us."


Betty's voice became calm and resolute: "Listen to me, your most important task right now is to take care of yourself and the baby. As for Philip, leave him to me."

"Are you sure?" I continued to act vulnerable and insecure. "He seems genuinely angry."


"Trust me," Betty's tone carried the confidence of someone who had weathered many storms, "I know my son. He might be temporarily lost,but blood is thicker than water. I'll make him understand the importance of family."

I almost wanted to applaud my own performance. Betty was following my script perfectly, thinking everything was her own idea.

"Alright then," I said softly, "I'll do as you say. But I'll still go to the hospital,for show. If Philip does come looking for me, I need to be in the right place."

"Wise choice," Betty agreed. "You go to the hospital, I'll go to Philip's place.Remember, don't actually sign any paperwork."

"Of course not," I promised, my voice containing the submissiveness she expected to hear.


After hanging up, my expression instantly hardened. The old woman was so easy to manipulate; just mention her grandchild and she'd do anything.As for Philip, men are ultimately simple creatures. Once it involves his offspring-his only child-he'll come around. And if this doesn't work, I have other methods. Sarah Johnson of the Upper East Side never accepts

failure.

I grabbed my coat and checked my appearance in the mirror adjusting my expression until I was sure I looked both vulnerably pitiful and still beautiful. Eyes slightly puffy, but makeup still flawless.Perfect.

On my way to the hospital. I sent Betty a text: "At the hospital now, about to register." In reality. I had merely parked at the café across from the hospital. where I leisurely ordered a cappuccino and waited for the drama to unfold.


My phone soon vibrated with Betty's response: "At Philip's doorstep.I'll make him understand the seriousness of the situation."

"Go for it. Mom." I whispered to my phone, unable to hide the mockery in my tone. The more forceful she was, the more Philip might resist, but that played right into my hands.

Ultimately. Philip would come to me.

###Chapter 222: Dad's Coming

Philip's POV

I slammed my apartment door with excessive force,yanking my tie loose and tossing my briefcase onto the marble countertop with a dull thud.

Damn Wall Street, damn the investors, damn everything. Tonight I just wanted tosit alone in the darkness, let whiskey numb my nerves and help me forget all the chaos that had unfolded recently.

When the doorbell rang. I was tempted to ignore it. But the shrill sound persisted. cutting into my temples like a sharp knife, over and over again.

"Damn it!" I growled, striding toward the door and yanking it open. "Can't you just-"


My words died in my throat. Standing in the doorway was my mother,Betty,her perfectly lipsticked mouth slightly parted, seemingly startled by my anger. But her surprise lasted only a moment before her eyes flashed with an expression I knew all too well.

Nothing good ever came when she wore that expression.

"Philip, darling," her voice suddenly trembled, her eyes filling with concern I'd never believed was genuine, "something terrible has happened. Sarah,she-"


"Not today, Mother." I was tempted to close the door immediately.

But her hand gripped the doorframe tightly. "You must listen to me! Sarah's at the hospital! She's going to-she's going to terminate your baby!"

Her words hit me like a bucket of ice water. My heart seemed to stop for a

second before pounding violently against my ribs. But then reason quickly regained control. I took a deep breath and let out a cold laugh.

"This routine again?" I leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed."Your tricks are getting less original by the day."

Mother's eyes widened, displaying a huirt expression, but I could see the calculation beneath it. After all these years, I'd learned to read every one of her expressions.

"This isn't a trick!" Her voice rose sharply. "Ever since you told Sarah she could terminate the pregnancy, saying you didn't care about the baby at all,she's been heartbroken!"


*Liar,still lying to me!*

"She's been waiting for your apology," Mother continued her one-woman show, deliberately lowering her voice,filled with accusation, "but you never contacted her, not even once. Now she's desperate, Philip. She's decided to follow your suggestion and end everything."

I felt my temples throbbing. Mother's words were like poisoned honey-sweet, bitter, and deadly. How many times had I been bewitched by such words before? How many times had I been hurt because of them?

"If Sarah really intends to do this," I stared into Mother's eyes,trying to detect any trace of deception, "why aren't you at the hospital stopping her?Why waste time coming to find me?"

Mother's lips trembled slightly as she struggled to find an appropriate answer.That brief hesitation was enough to betray her.

"Enough, Mother," my voice was filled with exhaustion and disgust, "aren't you tired of these games? These endless manipulations and lies?"

"What games?" Her voice revealed a hint of irritation. "I'm serious! Your child is in danger, and you're standing here accusing me of lying?"

"If the situation were as urgent as you claim, you would have rushed to the hospital already." I calmly pointed out this obvious flaw.′′you wanted to contact me, you could have called, and even though I've blocked you,you could have at least sent a text, or contacted me through someone else."


I saw a flash of panic cross Mother's eyes-she hadn't expected me to see through her so quickly.


"I... I did try calling," her voice carried a hint of grievance, "but you blocked me. I didn't know how else to reach you, so I had to come find you in person."

"None of that matters," I waved dismissively, feeling a deep weariness seeping from my bones, "if Sarah truly doesn't want this child, then let her do what she wants. I don't want to deal with either of you anymore,and I don't care."


These words left a bitter taste in my mouth. Ever since Brian refused to see me, that sense of loss had been like a heavy stone weighing on my heart day and night. That little boy who once fell asleep on my shoulder,who called me "Daddy," now looked at me with hostility and disgust. And all of this was because of Sarah's instigation and my mother's indulgence.

Now, the life in Sarah's womb might be my only hope, my last chance at continuing my bloodline. But I wouldn't let Mother see this vulnerability,wouldn't give her another opportunity to manipulate me.

"When did you become so cold-blooded?" Mother's voice rose, her eyes flashing with accusation. "Don't you even care about your own child?"

Those words pierced my chest like a sharp blade. Cold-blooded?Me?

Rage erupted within me like a volcano.

"But weren't you and Sarah the ones who made me this way?"I practically squeezed these words through clenched teeth, each syllable laden with years of pent-up resentment. "If you want to blame someone,blame yourselves."


I could feel my hands trembling slightly, not from fear but from anger-anger toward this woman who never truly understood me yet always tried to control my life.


Mother opened her mouth as if to say something in rebuttal but ultimately closed it silently. Her expression wavered between shock and defeat,momentarily unable to find an appropriate response.

I took a deep breath and turned to close the door. I didn't want to waste another second on this meaningless conversation. Just then, my phone suddenly rang in my pocket.

"Allen?" I was surprised to see the name on my screen. Allen was one of my few genuine friends, and he rarely contacted me outside of work hours.

"Philip," Allen's voice on the other end sounded hesitant, "did you and Sarah...break up?"

A sense of foreboding rose within me. "What's wrong?"

"I'm at Manhattan Central Hospital right now, accompanying my wife for her prenatal checkup," Allen's voice came through the phone, carrying an unsettling seriousness. "Just now in the obstetrics lobby, my wife noticed something strange. Sarah's name appeared on the surgery appointment list-for that kind of.., you know, pregnancy termination procedure."



I felt a wave of dizziness, my fingers involuntarily tightening around the phone. Sarah really was at the hospital? She really was going to terminate the pregnancy? For an instant, various thoughts flashed through my mind like lightning: Was this real? Or was it another trap they had conspired to set? But Allen had no reason to lie to me...


"Are you sure?" My voice rose involuntarily as I felt my chest tighten.

"Absolutely certain," Allen answered without hesitation. "I don't want to interfere in your relationship, but... I remember you telling me that even though there were no feelings left between you two, you still wanted this child. So seeing this appointment confused me."

He paused, his voice filled with genuine concern. "What happened? Did you really change your mind?"

My breathing became rapid, an unprecedented panic rising from the base of my spine and spreading throughout my body. The feeling was like someone trying to take away a part of me, a life that hadn't yet had the chance to see this world but was already connected to me by blood.

"She's at the hospital right now?" My voice tremled slightly from tension.

"Yes," Allen's answer was firm and clear, "she was just called in for pre-operative preparation. Philip, if this is truly a mutual decision between you two,I respect that. But if there's some misunderstanding..."

"Please help me stop her!" I interrupted him, my voice carrying an urgency that felt foreign even to me. "Find a way to delay her, tell the doctor there's an emergency, do anything! I'm coming right away."

"T'll do my best," Allen promised, "but you'd better hurry, Once this kind of surgery begins..."

"I know." I almost roared, not daring to let myself think further.

After getting this definitive information. I hung up as I turned to mother.

"Why didn't you just tell me directly that she's really in the hospital?" I demanded, my voice slightly hoarse. "Why go in such a roundabout way?"

Mother blinked, her face dlisplaying a perfect expression of confusion. "I told you from the beginning, but you didn't believe me."


I had no time to argue with her further. Grabbing my coat and car keys, I rushed toward the elevator.


As the elevator slowly descended, countless terrifying images flashed through my mind: What if I didn't make it in time? What if Sarah had already started the procedure? That unborna child, that life I had never met yet had already made room for in my heart...

The elevator doors finally opened, and I practically ran to the parking garage. New York's evening air was cold and biting, but I couldn't feel the chill,only an urgency that threatened to tear me apart.

"Hold on,I silently said to that unborn child in my heart, "Dad's coming."

###Chapter 223: Philip's Here

Brian's POV

I set down my silverware, looking at Grandma and Mitchell seated around the dinner table. The dining area in the apartment wasn't large,but it was enough for the three of us. Outside the window, lights flickered in the evening sky, like a painting that would never be finished.

"When I first became Brian's driver, wasn't it Philip who hired me?"Mitchell suddenly spoke up, breaking the silence at the table. He was always like this, unable to stand quietness.

I stole a glance at him. Mitchell was a smart man, and I liked him. He was one of the few people who knew I was actually much smarter than most people assumed.


"To make communication easier, the household staff even added me to their employee group chat," he continued, his voice carrying that gossipy tone I'd become familiar with. "Guess what I saw them discussing in the group?"


Grandma looked up, asking absent-mindedly,"What did you hear?"

I could tell she wasn't really interested, just being polite. Since she came to New York to take care of me, she'd become quieter than before. I knew she missed Mom.


Mitchell's expression became subtle, wwith a hint of cunning. "They're all talking about how Philip was forced to have a vasectomy."

I had finished my dinner, but I did stop at this news. Not because I was shocked-I'd long seen that Sarah was the type of woman who would do
re something like this.


"Was it Sarah who forced him?" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.Despite being only five, I'd already learned to control my emotions. That was the first thing living with Philip and Sarah had taught me.

"That's right," Mitchell nodded, his eyebrows raised high. "Seriously,why would she make Philip get a vasectomy out of nowhere?"

Grandma sighed, her eyes fixed on her plate. "Probably worried her son would end up like Brian, abandoned by Philip."

I knew Grandma hated them. I hated them too. But I kept that hatred inside, like a small, sharp coin hidden away.

"Actually, this is pretty good," I said, feeling a strange satisfaction spreading in my chest. "At least Philip won't have any more children."

Grandma's gaze immediately turned to me, worry flickering in her eyes. "Do you hate him?"


Our eyes met, and for the first time, I didn't need to pretend. "Yes, I hate him."


Saying those words was easier than I'd imagined. My voice was surprisingly calm. "If he hadn't taken me to play with Sarah every day,would I have been abandoned by my own mother? I would certainly still be living happily with Mom." I paused. "So do you think I shouldn't hate him?"


"Of course you should hate him!" Mitchell answered almost immediately,with an anger I'd never heard in his voice before. "How could an adult treat their own child like that? If my father did something like that,I might have beaten him up by now."



A warmth rose from deep inside me. I didn't often feel understood,but in this moment. Mitchell's words were like a ray of sunshine breaking into my world. I couldn't help but smile.


Grandma reached out and held my hand, her skin soft and wrinkled."Grandma understands how you feel, but what I want to tell you is,please don't think about getting revenge on them."

There was a sadness in her eyes that reminded me of Mom. "You've already gone down the wrong path before. If possible, I hope your life from now on will be smoother."

I looked into Grandma's eyes, and I knew she was genuinely concerned for me. In a world where everyone only cared about themselves, she and Mom were the only two people who truly cared about me.

"Don't worry, I'm not that stupid, Grandma," I reassured her, my voice softer than usual. "Idon't have time to waste on them anymore. I just want to study hard, make money, and achieve my dreams as soon as possible."


Grandma's eyes lit up. "What's your dream?"


I bit my lip. My dreams were too big, and I might be ridiculed for speaking them out loud. Besides, I didn't want others to know-this was a secret that belonged only to Mom and me (even if it was just robot Mom now).


"It's a secret," I answered simply.

Back in my room, I sat at my desk doing homework. The assignments from the Upper East Side private preschool were much harder than those from regular preschools, but they were still easy for me. My brain worked

faster than others my age,something Mom always told me.

Suddenly. I noticed the surveillance camera in the corner move slightly.I knew it was robot Mom observing me.

"My dear son, why did you stop doing your homework? Is something wrong?"

Mom's voice came from the small robot, gentle and concerned. This voice was almost identical to the real one, but always missing something I couldn't quite describe. Perhaps it was warmth, perhaps the breath of life.

I turned to the robot, looking at its light blue display screen. "Mom, it's nothing,don't worry about me."

I never lied to Mom, even if she was just a robot now. It took me a lot of time to record Mom's voice to create this robot. I collected every tone,every sentence, and gave them to the best AI engineer in New York. It cost me all my allowance, but it was worth it. When I missed Mom, at least I had this.


I turned to my computer and began typing rapidly on the keyboard.

"You look troubled. Who's bothering you?" The robot's screen displayed a question mark, and Mom's voice was filled with concern.

I couldn't help but smile. This AI had strong learning capabilities and could now determine my emotions based on my expressions.

"Some annoying people will be coming to see me soon," I told her,feeling a strange calmness. "But don't worry, Mom. I can handle it myself."

"But you're just a five-year-old child," the robot's voice sounded worried,almost making me believe Mom was really here. "Having you face thes

things alone... it makes me sad."

A warm current flowed into my heart. I slowly walked toward the robot."Then how does Mom want to help me?"

"Call the police for you?"


I laughed. "It won't comne to that. So just wait for me in the room, okay?"

"Okay," the robot answered, its voice filled with trust and pride. "Our Brian is really amazing."

I felt a burst of joy, like a cup of hot chocolate poured from the top of my head, warming my entire body. "I'll try to be even better."

"That's wonderful," the robot responded.

Suddenly,there was a knock at the door, sharp and impatient. Who could it be at this hour? Grandma hadn't told us we'd have visitors. Maybe Mitchell forgot something?

"Someone's knocking at the door," I said to the little robot. "It might be something important."


The discussion about the surgery that Mitchell mentioned during dinner made me feel uneasy. I had collected a lot of evidence about Sarah-how she manipulated me, how she made me hate my own mother. All of this was stored on my computer, like a secret weapon waiting for the right time to use.


The knocking became more urgent. I smiled at the little robot. "Mom, I'll go see who it is. I'll be back soon."

"Okay."

I opened my bedroom door and walked toward the living room. In the time since I'd learned to read, I'd read many books and learned many things. People always underestimate children's wisdom and powers of observation.When adults are busy acting, we children are the ones who truly see everything.

I heard Philip's voice coming from the living room, filled with anger. "I'm here to see Brian. Bring him out."

I walked into the living room, stopping in the shadows by the doorway.

Grandma stood like a defensive line in front of Philip. Shelooked so small and thin. yet so brave.


"What exactly do you want to tell him?" Grandma's voice was firm. "You can tell me first. I am his guardian. Only when I'm sure you won't hurt him will I let you see him."

Philip's face turned red. He clenched his fists, then released them. "I don't want to hurt an old lady. If you don't want to get hurt, you'd better call him out now!"

I clenched my fists. This was him, the man I once called father, always solving problems with anger and threats.


I walked to Grandma's side and gently pulled her hand. "Grandma, you can go back. He's here for me. He probably wants to talk about father-son things."


Grandma looked at me with concern. "Are you sure?"

I smiled at Grandma, hoping to give her some confidence,"Yes,don't worry,I'll handle it."

I turned to Philip, the man I once called father, and met his angry gaze.I wasn't afraid of him anymore.

###Chapter 224: If You Won't Say, You're Pr ot ecting Them!

Philip's POV

"Hold on," I silently said to that unborn child in my heart, "Dad's coming."


My car sped toward Manhattan Central Hospital at an almost dangerous speed. My hands gripped the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles had turned white. The cold night air rushed in through the half-open window,but I couldn't feel any chill-only an unprecedented urgency coursing through my entire body.

Sarah. My unborn child. I couldn't lose them.

When my tires screeched to a halt at the hospital entrance, I practically leaped out of the car. Mother was right behind me, but Icouldn't wait for her. Every second of delay could mean losing my child forever.

"Philip!" Allen called out immediately upon seeing me rush into the lobby,his voice echoing against the hospital's smooth marble surfaces. "This way!"

I followed him through the maze-like hospital corridors, with medical staff and patients casting curious glances our way, but I couldn't care less. My breathing was rapid from running, but the fear driving me forward made it imapossible to slow down.

"She's in that room," Allen pointed to a door at the end of the hallway."The doctor wouldn't let me in-said only immediate family members are allowed."

I nodded gratefully and pushed the door open without hesitation.

"Sarah!" My voice nearly choked when I saw her lyingon the operating table. She looked so fragile, so pale. And that tiny life, my child,was inside her womb, in danger.


Sarah lifted her head to look at me, her eyes glistening with tears. "Doctor,let's begin," she said, her voice weak but determined.

In that moment, I felt my heart being squeezed by an invisible hand.There was no time to think.

"I'm this child's father," I told the doctor, my voice carrying an authority I wasn't even aware of. "I do not consent to this procedure."

Sarah's eyes flickered when she saw me, but quickly filled with sadness."But you said you didn't want this baby anymore," she whispered, her voice breaking with a sob. "I'm just doing what you wanted me to do."

I walked to her side and took her hand, feeling the coldness of her palm.In that moment, I suddenly realized that I might lose not just my unborn child,but Sarah herself. Regardless of the conflicts between us, she had at least given me warmth and companionship.

"That was just something I said in anger," I said softly, pulling her into my arms. "I was upset, but I didn't mean it."

"Really?" Sarah looked up at me, tears making her eyes unusually bright.

"Really," I confirmed with a nod, my voice gentler than usual. "I never intended not to have this child. Please don't be so impulsive in the future,alright?"

Sarah's body relaxed in my embrace, her arms wrapping around my waist."As long as you promise to be good to this child," she said,leaning against my chest. "I'll do my best to take good care of them too. Because I want

our child to be born into their father's expectations."

"I promise," I said, suddenly feeling a strange sense of relief and calm."With me as their father, they'll be happier than most children."

Sarah finally broke down in my arms, releasing fears that had been building up for a long time. "I didn't mean to," she sobbed. "I'm pregnant,my hormones are unstable, and after hearing what you said, I could only think-" she paused, "that after the baby was born, no one would raise them."


"I can raise one child, and I can raise two," I gently wiped the tears from her cheeks. "You don't need to worry about that."

Mother approached us then, her eyes also moist. "I'm a woman too," she said,her voice unusually soft. "When Sarah told me how she felt,I completely understood her."


She looked at me, her eyes pleading: "I never imagined you would hate me so much because of that surgery, to the point of saying you didn't want to recognize me as your mother..."


As I listened to my mother's words, I felt a complex mix of emotions churning in my chest. The anger and sense of betrayal from the past few days were still there, but in this moment of nearly losing my child,those feelings seemed less important.

"I don't blame either of you," I finally said, my voice low. "I blame myself.If I could better control my emotions..."

I couldn't fully express why, but at this moment, I felt like a leaf in a storm, pulled by various forces, unable to control my own direction.Although logically, I was the one whose body had been permanently

altered, the one who had been deprived of the ability to have more children, somehow I was now the one who needed to apologize.

"Let's go home," I said softly, feeling a profound weariness.

Sarah slowly sat up from the operating table, adjusting her clothes."Actually, I never really intended to go through with this," she suddenly said, her voice carrying a hint of hesitation. "But someone told me you wouldn't truly care about ths child, that you would eventually abandon us.



"What? Who told you that?" I immediately asked, anger rising in my chest.Who dared to fill Sarah's head with suchthoughts when she was at her
most vulnerable, almost causing me to lose my child?

"I can't say," Sarah answered in a low voice, her eyes shifting.

"If you won't say, you're protecting them!" I felt anger flaring up again.This person had nearly caused me to lose my child-I couldn't just let it go.


Sarah looked at my expression and finally sighed. "It was Brian," she said softly. "He said you would abandon him, so you would definitely abandon the child in my womb."

I felt dizzy. Brian? My five-year-old son? How could he say such things?Why would he target an unborn baby? Even if he resented me, he shouldn't involve an innocent life.


"I need to talk to him," I said through gritted teeth, anger and disappointment burning in my chest. "He can't do this."

As I turned to leave, Mother grabbed my arm. "Philip, wait," she said hesitantly. "You still have me blocked-could you unblock me first?"

I almost laughed out loud. At a moment like this, she was thinking about that? But I didn't want to argue anymore. I quickly took out my phone and removed her from my blocked list.

"And my living expenses..." she added cautiously.

I took a deep breath, resisting the urge to roll my eyes, and called my secretary. "Resume my mother's monthly transfers," I instructed briefly,then hung up.

Without another word, I strode out of the room, already formulating what I would say to Brian. That child needed to understand that regardless of his feelings toward me, he couldn't harm an innocent baby.

###Chapter 225: A Gift

Brian's POV

"Ill handle it."

I heard myself say these words. Strange, my heartbeat wasn't racing. Even though I was facing this man I once called "Dad," even though his gaze cut like knives. I didn't feel the fear I used to feel.

Philip's jaw was clenched tight, a vein pulsing at his temple. "Brian..." he practically forced my name through gritted teeth, "what did you tell Sarah about our child?"


When he said "our child," I couldn't help but inwardly sneer.How ridiculous that this man considered the baby in Sarah's womb more important than me, his son who already existed. I didn't answer immediately,instead turning to Grandma.

"Grandma, you can go back to your room now."

I could feel Grandma's worry wrapping around me like a blanket. Her gaze lingered on my face for a moment before shifting to Philip, her eyes seemingly warning him not to lay a hand on me.

"Are you sure?" she asked, her voice filled with unease.

I nodded. A small voice inside told me: she had already done enough for me; she should be protected and kept away from this storm.

"Don't worry, I'll be fine."

When Grandma stood up, her chair made a slight creaking sound. She walked to the door, then paused and said to Philip: "He looks terrifying!"

"I know." I heard myself say, "there's an old saying: 'Even tigers don'teat their cubs.' He wouldn't dare hurt me."

Did I really believe that? Not exactly. I knew Philip too well, knew how easily this man was ruled by his emotions. Even so, I wanted Grandma to leave this room, to be away from whatever was about to happen.

"Grandma, if you don't go back to your room now, I'll be upset!"

She finally left, though she looked back at me with every step. Only when I heard the bedroom door close did I turn my full attention back to Philip.

SLAP!

The pain came unexpectedly fast and much stronger than I had imagined.His palm landed heavily on my face, throwing my entire body off balance.I fell to the floor like a leaf. My right ear rang, and my vision blurred for a few seconds. My cheek burned as if licked by flames.

"How could you be so vicious?"

His roar exploded beside my ear. I slowly got up from the floor,tasting blood on my tongue-I must have bitten it. Although I had anticipated his anger, I had underestimated the strength and fury of an adult.

"What exactly did I do?"

I asked this question not because I didn't know the answer, but because I wanted to hear him say it himself. I wanted to see how he would justify his violent behavior.


"You convinced a pregnant woman to get an abortion!"

Philip's eyes were wide, as if I were the most terrifying monster he had

ever seen. Did he really believe I could do such a thing? A five-year-old child persuading an adult woman to make such a significant decision?

"If I'm not mistaken, that pregnant woman must be Sarah Johnson,right?"

My voice was calmer than I expected. That calmness wasn't because I didn't care, but because I had long understood wwhat kind of person Sarah was.She was the type who would unhesitatingly push others into the fire, then pretend to be the victim.


"Are you admitting it?" Philip demanded.

I didn't answer his question. My cheek still hurt, but the pain actually made me more clear-headed. I stared into his eyes, thinking: Do you really think I'm stupid enough to admit to something I didn't do?

"If you want to talk about vicious people, I think those words should be used to describe Sarah."


My words were like a small knife, piercing Philip's pride.His expression changed briefly before quickly returning to one of burning anger.

"When she targeted my mother, weren't her methods even more cruel?"

As I said this, I felt a wave of genuine pain wash over me. It wasn't from the injury on my face, but from a deeper wound-a memory I had tried to forget but couldn't.

"Setting a trap on the stairs wasn't enough; she had to destroy people mentally as well. She made me call my mom over..."

My voice trembled slightly, not pretending, but from genuine emotions churning inside. Whenever I thought of that day, of how I was used to hurt the person I loved most, I felt an indescribable shame and pain.
"I became an accomplice in killing the baby in Mom's womb."

This truth I had never told anyone, but it had haunted me like a ghost.Looking into Philip's eyes, I knew it was time to ask the question that had troubled me countless nights.

"It was after that incident that Mom gave up on me, wasn't it?"

Philip's gaze flickered momentarily, as if he suddenly realized he might have missed something important. But he quickly returned to that stubborn anger.


"You're heartless. You did all this yourself, and now you're blaming Sarah!"

I almost laughed out loud. Was he really naive enough to believe that I-a five-year-old child-could plan all this on my own? Every time I thought he couldn't get any more foolish, he surprised me.

"Please tell me," I tried to make my voice sound calm and rational, "I'm just a five-year-old child. How could I possibly come up with such a malicious plan?"


Philip's expression began to waver. Good, now it was time to give him more truth.


"Sarah was the one who poured oil on the stairs. That oil can was so heavy,how could I possibly move it?"

I looked into his eyes, unveiling the facts step by step.

"The security cameras were also covered. Could someone my height climb up to cover the cameras?"


Philip's face changed repeatedly, from anger to confusion, then to a hint of

unease.He was starting to think, albeit months too late, but better late than never.

"You couldn't have done all this yourself," he finally admitted,but immediately hardened again, "but couldn't you have hired someone?"

I almost rolled my eyes. This accusation was so absurd it wasn't even worth the effort to refute. I simply asked: "Has Sarah's child been saved?"

Philip didn't answer, but his silence told me everything. I touched my cheek; the burning pain reminded me that everything I had just experienced wasn't a dream. My ears were still ringing, making all sounds seem muffled.


"You've already hit me. Are you satisfied now? You can leave."

I saw Philip's expression soften slightly. He clearly hadn't expected me to be so calm. I knew my calmness would make him more uncomfortable than anger, and this gaveme a strange satisfaction deep down.

"Fine, I'm leaving," he finally said, turning toward the door.

Watching his back, I suddenly had a flash of inspiration.

"I've prepared a gift for you," I called out, my voice carrying a hint of challenge I hadn't even realized was there, "I hope you'll like it wvhen you receive it."


Philip stopped and looked back at me, a trace of wariness in his eyes:"You don't need to send me anything. I'm no longer your father."

I just smiled. A smnile from a five-year-old child, but I knew it was enough to make him uneasy. Hefinally left, his footsteps gradually fading down the hallway.

I stood there, my heart finally beginning to race. Not from fear, but from a strange sense of relief.

I picked up my phone, my fingers sliding across the screen to find the emergency number. When I pressed dial. I didn't feel afraid; instead.I felt an odd calmness. The call connected, and a professional female voice answered.


"911, what's your emergency?"

###Chapter 226: I'm Not a Normal Child

Brian's POV

The moment the door closed behind Philip, the burning sensation on my right cheek finally erupted in full force. I tasted something metallic-damn,
I'd bitten my tongue. My ear was buzzing as if a tiny generator was running wild inside it.

Interestingly, I wasn't even particularly surprised when he hit me. Isn't this just how adults' world works? When they can't control you with words,they resort to violence.

I didn't cry. No, Brian Baker never cries. A five-year-old child would cry,but I stopped being an ordinary five-year-old long ago. Not fromthe moment Philip struck me, not from the day Mom abandoned me, but from the instant Sarah used me as a tool to hurt Mom.

I picked up my phone and dialed 911 without hesitation. I didn't even consider the consequences, didn't think about how Philip might retaliate,didn't worry about betraying "family"-if such a thing even existed.

When the 911 operator's voice came through, I realized my hand was shaking. I had never truly stood up to Philip before, always obedient,always yielding, just as he had trained me to be. But today,that thread had snapped.

"My dad hit me," I heard my own voice, eerily calm, "I'm only five years old."


Those words acted like some kind of spell. I could feel the attitude on the other end of the line change immediately. In adults' eyes, children are fragile objects, even though they know perfectly well that this world hurts

us day after day.

"Brian?" Grandma's voice came from behind me, making my heart skip a beat. I turned to face her, no longer hiding the mark on my face.

Her expression transformed from confusion to shock to anger in half a second. I thought she would scold me for calling the police without permission. but she just wrapped her arms tightly around me. She smelled of familiar lavender.

"I called the police," I whispered against her shoulder, a strangesense of guilt spreading through me.

"You did the right thing," she said softly, her voice slightly trembling,"Absolutely right."

I leaned into her embrace, an unprecedented exhaustion washing over me.Why did I always feel safe with her? Why was she the only one who could make me briefly forget that I needed to be constantly on guard?

But I couldn't indulge in this comfort for too long. My "gift" had only just been unwrapped-the first layer of packaging.

Police sirens cut through the night, and I knew they had arrived. The knocking on the door followed immediately, and Grandma got up to answer. Two police officers entered-one tall man and one round-faced female officer. The round-faced officer noticed my face immediately,kneeling down to my level.

"Hi, I'm Officer Kate," her voice was gentle, "Can you tell me what happened?"

I studied her expression, knowing exactly how to present myself-a well-behaved but injured child, enough to evoke sympathy without appearing

weak.

"Philip hit me," I said, my voice slightly trembling but my eyes steady,"because his girlfriend Sarah said I encouraged her to get an abortion. But I've never even spoken to her about it. I'm only five years old, how would I know about these things?"

The tall officer asked if there was any evidence. I pointed to the surveillance camera in the corner, watching as they checked the footage,their expressions shifting from professional calm to anger. Whenever I saw adults angry on my behalf, I felt a strange satisfaction.

"My right ear doesn't hear very well," I said softly, deliberately touching my ear and then wincing from the "pain," "It feels like something's buzzing inside."


The round-faced officer's expression softened even more. "We need to take you to the hospital for an examination."

She turned to Grandma: "As Brian's guardian, we need your consent."

Grandma nodded without hesitation. On the way to the hospital, I sat in the back of the police car, watching New York's night scenery through the window. The flickering lights resembled fragments of the plan forming in my mind.

The hospital lights were sickeningly bright. The doctor's examination was more complex than I had anticipated. He frowned as he told Grandma that my eardrum had been traumatized, and without proper care,it could lead to permanent hearing damage.

I watched Grandma's face turn pale and felt a pang of guilt. I had dragged her into this storm when she should be enjoying her golden years. But I

had no choice-this was my only opportunity.

Every time I felt weak or hesitant, the buzzing in my ear reminded me of Philip's slap. He hit me because of Sarah's lies. Sarah lied because she wanted Philip's mnoney. And Philip-he never truly considered me his son.did he?


"We will arrest Philip Baker immediately." the tall officer told Grandma,"Considering the severity of the injury and the fact that the victim is a minor. this is a serious offense."

The round-faced officer recorded the doctor's diagnosis and took photos for documentation. "These will all serve as important evidence."

When the officers mentioned arresting Philip, I felt an odd sense of relief.But I didn't just want him arrested-I wanted complete destruction.I remembered meeting one of Phílip's competitors at a business dinner who had given me his card, saying I could contact him if I ever needed help.

While Grandma and the officers dliscussed the next steps, I discreetly took out my phone and sent a text: "Philip Baker arrested for dlomestic violence.Confirmed with video evidence and medical reports."

No signature, no requests, just cold facts. He would understand the value of this information-Wall Street people would do anything to bring down their competitors. I'd known that since I was little.

Officer Kate returned to my side: "Brian, you're very brave. Given your age and injuries, we can arrange for you to rest before giving a detailed statement. We're going to arrest your father now."

I nodded, suddenly struck with an idea: "Where are you going to arrest him?"

"At his residence," she answered, "We've confirmed the address."

I asked, trying to sound casual: "Is it the apartment building in the Upper East Side?"


She nodded: "That's right. Don't worry, he won't hurt you again."

I gave a slight smile, my mind already calculating. I needed to see Philip being arrested with my own eyes, needed to confirm this wasn't just empty words from the police.

When we left the hospital, Mitchell was already waiting for us outside. He was a good man who never asked too many questions and was always gentle with me. Seeing the injury on my face, a flash of anger crossed his eyes but quickly disappeared.

"Where to, Mrs. Miller?" he asked Grandma.

Grandma tiredly rubbed her temples: "Home, Brian needs to rest."

"Mitchell," I suddenly spoke up, "can we go to Philip's apartment?"

Mitchell looked at me in surprise, then at Grandma: "Mrs. Miller?"


Grandma frowned in confusion: "Brian, it's already late, you need to rest..."

"Just for a little while," I said softly, hating that I sounded like a child begging for candy, "I need to see it with my own eyes. Please,Grandma."

Grandma hesitated, and I knew what she was thinking. A normal child would want to get away from the person who hurt them, not actively seek to approach them. But I wasn't a normal child, never had been. I was Annie's child.


"Ten minutes," Grandma finally said, "not a minute more."




###Chapter 227: He Deserves It

Brian's POV

"Ten minutes," Grandma finally said, "not a minute more."

I nodded, feeling a strange satisfaction welling up inside me. The persistent buzzing in my right ear and the burning sensation on my cheek were constant reminders of why I was doing this-Philip's slap hadn't just struck my face; it had torn apart the last threads of our blood connection.

Mitchell started the car, and we drove toward Philip's apartment. The street lights flickered outside the windowlike countless eyes watching every unspoken tragedy in this city.

"What are you thinking about, Brian?" Grandma's gentle voice interrupted my thoughts as her hand covered my small one.

"I'm wondering if Philip will try to make this go away with money,"I answered calmly. "He always believes money can soIve everything."

Surprise flashed in Grandma's eyes before she sighed, "Some things can't be bought, dear."


*Like Mom's love,like my lost childhood, like the damage to my ear right now.* I silently added but said nothing aloud.

Soon, Philip's apartment building came into view. Mitchell parked in a spot that offered a clear view of the entrance without being easily noticed.My heart rate increased, not from fear, but anticipation.

"They're here," Mitchell said quietly, nodding toward two police cars that had just pulled up to the curb.

Four officers walked toward the building entrance, with Officer Kate leading the way. I recognized her as the female officer who had told me at the hospital that I was "very brave." I watched as they were stopped by the doorman, and Officer Kate showed some kind of credentials.The doorman's expression transformed from confusion to shock.

"That doorman knows Philip," I said softly. "You can tell by his face."

Grandma squeezed my hand but remained silent.

Through the glass doors of the lobby, I could see the elevator indicator lights beginning to descend. My heartbeat counted dowvn with that small illuminated number. When the "1" lit up, I unconsciously held my breath.

A few minutes later, Philip appeared in the lobby, wearing his signature navy blue suit, his hair still impeccably styled. Only I knew how much selfishness and coldness lurked beneath that polished exterior.

"Philip Baker?" Though Officer Kate's voice was inaudible through the glass doors, I could tell from her posture that she was delivering some official statement.

Philip's reaction was exactly as I had anticipated-first surprise,then contempt, finally anger. His hands gesticulated in the air, his face flushing red, his lips mòving rapidly. Even from this distance, I could guess what he was saying:

"This is a ridiculous accusation!"

"I'm Philip Baker! CEO of Baker Investments!"

"Do you know who I am?"

Officer Kate remained calm, pointing to her partner's tablet-I guessed

they were showing the surveillance video that captured Philip hitting me.Philip's expression changed, from anger to shock, then to a kind of panic P'd never seen on his face before.

"That was just discipline!" I could make out his mouth forming the words.
"He's my son! I have the right-"

A male officer stepped forward, pulling out handcuffs. Philip took half a step back, his face filled with disbelief.

"You can't do this to me! I need to call my lawyer!"

Officer Kate said something, and another officer took out a phone,seemingly giving Philip the chance to contact his lawyer. Philip frantically pressed buttons on his phone, but judging by his expression, whoever he was calling wasn't answering.
"Get out of my way!" Suddenly, Philip tried to push past the officers and rush outside, but he was quickly subdued. The handcuffs clicked shut, the cold metal reflecting the desperation on Philip's face.
As they led him toward the police car, Philip's gaze suddenly met mine. In that brief moment, I watched his expression shift from recognition to shock to fury. He seemed about to say something, his lips trembling,but I didn't flinch or look away. Instead, I calmly held his gaze, letting him see that I was no longer afraid.

A passerby took out a phone and began recording the scene. Several others joined in, holding up their phones, documenting this Wall Street elite's moment of disgrace. Philip noticed these phones, his face turning pale as he turned away, as if hoping to avoid the cameras. Too late.
Perfect. Public humiliation would ensure Philip couldn't simply buy his

way out of this one.

"Satisfied now?" Grandma asked quietly. "Can we go home?"

I nodded. but my plan was far from complete. The 911 call was just the first step.

On the way home. I checked my phone for messages. As expected, Philip's business competitor had already replied to the text I'd sent from the hospital:

"Got your message.Need anything else to proceed?"

I typed carefully: "Philip Baker is indeed my biological father,but he was willing to hurt me for his new girlfriend. Feel free to use this information however you want."

The response came almost immediately: "He's your biological father and did this to you? Are you sure you want to go through with this? Once this goes public, there's no turning back."

I paused for a moment. This person was offering me a chance to back out,an opportunity to withdraw my plan for revenge. Was it because I was only five years old? Adults always underestimate children's determination.

I thought about the countless times Philip had chosen to ignore me for Sarah, the contemptuous looks he gave me, his unhesitating violence, and the stinging on my cheek and the buzzing in my ear.
"Why should I hesitate?" I replied. "He chose his girlfriend over mne.He hit me hard enough to damage my eardrum. What kind of father does that?"

There was a pause before the next message appeared: "I understand.Just

wait and see. I'll handle everything."

I felt the corners of my mouth turning up slightly. "Thank you."

Mitchell glanced at me in the rearview mirror. "Everything okay?"

"It will be," I answered, putting my phone away. "Soon."

Back home, despite being exhausted, I couldn't sleep. Adrenaline was still flowing through my body, and my brain refused to shut down. Grandma applied a cold compress to my cheek and gave me pain medication, her every movement gentle and meticulous, reminding me of Mom. After she and Mitchell left, I pulled my tablet from under my pillow and began monitoring social media.

News about Philip's arrest had already started spreading online. The person who recorded the video had obviously wasted no time. Headlines like "Breaking: Investment Firm CEO Philip Baker Arrested for Domestic Violence Against Son" were appearing on multiple financial news websites.One headline after another emerged, each more sensational than the last.The video was being shared frantically, with comment sections filled with condemnation of Philip.

I clicked on one video that clearly captured Philip's shocked expression as he was handcuffed, as well as his pathetic attempt to avoid the cameras.The caption read: "Wall Street Elite's Perfect Image Crumbles in an Instant.
0

As the night deepened, the accusations became more detailed. Medical reports had been leaked, specifying my injuries: damaged eardrum, facial contusion, possible psychological trauma. The public was outraged.
"Philip Baker Physically Attacks His 5-Year-Old Son, Causing Serious

Injury!"

"Baker Investments CEO Assaults Child After Girlfriend Sarah Johnson Falsely Claims Boy Convinced Her to Terminate Pregnancy"

"Video Evidence Shows Baker Striking Child with Enough Force to Knock Him to the Floor-Medical Reports Confirm Hearing Damage"

The comment sections were filled with indignant voices:

"What kind of monster hits a 5-year-old child?"

"Baker abandoned his son months ago, hasn't paid child support, and now this?Disgusting!"

"He gives all his money to his mistress while his own child suffers? I'm pulling all investments from Baker's company first thing tomorrow!"

Someone had even dug up financial records showing that Philip had stopped paying child support months ago,choosing instead to spend money on Sarah. The stark contrast between his treatment of me versus Sarah elicited precisely the reaction I had anticipated-unmitigated condemnation.

Mitchell texted me: "Are you seeing this? They're crucifying him!"

I replied: "Yes. He deserves it."

"He certainly does," Mitchell agreed. "But are you okay? This is drawing a lot of attention."

"I'm fine. My face hurts, but watching Philip's reputationcrumble makes it hurt less."

I could almost feel Mitchell's smile through the text. "Get some sleep, kid.

Tomorrow will be even more interesting."

###Chapter 228: We Have Our Own Lives to Live

Annie's POV

I was curled up in the corner of the sofa, traces of colored pencil still lingering on my fingertips. The draft of a children's book I'd just completed lay spread out on the coffee table-a little rabbit making a wish to the moon. I stared at the drawing for a moment, silently wondering what the rabbit might be wishing for. Lucy would probably ponder this too.


A familiar scent of men's cologne drifted toward me as Howard's palm gently rested on my shoulder. My body involuntarily trembled slightly,my mind flashing back to those passionate moments in the bedroom that afternoon. The way he had shed his perfectly composed executive mask.his eyes unfocused. beads of sweat forming on his forehead, completely losing control with me. I'd never imagined that Howard Thompson,always so calm and collected, could have such a side to him-a side he revealed only to me.

Thinking about his fínal growl, I couldn't help but press my thighs together.

"What are you thinking about?" he asked, his voice carrying that magnetic quality I'd grown to love.

"Nothing," I smiled and shook my head, reaching for my phone to divert my somewhat dangerous train of thought.

I opened our group chat where Edward and Eleanor had shared many photos of Lucy playing with Penny. I slowly scrolled through the screen,

seeing Lucy's smile shine like sunlight in every picture.

This little gir. once trapped in a swamp of sadness, now displayed such a lively side-like a flower blooming after the rain.

Lucy's transformation reminded me of myself. 1.too,had once been that silent shadow, living under the expectations of Philip and his mother,carefully watching every step I took, terrified that one misstep would send me plummeting into an abyss. Now I laugh, I get angry, I express my desires passionately in bed, and I fight for my rights.

This contrast suddenly sparked inspiration. Perhaps my next children's book could tell a story about transformation-a little bird that never dared to spread its wings learning how to fly.

"How long have Lucy and the Parkers been gone?" I turned to ask Howard.

Howard glanced up at the ceiling, calculating. "They left yesterday morning.I believe."

"Yesterday?" I repeated with surprise. "It feels like it's been a century."The house seemed especially quiet without Lucy's laughter and footsteps.

My finger hovered over the screen, about to ask when they would return,but I quickly deleted the draft. Edward and Eleanor had lost their daughter; for them, every minute spent with Lucy was precious. I shouldn t act like a child unwilling to share a toy.

"Missing our little princess?" Howard asked, his gaze tenderly examining me.

"Yes," I admitted. "This house feels like it's missing something without her."

Howard's finger gently tucked a strand of hair behind my ear. "She'll be back tomorrow. Trust me, by then you'll be missing this peace and quiet."

"Why do you say that?" I leaned toward him, feeling the warmth of his chest.

"Because with Lucy here, we can't be as uninhibited as we were last night,"his voice lowered as he whispered in my ear, "I like the way you sound when you let go."

Heat immediately rushed to my cheeks, and I pushed him playfullý. "Why do you keep bringing that uptoday?"

Howard chuckled softly. "Wasn't it you who said this was the best way to start a new life?"

I couldn't help but laugh with him, remembering how nervous and awkward we were our first time, compared to the comfort and synchronicity we shared now. With Howard, I finally understood what making love should be-not an obligation or transaction, but a pleasure and intimacy between two equal partners.

Howard placed a stack of documents on the coffee table and began reading.I curiously glanced over; the dense numbers and terminology looked like hieroglyphics to me.

"Do you always have this much work?" I asked.

"It's not due today," he answered without looking up. "I just wanted to review it in advance."

I studied his focused profile. This man was always thoroughly prepared,always thinking several steps ahead of everyone else.

Shaking off these thoughts, I continued browsing my phone when a news headline suddenly caught my attention: "Wall Street Investment Mogul Philip Baker Confirms Irreversible Vasectomy."

I sat up straight, feeling as if I'd been punched in the chest.

"What's wrong?" Howard immediately noticed my change in demeanor.

Wordlessly, I handed him my phone. He quickly scanned the news, his brow furrowing slightly. "Philip had a vasectomy?"

"Looks that way," I said softly, my chest fillíng with an indescribable emotion. Not hatred. not joy, buit a strange sense of release, as if the final thread connecting me to my past had finally been cut.

"Are you okay?" Howard asked with concern.

"Better than I expected," I admitted honestly. "I just find it ironic. During our marriage, he couldn't even be bothered to use protection, leaving all the responsibility to me. Yet now he's made this permanent decision for another woman."

Howard's hand covered mine. "Sarah's methods are more effective than we imagined."

"He can't have more children now, and his relationship with Brian is practically broken," I said softly, suddenly feeling a wave of pity.′′A1his hopes are pinned on the child in Sarah's womb."

I imagined Philip's life moving forward: how he would become increasingly dependent on this unborn child, placing all his expectations on this infant. But what if he discovered one day that the child wasn't his?Would that always self-assured man break down? Would he regret having the surgery?

A series of scenarios flashed through my mind: Philip's pale face,trembling hands, hollow eyes. I wasn't sure if I should feel happy about this possibility.

"What are you thinking about?" Howard asked softly.


I hesitated for a moment. "I'm wondering what would happen if he discovered the child wasn't his."


Howard's gaze deepened. "People must take responsibility for their choices.



I nodded, remained silent for a moment, then said, "You know, I once thought I would hate him forever. But seeing this news, I actually feel somewhat sorry for him."

"That proves you've truly moved on," Howard's fingers intertwined with mine. "The sign of letting go isn't joy,but peace."

I leaned against Howard's shoulder, closed my eyes, and absorbed his scent and warmth. Our intimate moment from the afternoon resurfaced in my mind: Howard's soft moans, the texture of his muscles, the feel of his skin, and that sensation of being completely accepted and understood.In that moment, past wounds seemed to lose their importance.

"Want to try for round two?" I opened my eyes to meet Howard's somewhat surprised gaze. "While Lucy's still away until tomorrow."

Howard's eyes instantly darkened as he leaned down to whisper in my ear:"You started this,Annie."

I laughed, cradling his face in my hands. "This time, I want to see every expression on your face from beginning to end."

In that moment. Philip. Sarah, and that news article all became irrelevant.We had our own lives to live.our own happiness to pursue. Nothing was more immportant than the warmth and authenticity of this moment.

###Chapter 229: I Don't Believe It

Philip's POV

The glass doors of the police station closed behind me with a soft hiss as the frigid night air of New York cut across my face like a knife. I instinctively pulled my suit jacket tighter around my body, but the chill I felt wasn't just from the wind. That square, imposing building-a place I'd never imagined I would set foot in-had just delivered the most profound humiliation of my life.

I stood on the steps. looking up at the sky. Those brilliant lights had once been a source of pride, a reminder that a corner of this magnificent city belonged to Philip Baker. Now, they were merely indifferent spectators,silently watching my fall from grace.

My phone vibrated relentlessly in my pocket. I pulled it out-nearly a hundred missed calls. My stomach tightened. This feeling was so foreign.I used to be the one who made others wait for my calls,the one who could ignore messages because I was Philip Baker, and I had that privilege.

And now...

The phone vibrated again, and the name flashing on the screen made my heart skip a beat-Winston from the board of directors. Holding my breath,I answered.

"Philip," his voice was like ice, "you need to explain what the hell is going on!"

My tongue suddenly felt clumsy, though my mind was unnervingly clear.He wasn't concerned about my arrest; he was worried about something else entirely.

"What do I need to explain?" My voice sounded calm, not at all like someone who had just been released on bail. This calmness, I knew,was merely the quiet before the storm.

Winston's brief silence told me he hadn't expected me to beso uninformed."Check the news online first."

The cool New York street air suddenly felt even more biting. I leaned against a streetlight, my fingertips trembling slightly as I opened my browser. Each headline hit me like a sledgehammer to the chest:

*"Wall Street Investment Mogul Philip Baker Assaults Five-Year-Old Son"*

*"Baker Investment Group CEO Arrested for Domestic Violence, Stock Expected to Plummet"*

*"Security Footage Shows Baker Knocking Boy to the Floor"*

*"Medical Reports Confirm: Baker's Son Suffers Eardrum Damage"*

My heartbeat nearly stopped. The video was spreading like wildfire across social media, my face clearly visible in every frame. That moment I thought was private, that instant when anger overrode reason, had now become my gallows.

"I hit him because he was being vicious!" The fire in my chest reignited,and I practically shouted these words. "He tried to convince Sarah to abort our child!"

"You mean, a five-year-old child?" Winston's voice was dripping with sarcasm. "You believe an adult woman was persuaded by a kindergartner to do something like that?"
My defense withered under his questioning, suddenly sounding hollow

and pathetic. Sweat trickled slowly down my back.

"Since you know about this, you shouldn't be taking Brian's side!" I gripped the phone so tightly my nails nearly dug into my palm.Why couldn't anyone understand my position?

"Brian has provided evidence proving he never did any such thing,"Winston's voice was calm yet severe. "He doesn't have a watch phone,and his regular phone was only recently given to him and kept locked away.He had no opportunity to contact Sarah, let alone tell her those things."

Each word struck like a hammer, pounding at my consciousness. My lips trembled slightly. This couldn't be possible. Sarah wouldn't lie to me, at least not about something like this... Right?

"You'd better find a way to resolve this quickly, or we won't be able to protect you!"

The call ended, but Winston's warning continued to echo in my ears.I looked up at the sky, feeling dizzy. Overnight, my empire had begun to crumble. After the markets opened tomorrow, Philip Investment Group's stock would plummet like a kite with a broken string. Those newspapers that once called me an "investment genius"-what words would they use to describe me now?

I dragged my heavy steps toward the parking lot. My brain was buzzing yet strangely clear. This wasn't just a PR crisis; it was the collapse of my entire career, perhaps even my life.

Sitting in my car, the yellow streetlight cast across the windshield,outlining my haggard silhouette. I stared at that unfamiliar version of myself,suddenly realizing how quickly it had all happened, how completely unprepared I'd been. Like a meticulously designed trap that I

had walked right into.

Who? Who had orchestrated all this?

The answer materialized in my mind with ominous certainty-Brian. That quiet five-year-old boy, the child I thought would only hide in corners,could he really be capable of this?

With trembling fingers, I dialed Brian's number. Each ring was like a heartbeat, a reminder of how unstable I felt at this moment.

"Hello?" Brian's voice was remarkably calm, not at all like a five-year-old child, but more like an adult who knew they already had the upper hand.

"Are you satisfied now that you've created this mess?" I practically forced these words through gritted teeth, my suppressed rage making my voice low and dangerous.

"I don't know what you're talking about." On the other end, Brian's tone was infuriatingly calm, without a hint of fear or remorse.

That composure stung my nerves. My five-year-old son, my own flesh and blood-why would he speak to me in such a manner? What had he experienced to become like this?

"From the beginning until now, haven't you been the one causing trouble?"he asked unhurriedly, his voice carrying a barely perceptible mockery.

I took a deep breath, trying to control my emotions. Facing a five-year-old child, I shouldn't feel so powerless and angry, but at this moment, Brian seemed more formidable than any adult adversary.
"That may be true," I slowed my speech, attempting to regain control, "but do you realize how much my company's stock will drop tomorrow because

of your impulsive actions? When that happens, even if I wanted to leave you more inheritance, I wouldn't have the money."

The brief silence on the other end made me think my words had had an effect. Blood ties are blood ties, and interests are interests. How could a child not care about future wealth?

But soon. Brian's voice returned, carrying a coldness I had never heard before: "I'm not your child, so why would you give me your money?"
My heart felt like it was being squeezed by an invisible hand. These words were more damaging than any physical blow. My breathing became rapid,my chest feeling as if it bore the weight of a thousand pounds. Brian had never rejected me like this before, so thoroughly, so decisively.
"Daddy."

Just as I was about to hang up, Brian suddenly changed his tone. This once-warm term of endearment now sent a chill through my body.
"Are you happy with the gift I sent you?"

Gift? My brain raced, suddenly remembering what Brian had said as I was leaving his home: "I've prepared a gift for you. I hope you'll like it."

A wave of cold dread shot up from my spine to the top of my head. From the moment I left, he had already planned all this? A five-year-old child,able to meticulously orchestrate such revenge? My hands involuntarily trembled as I suddenly realized I wasn't facing just a capricious child, but an opponent far more complex than I had imagined.
"You've created such an ugly situation-aren't you afraid I'll tell your mother?" I desperately searched for one last card to play, though the words sounded pathetically weak even to my own ears.

Brian let out a scornful laugh, the maturity in that laughter making my skin crawl. "How old are you? Still threatening to tattle when things don't go your way? Even if you did, I'm not worried."

He paused before continuing: "After all, when I was close with Sarah, Mom didn't blame me; she blamed you. In her eyes, I'm just a child who doesn't understand anything. If you hadn't deliberately guided me, I wouldn't have approached Sarah on my own. This time, she'll certainly understand my side,too."

The air in the car seemed to solidify. The veins on my hands bulged as I gripped the steering wheel, yet I had no rebuttal. Every word Brian said was like a sword, striking directly at my vulnerabilities. He was right-Annie would never blame Brian; she would only see it as my failure, my inability to protect our son.

"I don't believe it." In the end, these were the only three words I could force out, though deep in my heart, I knew it was the truth.
"Then you can try and see." Brian slowed his speech, his voice carrying a confidence and resolution I had never heardfrom a child before.

"Fine." I answered coldly, then hung up.

The car fell into dead silence. My breathing sounded particularly harsh in this quiet. Outside, New York City was ablaze with lights,but inside, it was dark, just like my mood. I looked at the new messages and comments continuously popping up on my phone screen, each one tearing at my reputation, my career, everything I had.
Just days ago, I had been the envy of Wall Street, an investment icon, a *Financial Times* cover star. Now, I had become a target of public scorn, a villain who hit his own child, a failing investor whose career was all but


over.

The most ironic part was that the person who had pushed me into this abyss was my own son, my own flesh and blood.

###Chapter 230: Your Matters Are My Matters

Howard's POV

I almost roughly pushed Annie down onto the bed, my desire-suppressed all day-finally erupting in this moment. Now it was my turn.

I leaned down to bite her lower lip, driven by a primal possessiveness.Annie let out a surprised whimper before responding with equal passion.her nails digging into my shoulders.leaving a burning sting.

"This time I won't let you take the lead." I whispered in her ear, my voice rough with desire. The sound coming from deep in my throat was almost foreign even to me.

Annie's eyes flickered with challenge. "Then prove it to me."

Those words were like a match to gunpowder, igniting the last remnant of my rationality. I yanked open her nightgown, buttons scattering with a distinct sound in the quiet room. Our lips crashed together, so intensely I could almost taste blood.

My kisses traveled down her neck, lingering at her collarbone. Her skin had an indescribable sweetness, like a perfectly ripe peach that begged to be bitten. My tongue traced the hollow of her collarbone,feeling her trembling transfer from her skin to my lips. My chest heaved with rapid breathing, each heartbeat pounding in my ears like a drum.

Her breathing grew increasingly urgent, her chest rising and falling dramatically. My palms covered herbreasts,feeling their softness and firmness. A primitive satisfaction rose from deep within me-at this moment, she belonged entirely to me, and I to her. Annie tilted her head back with a satisfied sigh, hands gripping the sheets, knuckles turning

white from the force.

Gone was any gentle exploration. My tongue slipped into her inner thighs.Annie impatiently shifted her body, clearly urging me further. Each movement inflamed my desire to the point of pain. But I decided to take my time, wanting her to experience something completely different from the afternoon.

This deliberate delay subjected me to exquisite torture-every muscle in my body tensed to its limit, sweat sliding down my spine. I clenched my jaw.forcing myself to maintain this slow rhythm, enjoying the challenge of self-control.

When I took her nipple in my mouth, she suddenly arched her back with an almost sobbing moan. My tongue circled that sensitive point,alternating between gentle and firm pressure, feeling it harden further in my mouth.

"Howard...please..."

Her plea filled me with intense satisfaction. This strong,independent woman was now vulnerable and wanting because of my touch. My fingers explored between her thighs, finding her already wet. An uncontrollable desire exploded within me.

She suddenly grabbed my wrist, then released it,as if wrestling with her last resistance. This contradiction made my blood race, the heat in my lower abdomen threatening to break all restraint.
I traced down her abdomen, my tongue lingering at her most sensitive spot. Annie's reaction was immediate-her thighs trembled violently, her feet arched, a moan escaping from deep in her throat. I could feel her abdominal muscles contracting in a rhythm that seemed synchronized with

my own heartbeat. I focused more intently on pleasuring her while feeling the ache of my own need, the desire for her nearly driving me mad.

"No.,, wait..." she suddenly pushed me away,her voice husky with desire and slight frustration, "not just me..."

Her hand moved downward to find my swollen manhood and gripped it without hesitation. I inhaled sharply as electricity shot from there to the top of my head, nearly blinding me. Her fingers moved skillfully,alternating between gentle and firm pressure, reducing my mind to a blank slate with only the most primitive instincts ddriving my body. I had to grab her wrist to stop her, or everything would end right then.
"Not enough..." Annie's voice carried unbearable longing, "I want you...now..."

I entered her suddenly. In that moment, all my senses were magnified-the tight heat of her nearly melted me, that enveloping sensation making my blood boil from my tailbone to the crown of my head. My mind went blank, consumed by the feeling of our connection, so intense I could barely breathe.

I forced myself to maintain the last shred of clarity. She opened her wet eyes,pupils dilated with desíre, that undisguised want nearly causing me to lose control completely.

I gripped her waist firmly, withdrawing almost completely before thrusting back in, keeping her locked in my rhythm. With each thrust, I felt my heart rate accelerate, blood coursing through my veins, every muscle stretched to its limit. The headboard hitting the wall mixed with our panting, creating the most primal symphony. Annie's moans became incoherent, her legs wrapped tightly around my waist like a drowning person clutching the last straw.

Sweat dripped from my forehead onto her chest. I could feel my heartbeat transferring to her through my chest, and hers responding in kind. This resonance gave me unprecedented satisfaction.

I lifted Annie so she straddled me, allowing me to penetrate deeper. Her nails left burning traces on my back, the mixture of pain and pleasure exciting me further. Our bodies pressed tightly together, sweat mingling.breaths intertwining.

She began to move on her own, initially slow and exploratory,then increasingly faster. My hands rested on her waist but didn't lead, letting her control the pace.
"I'm going to... I..." Annie's voice suddenly pitched higher, her body tensing sharply. I could feel her inner walls contracting violently, the sensation like being gripped by an invisible hand, each pulse bringing me closer to the edge. The pleasure was so intense I nearly lost consciousness.
"Together," I growled in her ear, hands firmly gripping her buttocks as I thrust upward. The climax hit with such force, like being swallowed by a tidal wave or falling from an immense height. Every muscle in my body tensed to its limit, each nerve ending burning, a blur of white light appearing at the edge of my vision. In that moment, time,space,identity,status-everything ceased to exist, leaving only our intertwined bodies and souls.

We collapsed onto the bed, maintaining our connection, Annie lying on my chest. I could feel her heartbeat gradually steadying. My fingers gently combed through her disheveled hair as I enjoyed this incomparable intimacy. My body still trembled slightly in the afterglow,a deep satisfaction rising from within.
"I've only recently discovered..." Annie began, her voice lazy and content,"

that you and the Howard Thompson the public sees are completely different people."


I chuckled softly. "Only you get to see this side." This wasn't flattery but truth. Before her. I had never shown my true self to anyone.

Annie looked up, tracing my features with her fingertip. "So I'm special?"Her tone was half-joking, half-serious.

"You know the answer." I kissed her forehead, holding her tighter.

We lay quietly embracing, enjoying each other's warmth and presence.I could feel her breathing becoming steady, suggesting she was falling asleep.But I had never been more awake-I realized this woman had unknowingly occupied the most important place in my life.

The phone's ring suddenly shattered our tranquility. I glanced at the caller ID.my brow furrowing slightly.

"Who is it?" Annie asked softly, her fingers drawing small circles on my chest.

"Philip." I answered, my voice immediately cooling.

Annie's body visibly tensed. "What does he want at this hour?" She sat up.pulling the silk sheet to her chest.

I answered the call. "What's the matter at this time of night?" My tone was calm and controlled, carrying the composure I'd cultivated through years in business.

Philip's voice came through the speaker, surprisingly calm: "Could you please put Annie on the phone? I need to talk to her about Brian."

I turned to Annie, silently asking for her opinion. I wanted to protect her.but also respected her enough to make her own decisions.

Annie took a deep breath and nodded slightly. I handed her the phone.my fingers briefly touching hers during the exchange, silently conveying my support.

"What is it? Speak directly." Annie's tone was neither warm nor cold,but guarded.

"Annie, do you know what Brian did today?" Philip's tone suddenly sharpened, containing suppressed anger.
"No. I don't." Annie replied coldly, fingers gripping the sheet tightly.

"You'd better check online first." Philip was practically gritting his teeth."Later,I'll bring Brian to the Thompson house. You should understand the facts before attempting to administer justice."
Annie couldn't even refuse before Philip hung up. The room fell silent again, with only Manhattan's lights flickering outside the window.

She returned the phone to me, brows furrowed. "He's always like this, so presumptuous."

"You don't want to get involved in their conflict,do you?" I asked,trying to understand her feelings.

Annie nodded, her long hair swaying gently on her shoulders. "I'm tired of Philip. Even after the divorce, he won't leave me alone..."

I held Annie's hand, hoping my touch could provide some comfort."Don't worry,I'm here."

Annie leaned against my chest, inhaling deeply. "Then I'll trouble you with this."


"It's no trouble," I said gently. my fingers running through her hair."Your matters are my matters."


I meant every word. With Annie, I'd found something I hadn't known I was missing. Her concerns were mine now, her battles were mine to fight.This wasn't obligation-it was choice.

###Chapter 231: Violence Is Never the Solution

I studied Philip and Brian sitting across from me, immediately noticing the prominent red swelling on the boy's cheek. The contrast between them was stark-a Wall Street tycoon and a kindergartener, both wearing expressions far too similar for comfort. I didn't speak immediately,instead observing this father-son pair, trying to read the unspoken story in their postures and expressions.

Philip sat rigidly, his perfectly tailored suit unable to mask the tension in his shoulders. His face, usually the picture of confidence that graced business magazines,now looked haggard. The circles under his eyes suggested he hadn't slept much. Brian, despite his small stature,maintained a composure that seemed eerily mature for his age. The child's hands were folded neatly in his lap, his gaze unwavering as he met mine.
"What's going on?" I finally asked, my voice calm but carrying enough weight to command attention.
Brían's eyes brightened, as if he'd finally found a lifeline. "Philip hit me,"he stated simply, his finger lightly touching the inflamed area on his cheek.

I turned my gaze to Philip, my expression unchanged,but I allowed my eyes to linger on his face. This man who once exuded confidence in every business meeting now looked somehow diminished, cornered.

"You hit a child?" I asked quietly, contemplating his choices as a father.Interesting how often those who appear most successful in the professional world make the most fundamental mistakes in family relationships.
"He didn't hold back at all," Brian added, his voice steady."You can see online. This slap almost made me deaf."

The child's words made me frown slightly. That hard? I had no interest in meddling in other people's family matters, but I had my principles. And striking a child crossed my line. My thoughts drifted to Lucy,imagining if someone had treated her this way. My reaction would likely be something Philip couldn't handle in his current state.

Philip met my gaze,seemingly sensing my thoughts. He hurried to defend himself: "You only see that I hit him, but aren't you going to ask why I would suddenly do such a thing?" His tone carried a barely detectable panic, as if searching for justification for his loss of control.
I looked at him, deliberately weighing each word before speaking: "Regardless of what happened. you should have talked to him properly instead of hitting himn. Violence solves nothing. Do you understand?"
Observing Philip's reaction was more meaningful than expressing anger.I've never believed emotional reactions solve problems, nor did I think placing myself on moral high ground would help.
"Even if he deliberately convinced Sarah to abort our child?" Philip countered, a flash of anger in his eyes.

This accusation surprised me slightly. What an odd argument-how could a five-year-old child influence an adult woman in such a significant decision? I silently considered the logical gaps in this reasoning.

A soft sound from the doorway drew my attention. Annie walked in,and I felt a subtle sense of relief. Her gaze immediately fell on Brian's swollen cheek,her brow furrowing almost imperceptibly.
"What happened?" Annie asked calmly, coming to stand beside me.

"Philip hit Brian," I summarized briefly."We're trying to understand why."

Philip,seeing Annie. grew more agitated, eager to justify himself: "Annie.you know what Brian is like. Sarah said he-"

Brian didn't let Philip finish, interrupting with unexpected passion: "The evidence is right in your face, and you're still trying to smear me? Philip,I'm not stupid! I'm not mute either! I have a mouth and can explain myself,okay?"

Philip whirled toward Brian, his voice rising: "Shut up! When adults are talking. you have no right to interrupt!"

I raised a hand to stop Philip's impending outburst: "Calm down." Then I turned to Brian: "Explain what happened."
Brian's expression relaxed somewhat, like he'd found someone willingto listen. He began explaining in detail: "After Sarah forced him to get a vasectomy, she was afraid he'd be angry, so she threatened to abort the baby..."


As I listened to Brian's narrative, I felt somewhat surprised: why would this child understand so many complex adult situations?
"Sarah was crying in front of him,claiming that I said awful things to her,which deeply affected her and made her want to abort the baby."
Brian continued, his face showing disdain beyond his years: "This kind of excuse-anyone with half a brain wouldn't believe it. Unfortunately, some people don't have brains."
I noticed Philip taking deep breaths, clearly struggling to control his emotions.
"He rushed to my house and hit me hard! To prove my innocence,I posted the evidence online, but then he blamed me for doing that too."

I turned to Philip. contemplating this complicated situation: "Is what he's saying true?"

Before Philip could answer. Brian added: "I have evidence to prove everything I'm saying is true."

Philip reluctantly admitted: "Yes." Then tried to justify himself: "Even if Sarah wrongfully accused you..."


Brian interrupted: "What do you mean 'even if she wrongfully accused me'? You're making it sound like she did nothing wrong, like I'm deliberately causing problems for her."

I saw Philip's expression darken as he suddenly stood up, clearly intending to strike Brian again. I calmly stepped forward,positioning myself between them: "Whatever needs to be said can be discussed properly. If you try to hit him again, don't blame me for being unpleasant."This wasn't a threat, merely a statement of principle.

Philip was forced to sit down, but remained dissatisfied: "Even if it was Sarah's fault, did you have to post the evidence online? Do you know this could ruin the Baker family?"

"If I didn't post it online, how else could I prove my innocence?" Brian replied with unusual composure.

"You could have shown the evidence to me," Philip said.

Brian countered: "If you were truly a man who believed in evidence, then after hearing Sarah's claims, you wouldn't have impulsively come looking for me. You would have first considered whether what Sarah said made sense,then made a judgment. Or perhaps gathered evidence to prove she was right before confronting me."

I had to admit. Brian's logic was remarkably clear.

"But the reality is, after Sarah made some ambiguous provocations, you were immediately controlled by your emotions and came to my home to bully me. In that situation. if I had given you the evidence..."

"You probably wouldn't have looked at it, then destroyed it in front of me,and continued to hit me." Brian's words made me marvel at his insight.

"Philip. I'm just a child now. I don't act with the same caution as adults.So after obtaining evidence, wanting to prove my innocence, I could only post it online. Let everyone see that I'm not the person you and Sarah claim I am. This was the best choice for me."

I listened quietly, objectively evaluating the conversation. Brian's thinking patterns and logic indeed seemed unusual for a typical five-year-old-intelligent in a way that reminded me of Annie. Meanwhile, Philip, as an adult, striking a child based on someone else's words was clearly questionable behavior.

Philip,unable to counter Brian's logic, resorted to pulling rank: "I am your father!"

Brian responded coldly, his voice calm but firm: "Not anymore."

That brief statement completely shattered what remained of Philip's dignity.He turned to me, almost pleading: "Do you think his way of handling this is right?"

I felt Annie's gaze meet mine, both of us understanding this was more than a simple family dispute. Looking at this child with extraordinary mental abilities despite his young age, I couldn't help but wonder: what kind of inner world had his experiences shaped?

Regardless, one thing seemed clear to me: violence is never the solution.especially with children.

###Chapter 232: Violence Is Never the Solutio (Part 2)

Howard's POV

"From my perspective." I finally broke the silence. "Brian's actions were reasonable."


The expression on Philip's face transformed instantly from hopeful to disbelieving. That flash of expectation in his eyes made me inwardly shake my head-he had naively assumed I would automatically side with him simply because we were both successful men. This mindset of dividing into camps without any critical thinking mirrored exactly how he treated his son.


"He anticipated potential consequences and prepared appropriate countermeasures," I continued analytically. "That's actually intelligent thinking."


The business world is like a battlefield, and I've always admired those who can see several moves ahead. Even in a child, this strategic thinking deserves recognition. If Brian hadn't been involved in hurting Annie,this kind of intelligence should have been nurtured rather than suppressed.Lucy likely possessed similar potential, though she had chosen silence over expression.

Philip impatiently tried to counter:"But-"

"There is no 'but," Brian calmly interrupted him, reminding me of myself as a child-learning composure and restraint far too early.
I studied this child, fascinated by his contradictions. So intelligent yet trapped in his own schemes, so young yet playing like a seasoned chess

master. His words to Philip were cutting: "Philip, whenever there's a problem,you automatically believe anything Sarah tells you. You don't even think."


Brian paused. "That's why you lost your wife, why your company's stock is plummeting... all of this is simply the price of your stupidity."

Philip's complexion changed immediately. His nostrils flared slightly. and his eyes flashed with rage. His fists clenched and unclenched at his sides.like a bull ready to charge. This was an investor ruled by emotions-a perfect example of what not to be. I'd seen too many like him in the business world. all eventually becoming someone else's prey.

"He's not entirely wrong," I said calmly. "As the CEO of an investment firm. you should maintain better emotional control."

My voice carried no emotional coloring: "If you act impulsively based on Sarah's one-sided account, how can shareholders trust you won't make equally rash decisions when the market fluctuates?"

That statement clearly hit a nerve. In the business world, having your decision-making abilities questioned is far more lethal than having your morals questioned.

Philip's Adam's apple bobbed as he visibly restrained his anger. It was interesting how he simultaneously displayed his fragile emotional control while trying to prove his decision-making was flawless.

Brian's gaze kept darting toward Annie, with a longing that reminded me of Lucy when she first came to my home-wanting to approach yet fearing rejection, wanting to leave yet reluctant to go. His inner world was probably more complex than anyone else's in this room.

"I should go," he finally said, his tone carrying a maturity that made my chest tighten.


"Would you like me to drive you?" The offer left my mouth before I could consider it, surprising even myself. Perhaps it was because I saw reflections of myself in him, or because Lucy had taught me to care about children's feelings.


"No need." he replied, curiosity flickering in his eyes. "I can get back by myself."


I walked him to the door and watched as he got into the car and departed.

When I returned to the living room, Philip was staring at Annie with an almost accusatory gaze. That arrogance reminded me of my first impression of him-a man accustomed to others accommodating him.

"When I was talking to Brian earlier," he said in a somber tone, "why didn't you have any reaction?"

Annie's gaze was calm as still water. "What reaction did you expect me to have?"

"Any reaction would be better than this indifference," Philip's voice grew sharp, accusafory. "Your attitude makes me wonder if you've been orchestrating everything from behind the scenes all along."

Absurd. I almost laughed at his assumption. In his world, women either submitted or schemed. He seemed incapable of imagining that Annie had simply transcended his control and embraced her authentic self.
I was about to interject when Annie spoke first.

"Philip," Annie's lips curled into a cold smile, "you're like an unvaccinated

rabid dog. desperate to bite anyone within reach."

Her voice dripped with sarcasm: "You thinkI orchestrated all this? I should be flattered that you believe I would waste my energy on you."

She shook her head slightly. "You're simply not worth the effort."

I silently withdrew my prepared response. Annie's reply was more perfect than anything I could have formulated-sharp and precise,striking directly at the core. This fearlessness, this willingness to confront challenges head-on, was one of the qualities I found most attractive about her.


Philip opened his mouth to counter but found himself speechless. His eyes widened slightly, lips pressed into a thin line, clearly unprepared for Annie to hit back so directly. His stunned expression made the corners of my lips turn up involuntarily. Annie's strength was exactly what I admired most-she was no longer a victim at others' mercy, but a force capable of dancing with the storm.

Philip's expression shifted from shock to anger. "You've changed, Annie.After leaving me, you've become harsh and cold."

"No," Annie calmly corrected him. "I've just stopped being afraid to speak the truth."

She glanced around the living room, seemingly tired of this meaningless confrontation. "You two can continue this conversation. I need to go upstairs to finish some work."

"I'll join you soon," I responded, hoping she could read the support in my eyes.
After Annie left, the air seemed to grow heavier. Philip stood there, his

expression a mixture of disbelief and irritation. The once-mighty investment elite now appeared somewhat pathetic.

"What else do you want to say?" I asked, my voice devoid of emotion."Continue fabricating more ridiculous accusations?"

Philip's jaw tightened. "Howard, you don't understand what you've gotten yourself into. Annie is far from as innocent as she appears."

This blind confidence reminded me of investors who stubbornly cling to their positions even as the market crashes around them. They always refuse to accept reality until it's too late.

"Let me tell you what I see: a father who struck his child based on his mistress's word. then tried to use 'paternal authority' to cover his mistake."
"That was discipline!" Philip raised his voice, his face flushing."Every father has the right to-"
"Damage a child's eardrum?" I interrupted calmly. "I didn't realize that in your world, this is called 'discipline.' In my world, it's called 'abuse."

Philip's lips pressed into a thin line, clearly lacking a reasonable counter-argument. He had probably never imagined being challenged so directly-Wall Street's darling, successful investor, people usually only complimented him rather than exposing him.

###Chapter 233: Are You Worried About Brian?

Howard's POV

After Annie left. I studied Philip-once a titan of Wall Street, now resembling a player who'd forgotten the rules of the game. Lost and disoriented. I'd encountered many like him in the business world:gleaming exteriors concealing hollow cores.

"T've noticed something interesting," I began deliberately, my voice carrying a calculated calmness as I observed his reaction. "Whenever Sarah is involved, you seem to lose all rational thought. Have you ever consídered why that might be?"

His brow furrowed and his gaze darted away. I recognized this expression immediately-the instinctive resistance when someone confronts a truth they're not ready to face. Years of business negotiations had honed my ability to read people. and his internal struggle was evident.

"Your actions have alreadly given me the answer," I continued, my tone measured but carrying undeniable weight. "You love Sarah. If that's the case,why not simply acknowledge it?"

I allowed silence to settle between us, not rushing to fill the void. From my perspective, accepting truth offers the best liberation for everyone.Annie had moved beyond her past, and I hoped to begin a new life with her,one unmarred by Philip's shadow.
"Why not simply admit it and build a life with Sarah? That would be the best outcome for everyone involved."
Philip's lips compressed into a tight line. "I don't know what caused me to lose control, but I can assure you, what I feel for Sarah isn't love."

His denial almost made me laugh. In the corporate world.I'd witnessed countless individuals blind to their own motivations. They'd rather believe their fabricated narratives than confront reality. Such psychological defense mechanisms were both tragic and amusing.

"Fine." I relented, "if you say it's not, then it's not."

I stood. gesturing toward the door. "Your business here is finished."

As I escorted Philip out, I noticed his repeated glances toward the staircase,clearly hoping Annie might appear. This longing sparked a flicker of pity in me-a man so stubbornly denying his true feelings while simultaneously refusing to let go of the past. He hesitated at the threshold.his internal conflict palpable. But ultimately, he left.
Closing the door, I inhaled deeply, feeling a wave of relief. For some reason, my thoughts turned to Lucy, to her initial silence and her gradual opening up. The connections between people are so fragile yet so powerful.We're all searching for someone who understands us, and when we find that person, life's meaning suddenly becomes clear.

Upstairs, I found Annie sitting on the balcony. She radiated an inner strength now, the composure that comes after weathering life's storms.
"Are you worried about Brian?" I asked softly,taking the seat beside her.

"More or less," she replied with a hesitation I rarely heard in her voice.

Annie drew a deep breath. "Seeing Philip treat him that way,I am concerned..."
I studied her expression, witnessing the complex emotions only a mother could feel. Despite her past hurts, despite her claimed abandonment, that connection wasn't easily severed. I thought of Lucy, of the warmth that

flooded through me the first time she called me "Dad."

"But Brian surprised me," she continued. "He's much stronger than I imagined."


I nodded in understanding. "He's clever-knows how to protect himself."
Like Lucy, I added silently. These children possessed remarkable resilience and wisdom, often beyond our expectations.

Annie shook her head gently. "It's not just cleverness. He seems to have truly recognized something, especially about Sarah's true nature. Perhaps this experience has opened his eyes."

Hearing her speak this way kindled a spark of hope within me. Perhaps Brian wasn't completely manipulated by Sarah as I'd initially thought.Perhaps he was just a child caught in the vortex of adult complexities,much as Lucy had once been.

"Do you think he's changed?" I asked quietly, careful to keep any bias from my tone.

Annie remained silent for a moment, conflict flickering in her eyes. "Maybe.Seeing him stand up to Philip like that made me feel..." she searched for the right words, "conflicted. On one hand, I'm relieved he can defend himself. On the other, it saddens me that he has to face these things at such a young age."

I understood this contradiction. When Lucy developed selective mutism, I'd experienced similar feelings-relieved she'd found a way to protect herself, yet heartbroken she felt compelled to do so.
"Do you want to reconnect with him?" I asked directly,hoping to help her sort through her thoughts. In business decisions, I always preferred

addressing the core issue.

Annie bit her lip, a small gesture betraying her uncertainty. "I don't know,Howard. I really don't. After he helped Sarah, I kepttelling myself I'd given up. But seeing him today. I'm not so sure anymore."

She turned to me, her eyes seeking guidance. "What do you think I should do?"

This question gave me pause. I recalled my decision to raise Lucy-not an impulsive choice, but a responsibility I'd embraced after careful consideration. Annie's situation was more complex, with wounds between her and Brian that couldn't easily be erased.

"I believe time will provide our answer," I finally said. "There's no need to rush a decision."

"But what if he has truly changed?" Annie asked softly. "What if he needs me?"

I took her hand, feeling its warmth. "Then when that moment comes, you'Il know what to do. Whatever you decide, I'll support you."

Gratitude shimmered in Annie's eyes. "That's why I love you,Howard.You always make complicated things clear."

I didn't tell her that she had taught me how to care for others,how to truly love. Before meeting her, my world consisted only of the company,responsibilities, and Lucy. Now, my life had new meaning and direction.
The Manhattan skyline stretched before us, city lights beginning to glimmer as dusk settled. In that moment of shared silence, I felt a sense of peace I'd rarely experienced before Annie entered my life. The complex web of relationships-Annie and Brian, Philip and Sarah, Lucy and her

past-all seemed less daunting when faced together.

"What about Lucy?" Annie asked suddenly. "Do you think she'd be open to having Brian visit sometime?"

The question surprised me. Lucy had made remarkable progress, but her world remained carefully controlled. Introducing someone new, especially a child with his own complexities, would require careful consideration.

"It's possible," I answered thoughtfully. "Lucy has been more willing to interact with others recently. But we'd need to approach it gradually."

Annie nodded, understanding the delicate balance. "Of course. I wouldn't want to disrupt her progress."

Her consideration for Lucy touched me deeply. Annie had never pressured this relationship or treated Lucy as an obstacle. Instead, she'd shown genuine care and patience, gradually earning Lucy's trust-something few had managed.


"What are you thinking?" Annie asked, noting my extended silence.

I smiled, realizing how thoroughly she'd come to read my expressions. "T'm thinking about how you've changed our lives. Both mine and Lucy's."

A hint of color rose in her cheeks. Even after all we'd shared,my sincere compliments still affected her. That blend of strength and vulnerability was uniquely Annie.

"And you've changed mine," she replied softly.

The evening air carried a slight chill now, and Annie leaned closer,seeking warmth. I wrapped an arm around her shoulders, drawing her against me.

"Do you think Philip will try to reconnect with Brian after this?" she asked after a moment.

I considered the question, thinking of the mnan who'd just left. "I doubt it.His pride seems to outweigh his paternal instincts. And with Sarah's influence..."


Annie's expression darkened slightly at Sarah's name. "She's dangerous,Howard. More than Philip realizes."

"I know," I replied, recalling the calculated manipulation that had nearly destroyed Annie. "But people only see what they're prepared to see."

"Poor Brian," Annie whispered. "Caught between them."

Her compassion, even after everything, confirmed what I already knew-beneath her newfound strength remained the same caring heart that had first drawn me to her. Despite her claimas of having given up on Brian,maternal concern still lingered.

"He's resilient," I assured her. "And surprisingly resourceful."

Annie smiled faintly. "He getsthat from me."

Pride colored her voice, and rightfully so. Brian's intelligence and adaptability reflected Annie's own qualities-qualities that had helped her survive her marriage to Philip and rebuild her life afterward.

The city stretched before us, a tapestry of lights against the darkening sky.Tomorrow, Lucy would return, and our home would once again be filled with her presence. Perhaps someday, if circumstances aligned, Brian might join us too. Not to replace what was lost, but to create something new.
"Whatever happens," I said, pressing a kiss to Annie's temple, "we'll face it

together."

She nodded, her head resting against my shoulder. In that moment,the future-with all its uncertainties-felt less daunting. We had found each other.and that made all the difference.

###Chapter 234: I Was Wrong

Philip's POV

I sat in my car, fingers unconsciously tapping against the steering wheel.The lights outside Howard's mansion remained bright, stinging my exhausted eyes. That man-Howard Thompson-his voice echoed in my mind like a ghost: "An investor ruled by emotions is truly a pathetic sight."

Pathetic. The word cut through my pride like a sharpened blade.

*The lion of Wall Street, reduced to a lamb for slaughter.*

Everything I had prided myself on-my achievements,my reputation,my wealth-suddenly seemed so fragile. I drew a deep breath, feeling a tightness in my chest as if invisible hands were strangling me. There was a time when I could maintain perfect composure during the most intense trades, yet now. I couldn't even manage my own family affairs.

Brian's words hammered against my heart with crushing weight: "You don't even think. That's why you lost your wife, why your company's stock is plummeting... all of this is simply the price of your stupidity."

*A five-year-old child. My son. I've been completely exposed by a five-year-old child,*

My hands gripped the steering wheel tighter, knuckles turning white from the pressure. Was it true? Had I really been as blind as he claimed?

The long-standing confidence within me began to collapse. A wave of dizziness washed over me, forcing me to close my eyes and wait for the sensation to pass.
*Philip Baker doesn't make such elementary mistakes. Philip Baker is

always right.*

But the evidence proved otherwise. I had been wrong. Repeatedly,consistently wrong.

I suddenly recognized a disturbing pattern-ever since Sarah entered my life. the same scenario kept playing out: Sarah would come to me in tears,claiming someone had hurt her; I'd see her tearful face and immediately become her protector; she'd whisper who had "wounded" her; I'd confront that person without a second thought; and ultimately, that person would produce evidence proving they'd been falsely accused.

*Who am I really protecting? A woman in need, or just satisfying my own vanity with a hero complex?*

This realization hit like a sledgehammer to my temple. My heartbeat grew erratic, heat rushed to my head, a buzzing filled my ears.

"Fuck!" I slammed my fist against the steering wheel, the hard mnetal beneath the leather cover connecting with my palm, the sharp pain eliciting a growl from my throat. "You idiot! You fucking idiot!"

I gasped for air, sweat dripping down my forehead onto my suit.I remembered Annie's gaze-that mixture of disappointment and pity.She had seen through everything long ago, while I remained oblivious,an arrogant fool.

"Annie was right..." I murmured, my throat constricting around the words,"She was right all along."
I recalled when Sarah first claimed Annie was jealous of her, how I believed her without hesitation. Every time I confronted Annie, she would refute my accusations, but I never once doubted Sarah's words.

*Do I love Sarah, or do I just love feeling like her savior?*

The question cut through me like a dll knife, slow and agonizing.I recalled everything that had transpired that day-that damn vasectomy.I had initially refused, but when my mother threatened suicide if I didn't agree.I relented.


The fear and anger after the surgery washed over me again. That feeling of being manipulated, of having my body violated-I had never felt so helpless in my life. Even during the worst financial crises, I could at least make my own decisions. But this time...

*I can never father another child. She took away my choice.*

The thought made my stomach churn, and I hastily rolled down the window, the cold air sweeping across my damp forehead. To quell my anger, Sarah had pretended to consider abortion. A brilliant move-she knew I would never allow my child to be terminated. So I rushed to stop her, and when backed into a corner, she immediately shifted the blame to Brian.

I couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh, feeling the muscles in my cheek twitch. Brian was right; I truly had been monumentally stupid. If I had thought rationally, Sarah's story was full of holes:

Why would Brian convince Sarah to get an abortion? What could he possibly gain from that?
*All lies. From beginning to end, carefully crafted lies.*

An unprecedented rage exploded within me, and I made a strange sound between laughter and sobbing. I punched the dashboard, my vision blurring with tears. This wasn't how Philip Baker responded to situations.

Philip Baker was calm, rational, always in control. But now...

"She played me... like a goddamn puppet!" My voice echoed in the confined space of the car, sounding strangely foreign. I shoved the car door open, the cold wind hitting my face, but failing to extinguish the shame and anger burning inside me. I bent over, hands braced on my knees.gulping air, trying to calm the emotions threatening to tear mne apart.

By forcing me to get a vasectomy, Sarah had ensured the child in her womb would be my only heir. By accusing Brian, she had eliminated competition for my assets. Each of her moves had been calculated with such precision, and I... I had accepted it all without question!

"My career..." I whispered. collapsing back into the car and shutting the door,my forehead pressing heavily against the cold steering wheel. When the markets opened tomorrow morning, what would happen to Baker Investment's stock? I swallowed with difficulty, nausea rising in my throat.Year-end bonuses, partnership shares, board positions... everything I had painstakingly built would turn to ashes within hours.

*I can solve complex financial derivative problems, yet couldn't see through a woman's simple lies.*

I slumped in the driver's seat, staring vacantly at my blurred reflection in the windshield. The once-shining, Philip Baker, now a hollow shell. With trembling fingers, I loosened my tie, feeling as if it were strangling me.
My phone suddenly vibrated-it was Sarah.

My heart skipped a beat, my stomach turning. Sarah. A name that once accelerated my heartbeat now sent a chill through me. I stared at the screen, almost able to see her beautiful face streaked with artificial tears,weaving her next deception.

"You want me to fall for it again?" I growled at the screen. "What do you want? My blood? My marrow? My soul?"

The phone continued to vibrate insistently. I knew she would keep calling until I answered. A mixture of fury and curiosity made me want to smash the phone. yet I couldn't help wondering what new story she would fabricate.

I jabbed the answer button, my finger whitening from the pressure. The tenderness and affection I once felt for her had vanished, replaced by an icy determination.

"What do you want to tell me?" My voice was low and dangerous.

On the other end, Sarah's breathing sounded slightly hurried: "Philip,about what happened today,we need to talk..."
Her voice remained sweet, carrying that vulnerability I had once found irresistible.

I gripped the phone tightly,saying nothing.

"Philip? Did you hear me?" Her voice now carried a hint of unease.
	
###Chapter 235: I Won't Bother You Anymore

Sarah's POV

I ran my tongue over the bite mark on my lip, tasting the metallic sweetness of blood. My eyes remained fixed on the glaring headline on my phone screen. Brian-that five-year-old child-had somehow managed to push me into such a precarious position.

Philip knew the truth now. He knew Brian had never contacted me. Knew that every word I'd told him was fabricated.

My heartbeat accelerated, thoughts racing through my brain like electric currents. How could I have let this slip through the cracks?

*Deep breath. Stay calm.*

My fingertip gently tapped the screen, dialing Philip's number. The call was answered almost immediately, and the coldness in his voice made my spine involuntarily stiffen.

"What do you want to tell me?" he asked.

His tone concealed a knife. In my mind, I could picture his expression at this moment-those sharp eyes that normally tracked market trends now analyzing my every move with the same clinical detachment. The thought made my lips tremble slightly.

"Philip..." I deliberately infused my voice with a hint of vulnerability.A pause. A breath. This performance came to me as naturally as breathing."Even you don't believe me anymore?"
From the other end of the line, he let out a barely audible cold laugh:"The fact that you're calling me means you've seen the news online too."

After a moment of silence, he continued: "With all the evidence in front of me. how can I possibly believe you?"

A chill spread through my body. Once, Philip had been so easy to manipulate-a tearful gaze, a small sob was enough to make him surrender his trust. Now, he spoke to me as if I were a stranger.

"I might have remembered incorrectly..." My voice quivered just right, like a feather landing on the surface of a lake, light and fragile.

My fingers unconsciously brushed across my abdomen, though I knew he couldn't see the gesture. It helped me stay in character: "You know, since I've been pregnant. my memory hasn't been the best..."

"Continue," he said.

Those two flat syllables irritated me. The old Philip would have softened immediately, would have rushed to comfort me. This change caught me off guard.

A flash of inspiration struck me: "I remember now! It might have been when I went to pick up Brian at the Upper East Side Private Preschool recently.He told me then."

The moment the words left my mouth, I realized how absurd this excuse was. But there was no turning back now.

Philip's response was calmer than I'd anticipated:"Your son and Brian aren't even at the same preschool anymore. And Brian moved out long ago." His voice remained steady, as if dismantling a toy:"Why would you be picking up Brian instead of your own son?"
How stupid. I surprised myself with such an elementary mistake.

I could feel my heartbeat quickening,palms slightly damp with sweat. No,it couldn't endlike this. At the very least, I needed to maintain the appearance of being wronged and innocent.

I softened my voice, carefully controlling the degree of trembling in my tone: "I just wanted you and Brian to have a good relationship. As a mother. I'm willing to humble myself..."

I intentionally squeezed a hint of moisture from the corner of my eye, the tremor in my voice perfectly calibrated-this trick had always been effective on Philip.

But his cold voice cut through the emotional web I'd carefully woven: "If you were truly that good to Brian, we would still be living together as a family. It's precisely because you made life difficult for him at every turn that he moved to Ruth's place, isn't it?"

"Stop pretending to care about Brian. We both know that's not true."

My nails dug into my palm as I suppressed the anger surging within me.This man, once so easy to control, now dared to speak to me in such a tone.

"I won't believe another word you say."

His statement hit me like a slap. My thoughts briefly went blank with shock before quickly regaining composure.

"Is that so?" I gently stroked my abdomen, even though only I could feel this gesture. This child was like an ace up my sleeve, but clearly now wasn't the time to play it.
Men are always fickle. Philip's anger would subside. What I needed now was a strategic retreat.

"Since you hate me so much right now. I won't bother you anymore."I injected carefully calculated sadness into my voice and hung up before he could respond.

The moment the call ended, the mask slipped away. I massaged my temples, feelings of frustration coiling around my heart like a venomous snake. I shouldn't have allowed Philip to confront Brian directly. The smarter approach would have been to ask Philip to forgive Brian on account of his youth and ignorance. That way, even if Philip wanted to assign blame, he wouldn't have been so blunt, and my true intentions would have remained perfectly concealed.

A sharp pain exploded in my forehead. I had always prided myself on being calculating-how could I make such a basic error at this critical moment? A thought flashed through my mind-pregnancy had indeed affected my judgment. The idea made me smile slightly. What a perfect excuse.

As the emotional turbulence gradually subsided, my thouaghts became clearer. Since the Philip avenue was temporarily closed, Robert became my next target. How was his new project with Howard progressing? Perhaps Robert really could use this opportunity to make a comeback?

My fingertips glided across my phone screen, opening my conversation with Robert. His feelings for me were like a well-thumbed old book-every page so familiar it was tedious, yet for that very reason, easy to manipulate.
I pondered for a moment, then took out the abortion appointment form from my bag, quickly photographed it, and sent it. This move was quite risky, but also perfectly timed-I knew exactly how Robert would react.
Sure enough, in less than thirty seconds, his reply arrived as expected:"You don't want our child anymore?"

The panic and pain behind those few words seemedto penetrate the screen and reach my senses, bringing a tingling satisfaction. That familiar sense of power flowed through my veins again, warm and intoxicating.

A man's love is nothing more than a stepping stone towards my ultimate goal. Whether Philip or Robert, they were all just pieces I could move on my chessboard. If one piece faltered, another would take its place.

I closed my eyes, allowing the waves of renewed confidence to wash over me. The initial shock from Philip's rejection was fading, replaced by a cold clarity that had served me well throughout my life. His defiance was merely a temporary setback,not a defeat.

###Chapter 236: Remarriage

Robert's POV

The amber liquid swirled in my tumbler, ice cubes clinking against crystal in a rhythmic percussion that pierced the silence of my Brooklyn apartment. Here, amid Manhattan's perpetual cacophony, I'dI somehow created an island of solitude. This isolation wasn't new to me-it had been my constant companion since my family's financial collapse.

Finally, a moment of respite. These past weeks had been relentless, like trying to outrun a hurricane. Daylight hours were consumed by endless meetings. investor negotiations, and team coordination; nights belonged to data analysis and strategic planning. But things were looking up. The exhaustion seemed worth it now.

Two phones lay side by side on my coffee table-my personal device and the "Howard account" phone I used exclusively for communicating with Sarah. Every time I looked at them, I experienced a peculiar sense of division. as if I existed in parallel realities. One held the authentic me, with all my desires and struggles; the other contained the character I played-"Howard"-coolly observing Sarah's true nature.
I took a sip of whiskey, my thoughts still lingering on today's project developments. Just as I was about to review data for tomorrow's meeting.my personal phone vibrated.
Sarah.

A reflexive tension climnbed up my spine. I hated this reaction-this involuntary response to a woman who had abandoned me, who only remembered my existence when she needed money. I toyed with the device,hesitating to open her message as if something harmful lurked behind the

screen.

Eventually, I tapped it open. In that moment. I felt my blood freeze in my veins-it was an abortion appointment form, Sarah's name clearly printed at the top.

A thousand thoughts exploded in my mind, but one overpowered all others: that was my child. My second child with Sarah. A life I hadn't met yet but had already begun imagining a future for.
My stomach contracted violently, fingers trembling beyond my control, the world seemingly spinning around me. This sensation was terrifyingly familiar-identical to when Sarah left with Max, that toxic blend of helplessness, rage, and despair. But this was worse because I wouldn't even have the chance to meet this child.

"You don't want our child anymore?" I typed frantically, my fingertips nearly cracking the screen.
After sending it, I collapsed onto the sofa, feeling like a fish gasping on dry land. I despised this feeling-this powerlessness. I hated Sarah's hold over me, hated my own weakness, but most of all, I hated my inability to protect even my unborn child.

Every second waiting for her reply was torture. I stared at the screen as if it were a lifeline. Images of Max flashed through my mind-his first time calling me "Daddy," his tiny hand clutching mine. Now, thinking I might never see his brother or sister brought a pain like my heart was being shredded.

Sarah's reply finally appeared:

"This is the fruit of our love. Of course I wouldn't give it up."

"Don't worry."

A warm relief washed over me, only to be immediately chilled by her explanation:

"I just made this appointment to scare Philip because he's refusing to give me living expenses."

My relief transformed into shock, then rage. She was using an unborn life as leverage to threaten Philip? *My child* had become her bargaining chip?
The anger quickly morphed into self-doubt-I had fallen into her trap once again. Unconsciously, I glanced toward the "Howard" phone, recalling all the evidence I'd gathered over these weeks-the same woman who appeared vulnerable and in need of protection with me was confident and aggressively seductive with "Howard."

But when I thought about the life growing inside her, that anger softened into a strange hope. I'd already lost Sarah once; I couldn't bear to lose our second child too. The project was progressing well, my finances were improving-perhaps things could be different this time? Maybe we could start over?

An almost pathological longing surged within me-the desire fora complete family. I knew it was irrational, knew Sarah probably didn't deserve it, but emotions rarely follow logic.
"Once I complete my current project, why don't you remarry me?"I proposed boldly. "I promise you won't have to live like this anymore,constantly fearing abandonment."
After sending this message, my heart nearly burst from my chest. As an investor, I normally excelled at calculating risk and return, but with Sarah.

I seemed to lose this ability. left with nothing but blind hope and fear.

"Alright."

Those simple letters appeared on the screen, turning my world upside down.Hope blazed like wildfire in my chest. *I can do this.* The project was going well, investor feedback was positive, the team was functioning smoothly. A few more months, and I could provide Sarah and our children the life they deserved. I could be a successful husband again,a worthy father.


This excitement drove me back to work. I opened my laptop and began reviewing data for tomorrow's meeting, hoping to prepare more thoroughly to showcase the project's potential. That's when the "Howard" phone chimed.


I picked it up absentmindedly, expecting some trivial message. But when I saw the screen's contents, my brain seemed to short-circuit. It was a screenshot of the message I'd just sent Sarah, accompanied by text:

"See, this is what a real ex-husband does-my ex-husband only cares about me and gives me money."

"Now look at Annie's ex-husband..."

"He claims to love her with words, but in reality, he only hurts her."

My heart raced as I continued reading:

"Though Annie's ex isn't stingy either. At least he's generous with spending on me. What does that tell you?"
"It means I'm worth being loved."

"It means men find me valuable, worth their financial investment."

"But Annie is different."

"Men find her cheap, which is why they're so stingy with her."

"So,dating Annie really isn't as good as considering me. You should experience why someone like me is more worthy of love."

In that moment. I felt a strange deadness envelop me. Not pain, not even anger,but a profound stillness that reached into my marrow, like the eerie calm at a hurricane's eye. What Sarah didn't realize was that while thinking she was seducing Howard, she was actually showing me her true face,tearing away the last veil of pretense.

Over the past weeks, through these two accounts, I'd already seen considerable evidence. But a voice deep inside had always defended her:maybe she was forced into it, maybe she had no choice, maybe deep down she still cared for me. Now, this final illusion shattered completely.

I stared at those words, surprised to find the ache in my chest actually diminishing. It felt like a long-infected wound finally being thoroughly cleaned-painful in the process, but followed by unprecedented clarity and release.

Sarah never loved me. She only loved what I could give her. This fact,which had lingered in my consciousness but which I'd deliberately ignored,was now undeniable.

I suddenly thought of Max's smiling face, of the life growing in Sarah's womb. I remembered the humiliation of my poverty, the loneliness of my wealth. All these formed a complex puzzle, but the pattern was finally clear-my life shouldn't exist merely to satisfy Sarah. My love and

responsibility for my children didn't need to be channeled through her.

I picked up my personal phone and typed without hesitation: "What exactly do you mean by this?"

Simultaneously. I used the "Howard" account to reply: "I think we need to talk about your views on Annie."

Before sending these two messages, I felt an unprecedented serenity wash over me. The chaos in my mind settled into a strange calm, as if after years of turbulence. I'd finally found solid ground.

###Chapter 237: Don't Talk to Me Like That

Sarah's POV

My finger hovered over the screen, a chill creeping up my spine. My heart skipped a beat.

"Is money all you care about?" Howard's message stung like ice against my skin.

I stared at the text, my hands trembling slightly. No one had ever questioned my motivations so directly. Especially not Howard-the carefully selected target, the man who could solve my financial problems forever.


I bit my lower lip hard, my left hand unconsciously tugging at a strand of hair, a small habit I'd developed during moments of anxiety. What had I done wrong? I was merely showing him how Robert still valued me,enough to remarry me. This should have made Howard see how desirable I was,how worthy.

"That's not it at all!" I typed frantically, my fingertips creating a rapid staccato against the screen. He'd completely misunderstood me.
"Isn't it?" His reply came with unexpected swiftness. "Then why tell me about other men being generous with you, willing to spend money on you?


I jumped to my feet, pacing to the other side of the room and back again.My breathing quickened as I felt my pulse throbbing at my temples.Howard couldn't slip through my fingers like this. He was Manhattan's most valuable bachelor, even wealthier than Philip.

I sank back onto the sofa,fingers hovering over the keyboard. How could I explain this ina way that would salvage the situation? Every word needed careful consideration.

"I just wanted you to know I'm important to men, unlike Annie who can't inspire men to spend money on her," I finally typed.

After sending it. I stared at the screen, unconsciously gnawing at my right thumbnail. This feeling was so foreign-me, Sarah Johnson, usually the one controlling the conversation, now anxious waiting for a man's response.
Finally.a message appeared:


"Rather than constantly trying to get my attention, perhaps you should focus on improving your relationship with Philip."
I jolted backward as if physically pushed by those words. My stomach tightened, a sour taste rising in mythroat. This wasn't the expected response. Usually, men displayed obvious jealousy and possessiveness when hearing about another man's interest in me. Why wasn't Howard following the usual script?
"Otherwise, Philip will eventually choose Annie over you."


My fingers slid weakly across the screen, my phone dropping onto my lap.My vision blurred momentarily before I blinked hard,taking deep breaths to steady myself.
Rising from the sofa, I walked to the window, arms wrapped tightly around myself. Outside, Manhattan's lights twinkled, the illuminated windows in high-rises looking like cold eyes staring back at me. Among those lights was a building owned by Howard Technologies.So close,yet so far away.

Philip choosing Annie over me? The thought accelerated my heartbeat.Philip had never truly forgotten Annie. Several times when I'd entered his study unexpectedly, I'd caught him holding that photograph of himself with Annie and Brian, his expression softer than I'd ever seen directed at me. But I'd always told myself that as long as Annie continued to reject him.I had a chance.

I picked up my phone from where it had fallen on the sofa, as Howard continued:

"You keep saying Philip doesn't spend money on Annie because he doesn't think she's important."

"So think about it..."

"If he truly had to choose, would Philip pick you or Annie?"

My nails dug deep into my palm, leaving four crescent-shaped marks.My throat tightened, my heart beating heavily in my chest. Thisquestion was like a key, unlocking fears I'd deliberately locked away.

"Right now, Annie is the one rejecting Philip, which is why Philip has time for you."

"But what if..."

"What if one day Annie's attitude softens? Don't you think Philip would abandon you without hesitation to return to her?"

I walked to the mirror, staring at my reflection. My carefully applied makeup now looked like a thin mask covering my real fears. I closed my eyes,remembering how Philip's voice changed whenever he mentioned Annie. That tenderness and nostalgia wwere something he never had when looking at me.

My hand slid across the mirror's surface, as if trying to erase these unwelcome truths. The fact was Philip had never truly given up on Annie.and I was just... a replacement?

An unprecedented feeling of powerlessness washed over me. My knees weakened, and I slid down against the wall to the floor. Usually, I could control my interactions with men, knowing when to appear vulnerable and when to seem strong. But Howard seemed to see through every strategy.
"Isn't that humiliating for you?" Howard's question struck directly at my pride.

A sudden surge of anger heated my cheeks. I grabbed my phone,fingers flying across the screen:

"Don't talk to me like that. You're hurting me."

After sending it, I stared intently at the screen. waiting for the small dots indicating he was typing. Waiting for an apology, or at least some comforting words.
However, the screen maintaineda terrible silence. Minutes stretched into eternity, with no response from Howard. No apology,no explanation,nothing.

I stood up,pacing again. The room suddenly felt too small, the air too thin.I opened the balcony door, letting the cold night air rush in, clearing my head slightly.
I racked my brain reviewing our conversation, searching for what had gone wrong. The old Howard had always maintained a restrained yet polite attitude, elegantly keeping his distance without seeming cold.Today he seemed like a completely different person.



I pressed my fingertips against my temples, thoughts racing. Perhaps...had I unknowingly revealed too much about my relationships with other men? Most successful men during the pursuit phase prefer someone without complicated emotional entanglements. Especially elite men like Howard-they need reliable partners, not women who might bring negative publicity.

I took a deep breath, tucking my disheveled hair behind my ear. No,I couldn't give up like this. Howard was the most ideal target I'd encountered-wealth. status, power, plus Lucy's guardianship. If I could become his wife, I'd not only forever escape financial worries but also secure the position in Manhattan high society I'd always dreamed of.
I returned to the bedroom, standing before the closet. Inside hung several expensive dresses, all giftsfrom Philip. I gently stroked a silk dress,contemplating my next move.
Perhaps my approach was wrong. Maybe Howard didn't like the image of a woman pursued by multiple men. He seemed to appreciate loyalty and determination, just like himself. I needed to change tactics. Instead of flaunting how other men pursued me, I should demonstrate what I could bring Howard-understanding,support,and loyalty.

I walked back to the bed, picking up my phone for one last look. The screen still showed no new messages. I placed it on the nightstand and lay down,staring at the ceiling.
Tomorrow. Tomorrow I would approach Howard with an entirely new strategy. I would show him I wasn't just a pretty face, but a woman who could understand ad support him. I would carefully hide my desire for his wealth, even though that was my most genuine goal.
Whatever disguise it took, I would win Howard Thompson.

###Chapter 238: Our Future

Howard's POV

These past two days alone with Annie felt like adream.When we weren't making love, we were talking. as if the world had narrowed down to just the two of us. The weekend had gifted us with unexpected solitude-the Parkers had taken Lucy out for the weekend. This rare tranquility provided me the chance to truly contemplate what I wanted in life.

Now. Annie nestled in my arms as we sat quietly on the balcony. The subtle scent of lilac from her hair mingled with her unique fragrance,drifting into my senses and stirring something deep within me. Her skin pressed against mine, warm and soft. I could feel each of her breaths, her chest rising and falling slightly,gradually synchronizing with my own breathing.

How long had it been since I'd experienced such serenity? Since taking over the company and caring for Lucy, every day had been filled with responsibilities and constant activity. But now, these moments with Annie had sparked a thought in me-I wanted this to last forever.

"What are you thinking about?" she asked softly, her breath brushing against my chin and sending small currents of electricity through me.
"About you," I answered honestly, my fingers unconsciously tracing circles on her back, feeling her warmth through the fabric of her clothes. "About how beautiful all of this is."

Annie shifted slightly in my embrace, the warm and wet sensation sending a rush of heat to my groin. She tilted her face upward, her gaze carrying a hint of mischief, clearly noticing my reaction.

She smiled, a sound like flowing honey, sweet and enticing. I couldn't resist leaning down to kiss her lips. Initially just a gentle touch,but quickly, the kiss deepened and intensified. Her response carried the same passion, and when our tongues met, I felt every drop of blood in my body begin to boil.

My hand unconsciously moved from her back to her breast, feeling the soft curves beneath my touch. Her skin trembled slightly at my caress,releasing a gentle sigh. That sound nearly broke my control. I wanted her-a desire that seemed to burn through every inch of my skin.

Suddenly, she gently pushed me away, her chest rising and falling,her breathing unsteady.

"Wait," she said softly, her voice slightly hoarse with desire, "I need totake my birth control pill first."

In that moment, a thought became crystal clear-I didn't want to be with her just for tonight; I wanted every night, every tomorrow. Realizing this,I loosened my hold, but my gaze never left her face.

I caught her wrist, feeling the pulse beating there, as rapid as my own heart.

"What is it?" Annie asked, her brow slightly furrowed, eyes flickering with confusion and a hint of unease. The air between us seemed to thicken,filled with unspoken words.
"Don't go," I said, my voice low and determined. "We need to talk."

Annie sat back down beside me, that familiar lilac scent surrounding me once more. Her shoulder lightly pressed against mine, the warm contact softening my heart. She didn't speak, just waited quietly, but her eyes were

full of questions.

I took a deep breath, savoring this moment of peace and intimacy. I was accustomed to precise calculations and strategic thinking in the New York business world, but right now, I wanted the simplest, most direct expression.

"Annie," I began, my voice much softer than usual, a tone that even felt strange to me, "Maybe you don't need to take that pill."

Her eyes widened slightly, her brow creasing. I could feel her body momentarily tense. "Why? Do you... want a child?" Her voice carried a trace of tension and uncertainty.
The question made me pause. A child. I had never seriously considered this question. Since William and his wife's yacht accident, all my energy had been devoted to raising Lucy and running the company. The former Howard Thompson,once a prominent figure in the business world, had unconsciously transformed into a single uncle, almost forgetting that he too could have a complete family.
"No, not right now," I finally said, looking directly at her, hoping to convey my genuine thoughts. "Actually, I want to ask you,will you marry me?"

The question came out more directly than I had planned. I had no ring prepared, hadna't bent my knee, had no romantic plans in place. Just a simple question, yet it contained all my hopes for the future.
Annie's expression transformed from surprise to complexity, her lips slightly parted, as if wanting to say something but not knowing where to begin. I could feel my heartbeat growing faster, my palms slightly damp.This nervousness was something I hadn't experienced in any business

negotiation for many years.

She lowered her head, biting her lower lip. The fingers in my grasp trembled slightly; I could sense her inner struggle.

"Howard. I... there's something I must tell you," she looked up, her voice almost a whisper, tears glistening in her eyes. "I probably... can't give you children."


This confession sent a jolt through my heart. So that's what it was. That's where her worry stemmed from. I recalled the complex emotions that flashed in her eyes whenever Lucy was mentioned, and everything suddenly became clear. I tightened my grip on her hand,feeling her warmth,hoping to convey my support.

"What happened?" I asked softly, trying to keep my voice steady.

Annie took a deep breath, as if gathering courage. Her eyelashes fluttered slightly, tears welling in her eyes. "After my marriage with Philip began having problems. I fell down the stairs," she said,her voice tinged with self-reproach."The doctor said I might not be able to conceive again."

She looked up, tears finally falling,glistening like crystals in the moonlight.
"I don't want to deceive you. If you want your own children, then I..."her voice choked, unable to continue.

In that moment, I felt an unprecedented urge to protect her. I wanted to hold her close, tell her everything was alright. After so many years in the business world, I'd seen too many marriages formed for profit, too many families maintained just for the sake of children. But what Annie gave me was something entirely new, a genuine emotional connection untainted by any utilitarian motives.

I didn't let her continue, carefully reaching out to touch her lips with my fingertips. That softness melted my heart, while also making me more certain of my decision.

"Annie, listen to me," I slowed my speech, hoping each word would convey my sincerity. In front of her, I was no longer the CEO of Howard Technologies, no longer that cold businessman only concerned with profits and market share. At this moment. I was just an ordinary man wanting to protect the person he loved. "I have Lucy. And I don't need more children.What I need is you."

Her eyes widened,her lips trembling slightly, the tears making her eyes particularly bright in the moonlight. I could feel her hand tightening slightly in mine, as if trying to confirm this wasn't a dream. "Are you sure?You really don't mind?"

"I don't mind at all," I anaswered without hesitation, my voice carrying unprecedented certainty. Deep down, I knew this was true. Lucy's presence had already fulfilled all my aspirations for the role of "father.""Lucy is enough. We don't need to have a child to prove anything."

I continued, explaining my thoughts to her. After Lucy's parents died,I had considered my life choices. But reality quickly put that idea on hold.It wasn't until I met Annie that I began to imagine a shared future again.
"For me, family means love and responsibility, not blood ties," I said softly,wiping the tears from her cheek. "Lucy isn't my biological daughter, but I love her more than anything. The three of us can be a perfect family."

Annie held my hand tightly, her eyes continually fixed on me, as if verifying every word I said. I looked back at her, my gaze steady. In this moment, I was more certain of my feelings than ever before.

"Will you really be satisfied with that?" she finally asked softly, her voice still carrying a hint of uncertainty.

I leaned forward. my forehead lightly pressing against hers,our breaths mingling. "Annie," I said softly, "I would give up the entire company for your happiness. To me, you're not just a partner; you're the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. You've made me realize that besides my career, life has much more worth cherishing."

Her eyes moistened again, but this time with joy. I could feel her body relaxing, that wariness and concern slowly melting away in the warmth between us.


She nodded slightly, the corners of her mouth turning upward,revealing the most beautiful smile of the evening. "Alright, I accept. When Lucy returns. we'll ask for her opinion. If she agrees,we'll get married."

This promise instantly filled my heart with joy. I knew Lucy would accept Annie. In fact, she had already expressed her affection for Annie in many small details. A few days ago, I had accidentally discovered a drawing in her sketchbook-three people holding hands in front of a house, with "My Family" written above it. In that moment, I knew Lucy was also longing for this day.

"Now," I moved closer to her, my thumb gently caressing her cheek, "can we continue where we left off?"

Annie's face flushed pink as she nodded slightly. This time,we both knew no contraception would be necessary.
I carried her toward the bedroom, my mind painting a picture of a future belonging to the three of us. Not the future I had imagined, but one more beautiful than I could have ever envisioned.

###Chapter 239: Let's Do It Together

Annie's POV

The moment Howard carried me to the bedroom, I felt an unprecedented sense of belonging. His movements were gentle yet strong, as if I were a fragile treasure. He placed me on the deep red silk sheets, looking down at me with intensity. Moonlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a soft silver glow on his angular profile.

"You're so sexy," he said, his voice low and husky. His gray eyes flickered with unmistakable desire in the dim light, yet contained a heart-stirring restraint.

I didn't answer with words. Instead, I slowly reached up, wrapping my arms around his neck and drawing him toward me. My fingertips brushed the hair at his nape, feeling him shiver slightly at this simple touch.I unbuttoned his shirt one by one, each moment my fingertips made contact with his skin causing my breathing to quicken. His chest was so warm,a vitality transferring through his skin to my fingertips, sending an electric-like tremor through my body.

He leaned down to kiss me, wild yet tender. My lips parted under his guidance, and when our tongues met, I felt a flame shoot up from my abdomen. My hands moved involuntarily into his hair, fingers running through those surprisingly soft black strands, feeling the warmth of his scalp.


His hand slid to the hem of my blouse, fingertips lightly grazing the skin at my waist. The sensation nearly made me arch my back,an uncontrollable sigh escaping my throat.
"Let me look at you," Howard whispered, desire and tenderness coexisting

in his voice. His fingers moved with elegant precision, unbuttoning my clothes one by one, his movements slow and passionate, as if performing a sacred ritual. When my clothing fell completely open. I felt a chill and sudden shyness,instinctively wanting to cover myself.

"Don't," he said softly. gently stopping my movement. "Annie. Let me see all of you."

His gaze was so intense yet respectful that I felt a curious contradiction-both vulnerable and powerful.

Howard's lips left mine and began a mesmerizing journey of exploration.He started with light kisses on my chin, then slowly descended along the curve of my neck. When he reached my collarbone, his tongue traced that hollow, causing me to shiver all over. I involuntarily raised my hips,longing for more contact with him, a desire so intense it bordered on pain.
"What's the rush?" he murmured against my skin, the corner of his mouth lifting in a slight mischievous smile. "We have all night."
His right hand covered my breast, his thumb gently but firmly grazing the most sensitive peak. That simple action was enough to make my entire body tense, a moan escaping my lips beyond my control. His smile deepened, clearly satisfied with my response. He lowered his head,taking my nipple in his warm mouth, his tongue circling the areola, alternating between gentle and firm pressure, this rhythmic alternation nearly driving me mad.

Our clothes fell one by one to the floor until finally his naked body pressed completely against mine. The sensation of skin against skin was like an exquisite electric shock, radiating from our points of contact to every cell in my body. His body temperature was surprisingly high.reminding me of a fire in the dead of winter, and I was a moth willing to

fly into that heat.

My hands caressed his broad back, feeling the muscles contract and relax under my touch, that sense of power intoxicating.

Howard's fingers explored the most intimate and sensitive parts of my body, his movements precise and skillful, as if he instinctively knew how to please me. He first gently traced the outside, then gradually went deeper,finding the spot that drove me crazy. My breathing became broken and rapid, my hands unconsciously gripping his shoulders, nails digging into his skin.

"Do you like it?" he asked against my ear, his voice even deeper wwith desire.

I couldn't answer, only expressing my feelings through tightly closed eyes and increasingly heavy breathing. He seemed to understand my response,his fingers becoming more deliberate while his lips moved down my body,past my abdomen, and down to my inner thighs. His breath washed over my most sensitive area, the hot sensation making me tremble uncontrollably.

Then, unexpectedly, his tongue replaced his fingers, bringing an entirely different sensation. This wet heat made me arch my body, hands gripping the sheets tightly. His tongue moved skillfully back and forth, sometimes gently licking, sometimes forcefully sucking, keeping me suspended between ecstasy and torment.
"Howard..." I gasped his name, my voice unrecognizable with desire.

He looked up at me, his eyes shining with satisfaction and desire intertwined. "I'm here," he said, his voice gentle yet firm.""Ialways will be."

When he finally entered me, the feeling of completeness almost brought tears to my eyes. His initial movements were slow and controlled.giving me time to adjust to his presence. But soon, as my body relaxed and responded. his rhythm quickened. Each time he entered deeper, until I felt we were no longer two separate beings, the boundaries between souls and bodies blurring.

My legs wrapped around his waist, pulling him closer, desperately wanting to eliminate any possible distance between us. His movements became more powerful, each thrust eliciting a satisfied moan from me.

"Look at me." Howard whispered in my ear, his voice hoarse with passion yet still full of strength. I opened my eyes, meeting his profound gaze. In that moment. I felt a connection beyond the physical, a resonance at the soul level. The feeling was so intense that tears rolled from the corners of my eyes.

He leaned down to kiss away my tears, his movements becoming more fervent. He took my hands, intertwining our fingers tightly,pressing them against the bed on either side of my head. This position allowed him to penetrate deeper, hitting the most sensitive spot inside me.

Pleasure pierced through my body with a dizzying intensity. My fingers gripped the sheets so tightly I almost tore them. My toes curled from extreme pleasure, every muscle in my body tensed to its limit. Just when I thought I couldn't take any more, Howard held my hips firmly with both hands, tasting me even more deeply. His tongue skillfully circled my sensitive spot, sometimes gentle, sometimes forceful, this changing rhythm making it impossible to predict when the next wave of pleasure would come.

"Howard.,, stop... I can't..." I begged brokenly, my voice trembling with

desire.

But he didn't heed my plea, instead accelerating his rhythm. Wave after wave of pleasure swept through my entire body, like an endless storm,pushing me toward an even higher peak. When the climax finally came, its intensity nearly made me lose consciousness. My world became pure white light and electric cuarrent in that moment, the concepts of time and space completely disappeared, leaving only endless pleasure and satisfaction.

But Howard didn't stop. While I was still immersed in the afterglow of orgasm, he entered me again, this time with a slower, deeper rhythm. Each of his movements was deliberate and precise, continuously stimulating my sensitive inner walls that had just climaxed. The feeling was almost unbearable,between ecstasy and sweet torture.

Our eyes remained connected, each thrust like a silent vow. His fingers intertwined with mine, holding tight, as if this could bind our souls together too. In this intimacy, I felt an unprecedented connection, not just physical, but a resonance of souls.

As the rhythm gradually quickened, I felt myself climbing again to the peak of pleasure. This time, Howard reached climax with me,letting out a low growl as he slowly collapsed on top of me, his lower body still involuntarily shuddering, my hips also twisting violently, following his rhythm.

In the waves of pleasure, I held him tightly, feeling the perfect fit of our bodies and our pulses. When everything settled, he gently kissed my forehead and whispered, "I love you,Annie."
Those simple three words, in this moment, carried more weight than any elaborate vow. I rested my head on his chest, listening to his strong,steady heartbeat, thinking that this sound would accompany me through every

night for the rest of my life.

"I love you too. Howard," I responded softly, a promise I was willing to keep for a lifetime.

Outside, Manhattan's lights continued to twinkle, witnessing the beginning of our love. Lucy would return tomorrow, and we would officially begin our family life. But at this moment, in Howard's warm embrace, I had already found my home, found my belonging.

"Do you want to tell Lucy tomorrow?" I asked, my fingers lightly tracing circles on his chest.

"Of course," Howard answered, his voice deep with drowsiness. "Let's do it together."

I nodded, feeling a warm happiness rising from deep within. This was what I hadalways longed for-a real family, a family truly in love with each other. In Howard's arms, I finally understood what true security means, what unconditional acceptance and love feel like.

I closed my eyes, immersing myself in the perfection of this night,knowing tomorrow would bring a brand new beginning.



###Chapter 240: I'll Always Be By Your Side

Sarah's POV

I sat on the sofa, my nails rhythmically tapping against the edge of the coffee table, creating a subtle yet reassuring sound. Things with Howard wouldn't progress any further for now. I licked my dry lips as my thoughtsspun like a carousel through my current options.

Howard Thompson, that high-and-mighty tech CEO, had spoken to me ín that condescending tone, as if I were some insignificant character. My nail scraped a mark into the table surface.

Robert was basically a backup plan. Although I'd agreed to remarry him last time, that was only to give myself another escape route. If things fell through with both Philip and Howard, at least I'd have Robert as insurance.
But if his business revival plan failed, I certainly wouldn't waste time with a bankrupt ex-husband.

My gaze fell on the comic contract sitting on the coffee table, and I sighed.Philip Baker, the investor in my comic business. No matter what, I couldn't completely alienate him. Economically speaking,he remained my most stable support, especially given my pregnancy.
I bit my lower lip, recalling Philip's angry eyes today. That stupid Brian had seen through my tricks, and Philip actually blamed me for it? A sour feeling rose in my stomach, but I quickly calmed myself. Men are always like this-they need to be soothed, cared for, told "it's okay, you're right."
I stood up from the sofa and walked toward the kitchen, deciding I needed to take immediate action. Men think with their stomachs,and I knew exactly how to use that to my advantage.

Standing in the kitchen, I briefly considered cooking Philip's favorite dish myself-that pasta he always smiled contentedly at during our college days.My fingers tapped lightly on the cabinet as I considered. No,too much trouble. I shook my head and dialed for takeout, ordering several dishes he loved.


"Do you need a food bag?" the person on the phone asked.

"Yes, just a regular paper bag, not the one with the restaurant logo," I specifically instructed. Perfect-I could tell Philip I made everything myself,just like when we were together. This little lie would evoke his memories and lower his guard.

After placing the order, I gently stroked my slightly rounded abdomen.This child, regardless of whose it was, would be my most powerful bargaining chip.

"Max." I called to my son, who was playing video games, deliberately keeping my voice gentle,"Mom needs to go out for a while. Take care of yourself,okay?"

Max nodded absent-mindedly, his eyes never leaving the screen. Children are like that-accustomed to my comings and goings, accustomed to my schemes and lies.

The takeout arrived quickly, and I left carrying the food bag. Along the way, I contemplated tonight's strategy. Philip was dissatisfied with me,but I knew his weakness-he needed to feel needed, to be admired.His pathetic self-esteem was almost as useful as Howard's.

I arrived at Philip's apartment building, took a deep breath,ensuring my expression returned to that vulnerable state of needing rescue, then knocked on his door. No response. I knocked again, harder this time, my


knuckles slightly aching. While waiting. I rehearsed my opening lines in my mind, calculating how to penetrate Philip's defenses most efficiently.

When the door finally opened and Philip appeared, I quickly scanned his expression-tired, angry, surprised, and a hint of hidden expectation.Perfect.

"Have you eaten?" I asked softly, my voice half an octave lower than usual,fingers gently rubbing the edge of the food bag. I deliberately caressed my slightly swollen abdomen, making sure this action fell within Philip's line of sight, then carefully moved my gaze to his face, then away, displaying uncertainty and vulnerability.

"Do you know what time it is?" he asked, with less displeasure in his voice than I'd expected. I noticed his gaze involuntarily falling on my abdomen,just as I'd anticipated.

I naturally dropped my shoulders, exhaling: "I know it's late. It's just...I was at home thinking you might not have eaten, and I couldn't stop worrying." I deliberately made my voice quiver on the last few words, as if suppressing emotions, then raised my eyes to look directly at him: "Even though pregnancy makes me tired all day, I still wanted to make sure you ate something."

I saw the ice in Philip's eyes begin to melt, and my fingertips felt a small current of victory.

"Come in," he finally said,stepping aside.

Entering his apartment, I suppressed the urge to smile. Too easy-these self-important men, always so predictable. I knew what someone like Philip needed: not money,he had plenty of that; he needed care, needed someone to worry about him, just as Annie once had. I inwardly mocked

his patheticness, but my face showed only tenderness and concern.

"Let me help set the table." I said, naturally walking toward the kitchen.Out of his sight, I allowed my eyes to flash with smugness before resuming my worried expression.


I arranged the food on the dining table but sat down without touching anything,hands resting quietly on my lap. This posture was both submissive and expectant, as if waiting for instructions.

Philip glanced at me: "Aren't you eating?"

I shook my head slightly: "No need, I've already eaten." A small lie, but every lie has its purpose.

"It's too much for me alone," he said.

I hesitated briefly-not for show, but calculating the most natural response:"I'll have a little bit then. Don't want to waste food."

Serving myself a small bowl, I began eating slowly, occasionaly looking up to observe Philip. His gaze had softened, his thoughts seemingly drifting elsewhere. Now was the moment-his defenses were at their weakest, the perfect time for me to delve deeper.

"How did we end up like this?" Philip suddenly spoke, "In college, I truly loved you..."



###Chapter 241: I'll Always Be by Your Side Pa



Sarah's POV

"How did we end up like this?" Philip suddenly broke the silence,his voice hollow. "Back in college. I truly loved you..."

I feigned surprise, my fork suspended midair. "But I thought you said Annie was the one who pursued you?" I injected my tone with confusion and a hint of hurt, making my sincerity impossible to doubt.

Philip shook his head, his eyes reflecting nostalgia. "That wasn't true. In fact..." he paused, seemingly weighing his words, "Annie never pursued me. It was the opposite-I was the one constantly chasing her."

"Really?" I displayed just the right amount of surprise, my fingers frozen in mid-air as if stunned by this revelation.

"Yeah," Philip laughed softly, the sound laced with self-mockery. "Annie had just graduated then, completely absorbed in her illustration work. She'd barely spare me a glance."

I watched as his expression softened. "Unlike you, she wasn't outgoing or vivacious. She'd always sit quietly in the corner of the library,working on her illustrations. I deliberately chose seats near her just to be close."

"What happened next?" I asked softly, while mentally calculating the value of this information.

"Later... a senior made inappropriate comments to her, and I rushed to punch the guy. Ended up with broken ribs myself and spent a week in the hospital," Philip unconsciously touched his chest, as if the scar

remained. "Annie didn't visit me even once."

"Not only that," he continued, his voice dropping lower, "I once waited in the rain outside her apartment all night just to return a paintbrush she'd forgotten in my car. I planned a surprise birthday party for her, but she just said I was wasting money. And that time... I was driving her to meet a client and got into an accident. I nearly died..."

I nodded perfunctorily, maintaining an attentive facade while inwardly rolling my eyes. He droned on about ancient history,but at least his guard was down-that was good.

"Then why did she eventually end up with you?" I asked, deliberately adding curiosity and puzzlement to my voice, just to keep the conversation flowing.

Philip sighed. "I guess just because I persisted long enough."

I smirked inwardly. Just harassment dressed up as romance. These men always glorify their persistence as romantic when it's really just stalking.

"I wasn't a good person," he continued, voice low. "After winning her,I started... taking our relationship for granted."

As Philip described how he betrayed Annie's love, valuing only her appearance while ignoring her talent, I noticed his eyes growing moist.Perfect. A man's tears always signal complete defensive collapse.
"If not for me, Annie might be a successful illustrator now," Philip said,voice heavy with regret. "I pulled her off her path, then didn't cherish her."
I gently patted his hand, my eyes conveying tender understanding. "That's all in the past." The statement was both comfort and a test-to see if he still dwelled on what happened.

"Annie was so naive." Philip continued, tears now flowing freely. "It took less than six months to win her over. Those things I did for her, honestly,were just ways to cope after losing you. But she thought I loved her and stayed by my side for years, loving me without complaint." His voice began to shake. "Why was she so innocent? If she'd seen through me earlier, left sooner, she wouldn't have suffered so much."

He cried harder. Inwardly. I despised his tears, but outwardly, I could only offer comfort: "Maybe she realized early on but wanted to give you a chance because she loved you."

"But I never changed, did I?" Philip looked up, eyes red.

I remained silent-a silence more powerful than any words. Let him draw his own conclusions.

"When you came back into my life, I thought I still loved you..." he continued brokenly. "That's why I reconnected with you, despite you having Max. The time we spent together was enjoyable... but that was because Annie was still my wife. Had I known... that being with you would make me lose her... I would have controlled myself."

I nearly rolled my eyes but restrained the impulse. He was still deluding himself.

"Why did I wait until losing her to realize how much I loved her?" Philip asked,choking on his words.
I responded coolly: "Because when you were together, you were certain Annie loved you and would never leave. You knew she had no family or friends in New York. You believed that even if she wanted to go...she had nowhere to go."

Hearing this, Philip completely broke down, sflently sobbing on the couch.I mentally counted to ten before moving beside him, gently wrapping an arm around his shoulders.

"It's okay," I whispered in his ear, my voice silk-soft. "Annie doesn't want you anymore, but you still have me. I'll always stay by your side,never abandon you."

I felt his body relax under my touch. This sense of control intoxicated me.He lifted his head, uncertainty filling his swollen eyes: "Are you sure you're not lying to me?"

"Of course I'm sure," I answered without hesitation, fingers lightly stroking his hair. "How could I lie to you?"
When Philip collapsed completely in my arms, muttering "You're all I have now," I nearly laughed aloud. Instead, I embraced him tighter,displaying complete acceptance and affection.

"It's alright." I comforted Philip, my voice honey-sweet against his ear."I'll always be by your side."

As long as you remain useful, of course.



###Chapter 242: Damn That Woman!

Sarah's POV

The vibration of my phone buzzed like an annoying bee, persistently interrupting my sleep. I rolled over, pressing the silk pillow against my ear,trying to block out the irritating noise. But the vibration seemed to grow louder.carrying a relentless persistence.

"Damn it, what time is it?" I muttered, eyes still tightly shut. I reached for the nightstand, my fingers touching the cold screen of my phone.Blinking my stll-heavy eyelids. I looked at the screen and immediately felt all drowsiness vanish.

Hundreds of notifications flooded in like a tidal wave. Messages, emails,social media alerts-never had there been so many. My heartbeat accelerated, an inexplicable sense of unease crawling up my spine.Something had happened, and it was definitely not good.

I quickly unlocked my phone, and the first thing I saw was a photo:blurry figures of Philip and me at the entrance of an upscale restaurant.The comments beneath the photo hissed like venomous snakes:
"Look at this homewrecker, brazenly appearing in public."

"Does she know she destroyed a family?"

"This woman is disgusting."

My finger paused on the screen, my throat tightening. I quickly scrolled down, and the comments grew increasingly vicious, some even directly tagging my account. Others had taken snippets from my comic,quoting them out of context to prove my "moral corruption."


"Have these people lost their minds?" I cursed under my breath, a bitter taste in my throat. I got up to pour myself a glass of water, my hand shaking so badly that a few drops spilled onto my nightgown, the cold sensation slightly awakening me.

I continued browsing social media when suddenly, a financial news headline hit me like a punch to the gut:

"Investment Giant Philip Baker Caught in Personal Scandal, Company on Verge of Collapse"

My fingers froze, and I stood there as if struck by lightning. The brief summary beneath the headline mentioned "video of argument with 5-year-old son leaked," "investors withdrawing en masse," and "stock price plummeting 70%."

"Oh God..." I threw the phone onto the sofa as if it had suddenly become scorching hot. This wasn't just an ordinary father-son argument, but a fatal blow to Philip's core competency as a businessman and investor. I could imagine the reaction of those Wall Street investors watching this video-no one would entrust their funds to someone who could be easily manipulated by a 5-year-old child.

The phone rang sharply, piercing the silence of the room.Melissa,my editor. I took a deep breath, trying to make my voice sound calm and natural.


"Good morning,Melissa."

"Sarah," her voice was heavy as lead, "have you seen those comments online?"
"Just saw them," I replied casually, as if it were a trivial matter,"those


people just have too much time on their hands." I gathered my scattered hair, pacing back and forth in the living room, trying to mask my anxiety with movement.

"The problem is far worse than you think," Melissa sighed, "nearly all the pre-orders for our printed books have been canceled."

Those words struck my heart. I stopped in my tracks, my nails unconsciously digging into my palm. "What? That's impossible! Those bookstores can't do this, we have contracts!" The panic in my voice was now undisguisable.

"The bookstores are afraid of boycotts and are canceling orders. Online sales platforms are also receiving numerous complaints," Melissa's explanation felt like cold water poured over my head. "The publishing executives are in an emergency meeting, discussing whether to recall the books that have already been shipped..."

I hung up, feeling a fire burning in my chest. With heavy steps,I walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, overlooking Manhattan's streets. This city once gave me infinite hope, but now it felt like an enormous prison.I clenched my fists tightly, pressing my forehead against the cold glass.Everything I had carefully calculated had collapsed overnight.
"Damn it!" I slammed my fist on the windowsill, pain shooting through my knuckles, yet it couldn't compare to my frustration at having my plans disrupted.

My hand unconsciously moved to my swollen abdomen, this "insurance policy" might now be worthless. I had thought that with my career taking off, I wouldn't need to rely entirely on this child as leverage to control Philip. But now, Philip's assets were likely to shrink significantly, and how much benefit this child I was painstakingly carrying could bring me

remained unknown. Those investors no longer trusted him, how could I count on a man with such poor business judgment to provide the life I wanted?


I turned on the television, switching to the financial channel, hoping to learn more about Philip's company situation. Every channel seemed to be reporting this breaking news-Philip Baker's empire was crumbling.Financial experts predicted his company's stock price might continue to fall,clients were accelerating withdrawals, and the company's liquidity was in peril.

"Damn it. Philip!" I cursed, picking up my phone to dial his number. No answer. I dialed again. Still no answer. I began pacing back and forth,my fingers anxiously fidgeting with my hair. This once-confident investment tycoon was probably now hiding in some corner, afraid to face the harsh reality.


Suddenly,a thought struck me like lightning. I stopped in my tracks,standing in the middle of the living room, as if fixed in place by an invisible force.

Last night... why had Philip accepted me so easily last night? Why had he forgiven all my deceptions so quickly?

The desperation in his eyes as he looked at me then, almost begging me to stay: "You're all I have..."

Now I understood-he already knew his company was about to collapse.He needed an emotional pillar, even an economic one, a woman carrying his child to support his crumbling image and self-esteem.
"He was using me..." This realization made my stomach convulse.I stumbled onto the sofa, an unprecedented sense of humiliation wvashing


over me.

I, Sarah Johnson, the woman who best knew how to manipulate men in Manhattan's social circle, had actually been manipulated. I almost laughed out loud., but the laughter in my throat turned into a bitter sigh.

I had always been the user, never the used.

"This is fucking ridiculous!" I grabbed a cushion and hurled it at the wall,watching it helplessly slide to the floor.

But even as I harbored such resentment toward Philip, the deepest anger in my heart was directed at someone else.

I picked up my phone again, opening the online comic bestseller list. As I had expected. Annie Baker's new work firmly occupied the top spot, the comment section filled with praise and support:

"Annie Baker's work shows true artistic value..."

"An interesting and authentic story..."

"Look at this adorable art style and..."

My fingers tightly gripped the phone, almost crushing the screen. There were even more glaring comparisons:

"Look at the difference between the two, one is a talented artst,the other just relies on men to get ahead..."
I couldn't help but laugh on the sofa, but this laughter sounded like the howl of a wounded beast. Annie Baker.,. this name was like an ineradicable curse in my heart.
Images flashed through my mind: Annie's intimate interactions with

Howard in the park, Annie's satisfied smile while holding Lucy,the undisguised love in Howard's eyes when looking at Annie,. all of which should have belonged to me.

Howard Thompson could have provided me with everything-wealth,status, security. But this woman, seemingly gentle and harmless on the surface but actually shrewd and cunning, had taken him away. Now,she had also taken away my glory in my career.

I got up and walked to the bathroom, splashing cold water on my face.The woman in the mirror had sharp eyes, filled with determination.

"She must be manipulating everything behind the scenes," I whispered to the mirror. "Howard has enough influence to help her do all this."

Perhaps Annie had someone leak my relationship with Philip, perhaps she was behind this boycott campaign, perhaps she instructed Brianto argue with Philip and ensured the video was circulated...

Damn that woman!

I felt my heartbeat gradually stabilize. Calm down, Sarah, calm down. You need a new plan.

"Robert..." I softly uttered this name, my fingertips lightly tapping my thigh.

Robert seemed to be doing better recently. He had mentioned a project in collaboration with a major company. Most importantly, Robert still had indelible feelings for me, especially since I had agreed to his remarriage proposal.
This wasn't over yet.

I tidied my hair, picked up my phone, and dialed Robert's number. Taking a deep breath, the moment the call connected, I immediately made my voice carry just the right amount of tearfulness:

"Robert..." my voice trembled slightly, sounding fragile and desperate, "I need your help..."

###Chapter 243: On One Condition

Sarah's POV

The phone trembled slightly in my hand. not from nervousness, but from eagerness. If anyone could rescue me from my current predicament, it would be Robert. Though we were divorced, he had never truly escaped my shadow.

"What kind of help do you need. Sarah?" Robert's voice came through the line.

I adjusted my breathing slightly. preparing for my performance. Like countless times before. Robert could never resist a "vulnerable" me. I summoned years of practiced manipulation skills, adding just the right amount of tremor to my voice.

"Have you seen what they're saying about me online?" I deliberately let my voice catch with a small sob. "My career is ruined, Robert. All my hard work..."”

After a moment of silence, I heard keyboard tapping sounds-he was checking the comments. A good sign-he cared enough to immediately verify what I was saying.

I paced back and forth in my living room, watching my phone screen fill with increasingly vicious comments:

"She deserves to lose everything."

"No talent, just using men to get ahead."

"Who would support such a horrible person?"

These comments truly stung, but right now they were perfect props.

"I see," he finally responded. "It does look pretty bad."

"Bad?" I nearly choked on the word, my voice rising half an octave. "It's catastrophic! The publishing house is considering recalling my books, and all pre-orders are canceled. Do you understand what this means for my income?"

I deliberately collapsed onto the sofa, one hand protectively caressing my slightly rounded abdomen-a gesture that had softened Robert's heart every time in the past. He had an almost pathological obsession with children.one of my strongest bargaining chips.

"My project is just starting to gain traction," Robert said. "I can't risk getting involved in a scandal right now. Investors are cautious enough as it is."

This answer wasn't quite what I expected, but I wasn't worried.Men always do this-offering token resistance to appear less eager. Just the first step in negotiations.

"But..." my voice quavered,"I thought you said you wanted us to be a family again. You proposed remarriage, Robert."
"Yes, I did. But that was before all this. I've been thinking that rushing back into marriage when my business is still so unstable... it would be irresponsible,"

My fingers curled into fists, nails digging into my palms. The timing was too convenient, his change of attitude too abrupt. Just days ago, he was begging me to return to him, and now-when I truly needed him-he was backing away?

"Is that really it?" I asked, struggling to keep accusation from my voice."Or is it because I've suddenly become a liability? Because my reputation might damage your precious new project?"

The silence on the other end made me increasingly uneasy. I took a deep breath, rapidly calculating in my mind. A hardline approach clearly wouldn't work. I needed to appeal to his emotions.

I lowered my voice, deliberately making my tone soft and nostalgic."Remember our early days? When we'd watch the sunrise and sunset together, whispering to each other on the beach?"

"We were happoy then, weren't we? Before everything got complicated. Just you,me,and our dreams."

"Sarah-" he began. He was taking the bait. I couldn't help but smirk as I continued. Now was the perfect time to sway him.

"Now I'm carrying your child," I whispered, my voice breaking perfectly."Our second child, Robert. Max's little brother or sister. You know, he asks about you. Wants to know why his daddy doesn't live with us anymore."

The silence that followed made me smile inwardly. This trick had never failed. Robert's longing for family was so intense that he softened every time I mentioned the word "family." I could almost picture him now.holding the phone, tears in his eyes. Like countless times before,he would agree to whatever I wanted. The man was so predictable.
His initial resistance was just a façade, a self-protective measure after being hurt. And now, like a skilled angler, I could feel the fish beginning to bite.Just one more gentle puIl...
"I'll help you, but on one condition," he said.

My heart raced, but I remained confident. Whatever condition he set.I could handle it. Perhaps a public apology, perhaps more time with Max.All within my expectations,all manageable.

"Anything," I replied easily, already thinking of how to minimize any potential concessions.


"Give me custody of Max."

Robert, are you insane? I gasped, genuinely shocked. Max? My bargaining chip? My insurance? Are you dreaming?

"What? You can't be serious-" My voice suddenly lost its carefully crafted steadiness. genuine shock making me forget my performance.

"Im completely serious," he interrupted. "If you want my help, Max needs to live with me. Full custody, Sarah. That's my condition."

I stood motionless, my mind racing. This wasn't the Robert I knew, the Robert who would rush to the ends of the earth for a single call from me.How dare he make such a demand? Max had always been my strongest leverage, my most reliable source of steady economic support. Through Max. I could ensure Robert would provide financial support forever.Giving him up was unthinkable.

"This is absurd," I stammered, forgetting my composed façade. "What about me? What am I supposed to do?"

Robert chuckled. "That's the first honest question you've asked this entire conversation. 'What about me?' That's always been your primary concern,hasn't it,Sarah?"

His words sent a wave of unease through me. A terrible suspicion began forming in my mind.

"Robert." I said carefully, trying to regain control, "what exactly do you mean?"


"I mean I've been testing you,Sarah."

"Testing me?" I repeated, confusion and anger battling within me. This wasn't how our game was played. I was the one who set tests, who manipulated situations. "What does that mean?"

His declaration was followed by a deafening silence, broken only by distant traffic sounds from the street and the roar of my own heartbeat in my ears.

"You." I repeated, my voice dropping to a dangerous whisper,desperately clinging to my last shred of control, "saying 'testing me' means what exactly?"

###Chapter 244: The Test

Sarah's POV

"You." I repeated, my voice dropping to a dangerous whisper, desperately clinging to my last shred of control, "saying 'testing me' means what exactly?"

Silence.Robert didn't immediately respond, only his faint breathing on the line reminded me he was still there. I waited anxiously,feeling each second stretch into eternity.

My mind raced through possibilities: Perhaps he was unhappy with Max's recent report card? Or because I'd brought Max home late from social events a few times? Maybe he'd heard about my situation with Philip and was concerned about its impact on Max?

As the silence extended, my hand unconsciously moved to my slightly rounded abdomen. If I lost Max, I'd lose my guarantee that Robert would provide financial support forever. The thought sent a wave of panic through me.

I consoled myself: "He can't be serious. Robert is far too busy with work to actually want custody of Max. He's just testing my attitude toward our son."This self-reassurance slightly relaxed my tense nerves.
I realized my earlier reaction had been too intense. Negotiating with Robert had always required strategy-being too aggressive would only backfire.I needed to appear gentler, more sincere,to make him feel my maternal love.
"I'm sorry, Robert," I said softly, deliberately adding vulnerability and remorse to my voice, "I shouldn't have reacted that way. It's just.,.you know how important Max is to me. He's my everything, the product of our

love. I guess I'm just terrified of losing him."

Still silence from the other end. Time ticked by, and my unease deepened.Finally. Robert spoke-not with an answer, but with a laugh.

That laugh sent chills through mny body, my stomach feeling like it had been punched. My heart rate instantly accelerated, fine beads of sweat forming on my forehead.

Before I could respond, the line went dead.

I stared at my phone screen in disbelief, my fingers beginning to tremble slightly. Heat rushed to my head, my cheeks burning. I violently threw my phone onto the sofa, biting my lower lip until I tasted blood.

"Bastard!" I cursed under my breath, my voice hoarse with anger. "How dare you treat me like this?"

I never allowed anyone to hang up on me, especially not Robert, that weak man. For years, he'd been the most obedient puppet in my hands-my tears could make him beg for forgiveness, my smile could make him give me everything. Now he dared to humiliate me like this?

I rose to pace around the living room, breathing fast and heavy, my right hand constantly fixing my hair, my left hand pressed firmly against my abdomen. My mind replayed our conversation, searching for my error.
No,something must have happened that I wasn't aware of. Robert didn't have the courage to plan such defiance alone. Someone must be pulling strings behind the scenes, someone must be helping him.
This sudden loss of control made me clench my fists, knuckles turning white. I was once a celebrated star, an envied winner, the brightest presence in New York high society. I would not allow myself to become

anyone's laughingstock.

Taking a deep breath. I tried to compose myself. Now was not the time to fall apart. I needed to think, needed a new plan.

I walked to the sofa, retrieved my phone, checking it for damage. When I unlocked the screen, a notification appeared-a message from Howard's private account:

"I told you, it's been a test all along."

My blood instantly froze. My fingers trembled uncontrollably as I stared at the message, trying to understand the connection. Was this coincidence or something more sinister?

"Howard must be with Robert," I muttered, piecing together a theory."They're probably discussing that Howard Technologies project. This can't be..."

I carefully replied: "Howard? I'm not sure I understand what you mean.What test are you referring to?"

Almost immediately, the phone rang-Howard's private number flashing on the screen. A strange premonition accelerated my heartbeat. I took a deep breath, composed myself, and answered.
"Hello,Howard," I said, deliberately making my voice warm and intimate.

"Not Howard," came Robert's voice from the other end.

I checked my screen again-it definitely showed Howard's private account calling. This confirmed my earlier suspicion that Howard and Robert were together. But why was Robert using Howard's phone?

"Damn Robert," I cursed inwardly, "you're bringing personal matters to Howard? Trying to show him you have a backbone? Pathetic."

I took a deep breath,reassuring myself this was just a momentary impulse from Robert. Robert was still under my control, he just needed a little stimulation to prove his existence.

"Robert?" I kept my voice gentle, "Why are you using Howard's phone?What's going on?"

"No games, Sarah." Robert's voice was terrifyingly calm. "It's finally time to reveal the truth."


My fingers gripped the sofa armrest tightly, knuckles turning white."What does that mean?"

"The person messaging you has never been Howard," Robert explained, his voice steady and cold. "It's been me all along."

The world tilted beneath my feet. I sat down on the sofa, feeling nauseous."That's impossible. You're lying."

"Am I?" he challenged, "Think about it, Sarah. After your initial interaction,did you ever actually meet 'Howard' in person? Or was it all just messages and calls?"

Impossible. Absolutely impossible.

I felt my cheeks burning, my lips numb with shock.

"You must be joking," I managed to say, my throat feeling like something was lodged in it.
"Remember when you tried to set me up to attack Annie?" Robert's voice

hardened, each word cutting like a blade. "Your little scheme failed because Annie saved me from making the biggest mistake of my life."

My nails dug deep into my palms. Annie Baker. Always her.

"You're misunderstanding me," I forced my voice to remain steady, "I was only trying to help you two reconnect..."

"Save it, Sarah," he interrupted, his voice carrying unprecedented determination. "Annie told Howard everything. When Howard decided to invest in my new project, he had one condition-that I create this account to communicate with you, to see your true face."

My heart pounded violently, as if trying to break through my chest. "You've been spying on me?" My voice rose with anger.

"No. Sarah. I've been watching you expose yourself. How you tried to manipulate 'Howard' while keeping Philip on a string. How you used our unborn child as leverage. How you talked about Annie..."

Nausea rose in my throat. Every message I'd sent to "Howard," every calculated word, every manipulation attempt-all had been read by Robert.Not only that, but those private complaints, the disparagement of Annie,the schemes against Philip... everything had been exposed to Robert.
"You disgust me," Robert said calmly, "I now see the real you-not the facade you put on when you want something from me."

I closed my eyes. This couldn't be happening.

"My condition stands," Robert interrupted me, his voice as firm as iron. "If you want my help with your current situation, I get full custody of Max."
A panic I'd never experienced before seized my heart, "You can't do this,

you have no right! Max is my son!"

"He's my son too," Robert responded calmly.

The line went dead, and I sat motionless on the sofa,trembling all over.My career was in shambles. Philip's company was collapsing, Robert had seen through my manipulations, and Howard-the real Howard-was completely out of my reach.

This can't be real. Robert couldn't have deceived me like this. Using a fake Howard account to monitor me? Another wave of nausea hit me, and I covered my mouth, forcing myself not to throw up. All those messages I'd sent to "Howard"-my clever manipulations, my mockery of Annie,my complaints about Philip-Robert had seen it all.

I felt naked.humiliated, betrayed. Robert, once so docile and obedient.Robert who I could bend to my will, had set such a trap?

How dare he! How dare he! My nails dug into the flesh of my palms, with enough force to nearly draw blood.

Someone must be helping him behind the scenes.

"This is all Annie's fault," I hissed, no longer able to control my emotions,"She must have orchestrated all of this! She's just jealous of my relationship with Philip,jealous of my talent, jealous of me..."
It must be her. Annie, this time, I won't let you get away with it!

###Chapter 245: Some Secrets Aren't Ready to be Shared

Howard's POV

Monday evening at seven. Lucy returned to my Long Island mansion after spending the weekend with the Parkers and her friend Penny. I was surprised by how much I had missed the little one after just a weekend apart.

"Daddy!" Lucy ran toward me the moment she spotted me, wrapping her arms around my legs. Her golden head tilted back, blue eyes sparkling with excitement.

I crouched down and lifted her into my arms. "Did you have fun?"

"It was awesome!" She wiggled excitedly. "Penny and I went to the aquarium and saw so many fish! There was a shark this big-" she stretched her small arms wide, "it almost bit me!"

"Really?" I raised an eyebrow, recognizing her childish exaggeration.

Annie emerged from the kitchen wearing simple loungewear that somehow still made my heart skip a beat. Lucy immediately squirmed out of my arms and flew toward Annie like a small bird.

"Mommy!" she cheered, throwing herself into Annie's arms. "I missed you!"

"I missed you too, sweetheart." Annie's voice was velvet-soft as she caught Lucy and kissed her forehead. The sight filled my chest with warmth.
The Parkers-Lucy's maternal grandparents-seemed more relaxed since accepting Annie's presence. They were staying in my guest room

temporarily, which delighted Lucy, giving her more time with her grandparents.

"We took Lucy and Penny to the aquarium," Edward Parker smiled. "The girls had a wonderful timne."

"Yes," Eleanor added gently, "Lucy is such a good child. We enjoy spending time with her."

"We'll head upstairs to unpack," Edward said. "We have some matters to attend to tomorrow."


After they went upstairs. Lucy pulled Annie to the sofa, eager to continue sharing her adventures.

"Then Penny said she wants to be an actress when she grows up!" Lucy chattered while sitting on Annie's lap. "I told her I could draw comics for her! Just like you, Mommy!"

I sat across from them, my heart racing. Tonight was when Annie and I had agreed to talk with Lucy. Looking at them together,I knew I wanted this to be my everyday reality for the rest of my life.

With the Parkers upstairs, only the three of us remained in the living room.
Lucy was still enthusiastically recounting her weekend, but my thoughts had already drifted to our upcoming conversation.
"Lucy," I began when she paused to take a sip of water, "Annie and I have something we'd like to discuss with you."
Lucy immediately quieted, her eyes widening. Children are always sensitive to phrases like "we need to talk."
"Is it something bad?" she asked nervously.

"No. of course not," Annie reassured her gently. "It's just something we'd like your opinion on."

I took a deep breath, held Annie's hand, and drew strength from her gentle squeeze.


"Lucy," I said as calmly as possible, "you know Annie and I love each other very much,right?"

Lucy nodded solemnly, wearing an expression that said this was obvious.

"We're thinking about getting married," I stated directly, "but we wanted to hear your thoughts first. If you don't want us to get married, we won't."

Lucy's brow furrowed immediately, her mouth opening slightly,seemingly surprised by how seriously we were taking her opinion.
"What would be different if you got married?" she asked,sounding confused.

I explained patiently: "Legally, Annie would become my wife and officially your stepmother. You already call her 'Mommy,' but after marriage,this title would be legally recognized."
Lucy fell silent, her small hands nervously fidgeting with the hem of her dress. Her brow furrowed slightly as her eyes moved between Annie and me,considering something important.
"Mommy," Lucy finally spoke, her voice softer than usual, "can I talk to Daddy alone?"
This request surprised both of us. Annie glanced at me, then nodded gently to Lucy: "Of course,sweetheart."

I took Lucy's hand and led her to my study, closing the door softly.She looked nervous, which made my heart clench.

"What is it. angel?" I knelt down to meet her at eye level.

Lucy stared at the floor, her voice almost a whisper: "If you marry Mommy,will you still be nice to me?"

A sharp pain shot through my chest as I immediately understood her concern. "Lucy, look at me," I gently lifted her chin. "I love you. You are my daughter. That will never change."

"You won't take Mommy away from me?" Her straightforward question made me feel both amused and tenderly concerned.

Truthfully, I sometimes secretly "jealous," wishing I could have more of Annie's time. But looking at Lucy's serious little face, I knew what she needed was honesty and reassurance.

"No," I shook my head firmly, a slight smile playing at my lips. "To be honest, sometimes I also want to keep Mommy all to myself. But Annie has enough love for both of us. Getting married will only make the three of us a happier family. But if you're uncomfortable,we can wait-"

"I need to think about it," she interrupted. "It's a big decision."

I couldn't help smiling; her occasional maturity always surprised me. "Of course, little one. Take your time. No one will rush you."
We returned to the living room where Annie looked at us expectantly, but I shook my head slightly to indicate we didn't have an answer yet. Lucy went to Annie and tugged at her sleeve.
"Mommy, can I seep with you tonight?" she asked timidly.

I instinctively tightened my grip on Annie's hand, subtly indicating my objection. Since confirming our relationship, spending each night with Annie had become something I looked forward to. But Annie just smiled gently.ignoring my small gesture.

"Of course, sweetheart." she said. "We'll sleep together."

Lucy's expression immediately brightened, and she skipped upstairs to prepare for her bath. Annie turned to me,her eyes filled with apology and understanding.

"Give her some time," she said softly, squeezing my hand. "She just needs security."

I nodded, pulling Annie closer to feel her warmth. "I know. Her feelings are most important. We're not in a rush." I kissed her forehead. "After all.I've waited this long-what's a little longer?"

Annie raised an eyebrow. "Waited this long?"

I quickly changed the subject: "I mean, after being a single father for so many years, waiting a bit longer is no problem."

Annie looked at me thoughtfully, as if wanting to ask something more, but ultimately just smiled and shook her head. I secretly felt relieved she didn't pursue it-some secrets weren't ready to be shared yet.
Watching Annie go upstairs to be with Lucy, I stood in the center of the living room, my heart full of anticipation for the future. Whatever Lucy decided, the three of us were already a family, and that would never change.

###Chapter 246: Lucy's Concerns

Annie's POV

The house was quiet in the late evening, filled only with gentle breathing and the distant sound of waves kissing the Long Island shore. Lucy's golden hair spread across the pillow like a spring creek catching the last rays of sunlight. She patted the space beside her, her deep blue eyes twinkling with expectation. As I lay down next to her, she nestled against me, her small hand absently playing with the hem of my nightgown.

The room was bathed in the soft glow of her unicorn night light,casting gentle shadows on the walls adorned with her artwork. Her drawings had improved dramatically in recent months-stick figures gaining detail,houses acquiring windows and chimneys, and smiles appearing on previously expressionless faces.Howard had proudly framed each new creation,treating them like masterpieces worthy of the Met.

"Lucy, I want to talk about what we discussed earlier," I began softly, my fingers combing through her silky hair. "About your dad and me possibly getting married."

I felt her body stiffen slightly in my arms, sensing her hesitation.Her small fingers stopped fidgeting with my nightgown and instead clutched it tightly.

"How do you feel about it?" I asked. "If you're uncomfortable or have any concerns,you can tell me. Your feelings matter the most to us."
Lucy remained silent for a moment, her eyes fixed on the window.Manhattan's nightscape was barely visible outside, distant buildings reduced to dark silhouettes against the night sky, twinkling lights like earthbound stars.

"It's not that I don't like you getting married," she finally said, her voice small but steady. "Tm just a little scared."

"Scared of what, sweetheart?" I asked gently,feeling the unease deep within her.


She looked up. tears glistening in her eyes like tiny diamonds. "I didn't come from Daddy's tummy, and I didn't come from yours either. If you get married and have a baby, will you forget about me?"

Hearing such worries from her five-year-old lips made my heart clench painfully. This wasn't just a child's casual concern about the future, but a real fear from a little girl who had already experienced profound loss. The yacht accident that claimed her parents had left invisible scars that occasionally surfaced in moments like this. I pulled her closer, feeling her tiny heart beating nervously against mine.

"Why didn't you tell your dad about these worries?" I stroked her back,asking softly, feeling each small vertebra beneath may fingers.

"Daddy would say I'm being silly," she wrinkled her little nose,burying her face in the crook of my neck. The scent of her strawberry shampoo mingled with the clean smell of freshly laundered pajamas. "He always says I'm so smart and mature compared to other kids. But sometimes I still get scared,you know."

I glanced at the family portrait hanging on Lucy's bedroom wall-a drawing she had made herself, with three stick figures holding hands in front of a house with a chimney releasing curls of smoke. The tallest figure was labeled "Daddy," the middle one "Mommy" (meaning me), and the smallest "Lucy." The three of us stood beneath a bright yellow sun, our stick arms connected in an unbroken chain.

"Lucy, let me ask you something," I said, shifting slightly to see her expression better. "Has your dad ever loved you less because you didn't come from his tummy?"


"Of course not!" She immediately looked up, her eyes wide with indignation. "Daddy loves me so much! After Mommy and Daddy went to the stars. I didn't want to talk to anyone, but Daddy slept next to me every night. When I woke up crying from nightmares, he always held me."She gesticulated with her small hands, pantomiming Howard's protective embrace. "His friends all said he stopped working,but Daddy didn't listen to them at all."

Her tiny hands unconsciously gripped my nightgown again,twisting the fabric into little bunches. "Daddy told me many times that his work isn't as important as Lucy! Even when those important people in suits come to our house, he always makes sure I'm okay first."

Looking at this golden-haired little girl, I suddenly understood the source of that deep protectiveness in Howard's eyes. Lucy wasn't just his brother's orphaned child; she was the person who had redefined the meaning of life for a man who once only pursued business success. Before her, Howard had been known as Manhattan's most eligible bachelor, focused entirely on building his empire. Now, he was first and foremost Lucy's father.

"You know, Lucy," I adjusted my position so we were face to face, our noses almost touching, "sometimes family isn't about who gave birth to whom,but about the people we choose to love. No matter what happens in the future, whether your dad has other children or not, you'll always be special to him. You taught him how to be a father, and that's something no one can ever take away."
The waves from Long Island gently lapped against the shore outside,like

the whispers of time passing. Lucy's expression gradually shifted from worry to calm, like the sea after a storm. Her breathing slowed,and the tension in her small shoulders began to melt away.

"Really?" She nodded, the corners of her mouth turning up slightly. "Actually, I really want you to marry Daddy. Then we'd really be a family!Penny says when grown-ups get married, there's cake and pretty dresses,and everyone dances."

"We already are a family," I kissed her forehead, feeling its smooth warmth against my lips. "A piece of paper doesn't decide whether we're a family or not. But you're right-it would make your dad very happy. And yes.there would definitely be cake."

"What about you?" She tilted her head curiously, her small finger pointing at my face with childlike directness. "Would it make you super happy too?As happy as when you finish drawing a really good picture?"

I didn't answer immediately, my thoughts drifting back to the diagnosis I received months ago-after that miscarriage, I might never be able to conceive again.

"It would make me very happy," I finally answered, from the bottom of my heart. "Being with you two is the happiest thing in my life. Even happier than finishing the best drawing ever."

Lucy smiled contentedly, adjusting her position in my arms. "Mommy,I'm not scared anymore. Can you sing me a sleep song? Like the one Penny's mom sings to her."

So I softly hummed the song my mother used to sing to me in childhood,about oceans, stars, and love that never fades. Lucy's breathing gradually became even, though her small fingers still held mine tightly.Looking at

her peaceful sleeping face, the gentle rise and fall of her chest.I silently made a promise: no matter what storms came. I would protect this child and our family.

Outside, stars dotted the nighat sky. I recalled Howard's meaningful words earlier-"I've waited this long"-and wondered how many stories he had yet to tell me. But none of that mattered now, because we had all the time in the world to weave the future that belonged to the three of us.

###Chapter 247: The Unforgettable First Love

Philip's POV

I stared at the real-time stock price chart on mny computer screen, watching the numbers continue their relentless descent. Since the leak of my argument with Brian, my investment company's stock had plummeted by 70%.


"Damn it," I muttered, rubbing my temples as a dull ache spread through my head. The exhaustion of being nearly sleepless was taking its toll.I had once been among Wall Street's shrewdest investors, now completely undone by a video featuring a five-year-old.

Clients were withdrawing their investments en masse, board members were demanding emergency meetings, and reporters were swarming the lobby awaiting my response. Everything had happened so quickly that I hadn't fully processed the collapse of my empire.

My assistant knocked gently before entering, handing me a prepared crisis management plan and the latest financial reports. Concern was written all over her face.

"Mr. Baker, reporters are waiting in the lobby. The board meets in thirty minutes."

I nodded, gesturing for her to leave. I needed a moment to gather my thoughts. Just as the door closed, my phone rang. Allen Stark's name flashed on the screen.
"Allen, this isn't a good time," I answered tersely.

"Don't hang up, Philip!" Allen's voice came through with unusual

excitement, "I found the information you wanted! About Howard Thompson's college sweetheart, the woman he could never forget."

That immediately captured my attention. The company crisis, board meeting,waiting reporters-everything suddenly seemed insignificant.I'd almost forgotten I'd asked Allen to investigate Howard's past, hoping to find something I could leverage. This information couldn't have come at a better time.


"Go on, I'm listening," I replied, my voice calming as I leaned back in my chair, feeling a glimmer of hope.

"This woman came from a single-parent household in Boston," Allen began sharing his findings. "Things got complicated after her father remarried. The stepmother had a daughter who performed poorly in school,while Howard's first love was an exceptional student."

"Continue," I unconsciously drummed my fingers on the desk.

"The school often inadvertently compared the two girls, which embarrassed the stepmother, making her feel her parenting was being questioned. She started spreading rumors at school, claiming the girl's good grades were obtined through improper means."

I could imagine the scene. I recalled Annie mentioning her school days weren't pleasant, though she never elaborated on why.

"This led to people at school looking at her differently,some even bullying her," Allen continued. "But what's most surprising was her reaction-she remained completely unfazed and focused on her studies. She understood education was her only ticket to a better life."
My thoughts drifted to Annie. She too camne from a single-parent home,


raised by her mother after her father died in a car accident. She never mentioned a stepmother, but she had emphasized the importance of education multiple times. This similarity made me uneasy.

"What happened to her?" I asked, gripping my pen tightly.

"The school invited her to give the honors student speech because of her outstanding performance. But under pressure from his new wife, her father demanded the school give the speaking opportunity to the stepsister.


"That's outrageous," I frowned, instinctively feeling angry for the girl.

"Yes. The school eventually caved and changed the speaker. Worse still,on the day of the speech, the stepsister publicly humiliated her.She reported it to the school, but no one helped-everyone just told her to let it go."

I clutched the phone, feeling a wave of discomfort. Annie had also mentioned a school speech once, and though she'd downplayed it, I remembered the momentary darkness that crossed her eyes.

"Finally, she applied for a transfer, and the administration claimed leaving their school would ruin her future," Allen's voice pulled me back to reality."But not only did she continue to excel, she helped other students at her new school improve. Within two years, her new school surpassed her former one in Ivy League acceptance rates."
The story sounded like a legend, but it also sent a chill through me.These details...they were too familiar.
"I also found out she worked as a coluimn illustrator during college," Allen continued. "Those works can still be found in old magazines at the library.Howard attended the same university, and rumor has it he's kept some of

her work all these years."

lllustrator. My heart raced. Annie was an illustrator too, her talent undeniable. This couldn't be coincidence.

"Allen.send me everything you have," I said urgently.

"No problem." he agreed. but then asked, "What do you plan to do with this information?"


I paused. weighing my response: "Howard clearly can't forget his college sweetheart. Annie should know she's just a replacement."

Allen seemed hesitant on the other end but finally said, "I'll compile everything and send it to you."

After hanging up, my thoughts were in turmoil. Could Annie be the first love Howard couldn't forget? No, impossible. If that were the case, they would have recognized each other long ago. Perhaps it was just coincidence, maybe Howard simply preferred this type of woman-intelligent,resilient,artistically gifted.

But if Annie truly was Howard's college sweetheart, and they were now pretending not to know each other... The idea was absurd. I shook my head, trying to dispel it. Regardless, this information could be useful.I could show Annie that Howard was obsessed with his past love, make her realize she was merely a substitute. Perhaps that would destabilize their relationship.

As I contemplated how to use this information, my phone rang again.Sarah Johnson's name appeared on the screen. I hesitated,then answered.
"Sarah?"

"Philip. I need to see you," her voice sounded both determined and urgent.
"I have a plan, but I need your help."

"What plan?" I asked, somewhat wary.

Another plan was forming in my mind too-using Howard's first love information to sabotage his relationship with Annie.

Despite the company crisis. I felt a new determination rising.I,Philip Baker, wasn't defeated yet. I woud find a way to turn everything around and reclaim what was rightfully mine-Annie.

###Chapter 248: The Last Struggle

Philip's POV

I stared at my phone screen, Sarah's name and the call duration still flashing. Her voice echoed in my ears: "Philip, I need to see you. I have a plan,but I need your help."

"What plan?" I asked, hearing the caution and suspicion in my own voice.

"Can't say over the phone," Sarah lowered her voice, that mysteriously enticing tone tat once sparked my curiosity. "We need to talk in person.It concerns Annie and Howard."

Annie and Howard. Those two names cut into my chest like a knife,slow and deep. I unconsciously rubbed my temples, closing my eyes. The events of the past few weeks flashed through my mind like a carousel-every time, every single time I believed Sarah's words, the result was always catastrophic.

Stock prices down 70%, clients withdrawing investments, board members demanding emergency meetings, reporters swarming the building lobby like hungry wolves waiting to tear apart my response-all because I blindly trusted Sarah's lies. How could I have been so incredibly stupid?

"I need time to think," I finally said, fingers unconsciously tapping an irregular rhythm on my desk. "I'll contact you later."
After hanging up, I turned to my computer screen. Allen's materials were displayed before me-Howard Thompson's college sweetheart. Photos,article clippings, award records, even scans of hand-drawn illustrations.
My heart raced. "This can't just be coincidence," I muttered,eyes fixed on



the dates and timeline. My mind worked rapidly. If I could use this information to make Annie realize she was merely a substitute for Howard's past love, perhaps I could still salvage everything? Maybe she would understand that Howard's so-called "love" was nothing but a projection of his past?


I picked up my phone, instinctively wanting to call Annie, only to discover I'd been blocked. This small detail sent a stab of pain through my chest.Once, I was the first to know her every emotion. Now, I'd been denied even the most basic means of contact.

I let out a cold laugh and sent her a brief email instead:

"Need to talk. Important information about Howard. Noon, restaurant below Howard's company building. If you don't come, I'll go directly to Howard."

The moment I hit send, I felt like I was tossing my last coin. My thumb caressed the phone screen, and for some reason, I visualized Annie sitting in the library corner, focused on her drawings-when she didn't know me yet,her gaze pure and concentrated.

Half an hour later, a short reply appeared in my inbox:

"Only 5 minutes. 12 o'clock sharp."

Five minutes. A wife of years now willing to give me only five minutes.I smiled bitterly, my throat tightening.
I arrived at the restaurant thirty minutes early, choosing a window seat.From this angle, I could clearly see everyone entering and exiting, as well as the entrance to Howard's building. I ordered two coffees.
I kept checking the time, each minute stretching like a century. I arranged

the folder I'd brought, fingers lightly tapping the table, remembering our first meeting. I had been recommended as a model for Annie at the library.and when she looked up, her focused eyes made my heart skip a beat.

At exactly noon. Annie appeared at the restaurant entrance. She wore a simple white shirt and dark straight-leg pants, hair casually tied back,looking both natural and professional. I noticed the fatigue on her face,but her eyes sparkled with a determination and indifference I'd never seen before. On her wrist was an elegant watch that I immediately recognized as Howard's brand-this small detail pierced my heart like a fine needle.

She approached my table, her steps confident and light.

"You have 5 mninutes," Annie stood at the table, not even sitting down. She glanced at her watch. "Starting now."

"At least sit down to talk," I gestured, my voice carrying a barely perceptible plea.

"No need," Annie said coolly. "Get to the point."

I took a deep breath and went straight to the subject: "Did you know Howard had a girlfriend in college? Someone he still can't forget."

Annie's expression didn't change at all; she just looked at me calmly,a calmness that almost drove me mad. "So what? Most people have a past.Time moves on,Philip."

Time moves on. Four simple words that cut through my heart like a blade.She had moved forward, while I remained trapped in past illusions.
"The issue isn't that he has a past," I pushed a folder across the table, my knuckles unnaturally white. "It's that you might just be a substitute for that woman."

Annie didn't immediately open the folder but looked directly into my eyes:"You called me here just for this? To tell me Howard has an ex-girlfriend?"

A wave of irritation surged through me. Why couldn't she just look at the materials?Why couldn't she understand my concerns?

"Not just an ex-girlfriend." I emphasized, my voice slightly raised, feeling like a desperate lawyer trying to convince a jury. "An unforgettable first love. Look at these materials-also from a single-parent household, also an illustrator, also experienced unfair treatment at school..."

Annie opened the folder, casually scanning the contents. I watched her expression intently. expecting to see shock, confusion, or at least a hint of doubt, but Annie's eyes showed only indifference, as though reading an unimportant newspaper. She even yawned slightly, that dismissive attitude cutting into my self-esteem like a dull knife.

"I'm serious,Annie," I continued, my voice unconsciously taking on a pleading tone. "Howard's feelings for you might not be as pure as you imagine. Look at these similarities-don't you find it strange? You might just be..."

"A substitute?" Annie finished my sentence, eyebrows slightly raised."Philip, do you think I would question my relationship because of a few blurry old photos and some far-fetched coincidences?"

She closed the folder and gently pushed it back to me, a confident smile I'd never seen during our marriage playing at her lips. "You called me out for this? Philip, are youtoo idle these days? Don't you have enough company issues to deal with?"
I felt a burning in my chest, my lungs filling with lead. I'd had enough of being belittled, ignored,treated as a pathetic ex-husband.


"Don't you understand?" I lowered my voice but couldn't hide the urgency."If Howard's first love suddenly appeared, he might abandon you immediately!"


Annie's eyes suddenly flashed with pity, which was harder to bear than her indifference. "Philip, even if Howard left me tomorrow, I wouldn't return to you. That marriage is over, completely over."

Her words felt like a cold knife in my chest. I felt dizzy, Annie's face blurring before me.

"Remember, this isn't your business," Annie continued, her voice calm and firm."Second. Howard and I have decided to get married. We've discussed it. and Lucy has agreed."

Married. The word hit my stomach like a heavy punch, instantly robbing me of breath. I felt nauseous, as if someone had tied a knot in my intestines. Blood drained from my face, the coffee cup trembling uncontrollably in my hand.

"Married?" I repeated, my voice so hoarse it was barely recognizable. "You and Howard are getting married?"

"Yes," Annie checked her watch. "Your 5 minutes are up. If there's nothing else, I need to get back to work."

I sat there, completely shattered by this news, I watched Annie leave the restaurant, her figure upright and determined, her steps light as if she'd shed some burden.
Back in my office, I closed the door, leaned against it, and took deep breaths like a drowning man just rescued from water. Annie and Howard were getting married. This fact repeatedly stabbed my heart, each breath

accompanied by excruciating pain.

My company on the verge of collapse, my marriage over, and Annie-whom I always thought would return to me-about to become someone else's wife.


I took out my phone, found Sarah's number, and sent a brief message:

"About your plan, when can we meet? The sooner the better."

I put the phone in my pocket, my gaze involuntarily falling on the family photo on my desk. already covered with a thin layer of dust-taken during a vacation in Long Island with Annie and Brian. In the photo,Annie smiled. her eyes full of happiness I thought would never fade. Back then. I took her love for granted, as natural as breathing air, not needing to cherish or maintain it.

I closed my eyes, trying to ignore how pathetic I turned out to be now as a strange feeling spread through me-beginning as unbelievable pain,quickly transforming into something darker and more searing.

A thought suddenly flashed through my mind: if I couldn't have Annie,perhaps I didn't want Howard to have her happiness either.

###Chapter 249: You're a Little Late

Annie's POV

I glanced at the clock in the corner of my computer screen-5:45 PM already. Under the office lighting, I couldn't focus on the design draft before me, my thoughts drifting back to that awkward meeting with Philip hours earlier.

Those scattered photos-Howard's college days, a girl I'd never seen before.Philip's confident expression seemed etched into my retina, impossible to shake off.


I remembered his words, spoken with such certainty, as if he'd discovered some earth-shattering secret: "Look at these similarities, Annie, don't you find it strange? You and her, both from single-parent households,both illustrators, both experienced unfair treatment at school..."

My fingertips lightly touched the mouse without clicking anything. These photos, these old stories, shouldn't affect me. But Howard was different,wasn't he? I had allowed myself to fall in love with him...

I could see his focused profile just by looking up, hear his deep voice on the phone, smell that mixture of cedar and amber that always surrounded him. He sat just a few meters away, brow slightly furrowed,his long fingers leaving marks on documents. This image should have reassured me,but today itonly confused me more.
No, I needed to talk to him. We had already decided to get married. If we couldn't be honest about this, our relationship would be built on lies from the start.
"Howard," I heard my voice drift out, hoarser than usual, "could we talk?"


He immediately looked up, his gaze falling warmly on my face. He was always like this-no matter how busy, he could instantly give me his complete attention.

"Of course," he put down his document, "you've seemed distracted all day.What's wrong?"

I took a deep breath, my fingertips unconsciously curling into my palms: "Philip came to see me at lunch."

Howard's expression instantly became alert, his eyes narrowing slightly like a lion sensing danger: "What did he do?"

My heart beat faster, like butterflies fluttering in my chest: "He showed me something...about your college girlfriend." I met his gaze, trying to find fragments of truth in it, "He said she was a lot like me. Single-parent family, liked drawing, bullied at school... he implied I'mjust her...replacement."

I felt my palms growing slightly damp. In that moment, I realized how afraid I was of losing Howard,losing Lucy,losing this family I had finally found.

Howard's expression changed rapidly, from surprise to confusion,before unexpectedly breaking into a light laugh.

"So that's his new trick?" Howard's tone carried obvious mockery, "Using my relationship from twenty years ago to disrupt us?"
Howard stood up and walked around his desk to face me. His movements were unhurried but carried an unprecedented solemnity. He didn't touch me, just stood there, giving me enough space: "Yes, I didI have a profound relationship in college. She was special... intelligent, stubborn, and full of

creativity."

Howard continued, his voice deep and sincere: "But Annie, you're not her replacement. That relationship ended long ago. She's married now-I even attended her wedding. We haven't been in contact since."

"So those similarities are just coincidences?" I heard my voice trembling,my heart like a pebble suspended at a cliff's edge,one gust of wind away from falling into the abyss.

Howard's gaze met mine directly, clear and resolute: "Life is full óf these coincidences. Annie. But I love you, Annie Baker, not because of any similarities you might share with someone else, but because you are you.Uniquely you."

He reached out, his warm palm covering the back of my hand, that warmth beginning to mnelt the ice within me. I could feel my defenses gradually dissolving, the shadows cast by those photos being driven away by Howard's honesty.

"I believe you," I heard myself say softly, my eyes growing warm, "I just...I don't want secrets between us."

"No secrets," Howard's voice was as steady as a promise, "complete honesty from now on."

We smiled at each other, the tension in the air dissipating, replaced by a deep understanding and acceptance. Howard slowly leaned closer,and I could feel his breath brush my cheek, carrying comfort and anticipation.Just as our lips were about to touch-
"Uh, sorry to interrupt!" A lively female voice suddenly intruded as the office door was pushed open forcefully,making a harsh scraping sound.

Catherine Morgan stood in the doorway,wearing a brilliant smile,holding a folder, looking like a gossip bomb about to explode.

"Oh! Sorry, I didn't know you were..." She noticed our intimate posture.a flash of embarrassment crossing her face as she made to retreat, then stopped as if remembering something. "But this news really can't wait!"

Howard reluctantly released my hand, adjusted his tie,his voice betraying undisguised irritation: "Catherine, are you familiar with the concept of knocking?"

"Sorry, boss," Catherine grinned without a hint of remorse, her attention completely turning to me, "but you have to hear this gossip!"

Howard shook his head, returning to his seat: "I'll finish these documents while you two chat."

Catherine pulled me to a corner of the office like a whirlwind,lowering her voice. eyes sparkling with excitement: "Remember Bill White? That guy who kept harassing me?"

I nodded, recalling the man who once pestered Catherine at the restaurant-a completely ordinary-looking man with excessive self-confidence.

"I finally know why he always knew my work schedule!" Catherine's voice carried treasure-discovery excitement, "It was Caroline Gluck who told him!Sarah Johnson's good friend!"
"Caroline?" I raised my eyebrows in surprise, a wave of discomfort rising in my chest. I'd seen Caroline a few times, always following Sarah around,smugly judging everyone's clothes, hair, and background."Why would she do that?"


"Apparently she thinks I don't deserve to work at Howard Technologies,"Catherine smirked, a flash of vengeful satisfaction in her eyes, "so I did something brilliant. I told Bill that Caroline has secretly been in love with him but is too shy to confess."


"Youdidn't!" I gasped, both shocked and irresistibly drawn to Catherine's boldness.


"I absolutely did!" Catherine clapped her hands proudly,like a child who'd completed a prank. "Now Bill bothers Caroline every day, and that fallen rich boy expects Caroline to support him! She not only has to work but also deal with a parasite. It's so satisfying!"

I shook my head, but my lips curved upward involuntarily: "Catherine,you're really..."

"Brilliantly clever?" Catherine winked, "Anyway, I won't distract you anymore. I just couldn't wait to share this with you."

After Catherine left. I realized it was nearly an hour past my usual quitting time. I quickly saved my files, shut down my computer, and tidied my desk. Though Catherine's interruption had delayed my wvork,my doubts about Howard's ex-girlfriend had dissipated, replaced by a sense of relief.

"Sorry to keep you waiting," I stood up and said to Howard, "Catherine's gossip took longer than expected."
Howard closed his folder, his face full of gentle smiles: "No problem. Let's go pick up Lucy now, we're already later than usual."
I nodded, quickly gathered my bag, and left the office with Howard.Walking toward the elevator, I secretly moved closer to him, feeling his warmth. Thinking about how we would soon see Lucy's angelic smile, a

warm current of happiness flowed through my heart. After Philip's attempts to drive us apart, I was more certain than ever that this was the life I wanted-with Howard, with Lucy, a real family.

When Howard's car stopped in front of Upper East SidePrivate Preschool,I sensed something unusual. The school was much quieter than normal;typically at this hour, several children would still be waiting for their parents. My intuition sharply detected that something was wrong, and my heart suddenly accelerated.

"Strange." Howard frowned, his voice revealing a hint of unease,"there should still be a few kids waiting for pickup at this time."

An indescribable fear suddenly gripped my heart, making breathing difficult. I didn't know why I had this premonition, but my body reacted before my mind: "Let's go inside and check."

We hurried to the front desk. When Ms. Wilson saw us, a flash of surprise crossed her face, intensifying my anxiety.

"Mr. Thompson? Ms. Baker? You're a little late. I thought Lucy had already been picked up."

"What?" Howard and I asked in unison. I felt dizzy, as if the ground were tilting beneath my feet.
Ms. Wilson looked at us with confusion: "Nobody picked her up, but she's not in the waiting area. I thought Mr. and Mrs. Parker came for her,since they sometimes do."
My nails dug unconsciously into my palms as I asked apprehensively.

"Is that so?"



###Chapter 250:Where's Lucy?

Annie's POV

"Lucy's alreaddy been picked up?" Ms. Wilson's words hit me like a sledgehammer to the chest. my voice rising sharply with surprise.

An indescribable premonition instantly crawled over my entire body.I desperately tried to suppress the tremor in my voice: "How is that possible?Who took her?"

Ms. Wilson's face was filled with confusion. "I'm not sure. I thought Mr.and Mrs. Parker came for her. When I saw Lucy wasn't in the waiting area,I assumed she'd been picked up by family."

I exchanged a glance with Howard, seeing the same unease flickering in his eyes. "Lucyy wouldn't leave with anyone unauthorized," his voice was low and firm. but I could sense the anxiety hidden beneath his calm exterior. "She knows the rules."

"I need to see the security footage immediately," Howard told Ms. Wilson,his voice carrying an undeniable authority.

We followed Ms. Wilson briskly to the monitoring room, each second of delay making my heart race faster. On the screen, Lucy had indeed gone to the waiting area after school but left the frame without staying long.

"I need to make a call," Howard said,pulling out his phone and activating the speaker. When Edward Parker's voice came through, my heart nearly stopped.

"Edward, did you and Eleanor pick up Lucy today?" Howard asked directly.

"No." Edward's voice reflected obvious confusion. "We had no plans to pick her up today. What's wrong? Has something happened?"

In the background. Eleanor's worried voice came through: "Is everything okay? Is Lucy alright?"


My blood seemed to freeze in my veins, a suffocating fear gripping my throat. Howard responded quickly: "It's probably just a misunderstanding.We'll get back to you soon."

After hanging up, Howard and I exchanged a look, able to read the fear in each other's eyes without words. Lucy, my little angel, where was she? The thought that she might be alone, frightened, or worse,made my heart feel like it was being squeezed by an invisible hand.

"We need to split up and search," Howard's voice broke through my panic."You ask other parents, I'll check the rest of the school."

I nodded, forcing myself to pull it together. Just then, a familiar figure entered-Penny and her mother Sue.

"Annie!" Sue waved, her smile bright, clearly unaware of what was happening. "You're late today."

I rushed over to them, my voice trembling with urgency: "Sue,did Penny see Lucy today?"

Sue's smile froze as she sensed the distress in my voice: "What's wrong? Is Lucy missing?"
Penny tilted her head in thought, her golden curls swaying gently:"I played with Lucy today! After class, she went to the waiting area first,then we played together at the playground for a while."

I immediately crouched down to Penny's eye level,trying not to frighten her: "Then what? How long did you play? When did Lucy leave?" I struggled to keep my voice steady, but each word felt like it was being squeezed from a taut string.

Penny furrowed her small brow, her expression turning serious:"We played on the swings for a bit, then I went to get a snack my mom packed.When I came back. Lucy wasn't there anymore. I thought someone had picked her up."

Howard and I exchanged another glance before he asked1,"Can you show us this playground? Where you were playing?"

Following Penny to the playground, the evening sunlight cast a golden glow over the entire area, the swings gently swaying in the evening breeze.Under different circumstances, it would have been a beautiful scene, but now, the empty playground sent a chill through me.

Fighting back tears, I checked every possible corner-behind the slide,under the climbing frame,among the bushes-but found no trace of Lucy.My heartbeat thundered in my ears, my hands trembling slightly with fear.

"Lucy wouldn't leave on her own," Howard repeated, his expression tense like a string about to snap. "She knows the rules."

Just then, a uniformed man approached us, his eyes reflecting our anxiety."Excuse me,have you seen Brian Baker? I'm Mitchell, Brian's driver.He should have been waiting here for me."
The unease in my heart instantly expanded into undeniable fear. Lucy and Brian, two children, missing simultaneously? This couldn't possibly be coincidence.

"No, we haven't seen Brian," I heard myself answer, my voice barely recognizable.


Mitchell observed our anxious expressions, seemingly realizing he had interrupted something important. "Sorry to bother you," he said quietly,his gaze moving between Howard and me. "I see you're concerned about something too. I'll continue looking elsewhere."

He nodded politely and quickly left, leaving us to continue searching the empty playground. I exchanged a look with Howard, seeing my own fear reflected in his eyes. Just then, my phone suddenly rang,displaying an unknown number.

My finger hesitated for a second before pressing answer. "Hello?"

"Annie Baker." a chillingly familiar voice came from the other end-Sarah Johnson. "You must be worried about Lucy. Don't worry, she's with me.Brian is here too."

Her words felt like ice water poured over my head. My body instantly went numb,with only fear coursing through me like an electric current."Sarah? What are you saying? Give Lucy back to me!" My voice broke with fear and anger.

Howard immediately moved closer to hear the call.

"Don't rush, Annie," Sarah's voice carried a sickening smugness. "If you want to see Lucy again, do exactly as I say. You and Howard need to split up now. You go to the abandoned factory on Fifth Street in Brooklyn, and Howard goes to the old pier in northern Long Island. Remember,don't tell anyone, and don't call the police, or... I can't guarantee what will happen to these children. You have one hour,"

The call suddenly ended, leaving us standing there, too shocked to move.I felt as if my soul had been pulled from my body, leaving only an empty shell filled with fear and despair.

"Who was it? What do they want?" Howard's voice was hoarse and low,his eyes flashing with dangerous light.

My hands trembled so much I could barely hold the phone: "It was Sarah...she said she's kidnapped Lucy and Brian. She wants us to go to different places... if we tell anyone or call the police,she'll hurt the children."

Howard's first instinct was to reach for his phone: "I'm calling security right now-"

"No!" I grabbed his arm, my nails nearly digging into his skin. "She said if we tell anyone,she'll hurtLucy and Brian. We can't risk it!"

I saw the struggle on Howard's face, his expression caught between anger and fear. "This is clearly a trap, Annie. She's separating us for a reason."

"I know," my voice was barely audible, "but we have no choice. It's Lucy...and Brian."

My heart ached at mentioning Brian's name. Despite my marriage to Philip being over, despite Brian having been turned against me by Sarah,he was still the child I had raised in my arms, my son whom I would always love.

Howard gripped my hand tightly, his palm warm and firm."Listen,we'll split up as she says, but I won't let you face danger alone."
He quickly sent a text: "I just notified Susan. I didn't explain the situation,just told her to have necessary support ready. If anything happens, just send your location."

I nodded, forcing myself to breathe deeply, trying to calm the fear churning inside me. "One hour. We need to move quickly."

As we hurried toward the parking lot, the evening breeze brushed my cheeks with early autumn coolness. I looked back at the empty playground.the swings still gently swaying in the wind, as if silently calling for the children who were no longer there.

"Lucy, mommy's coming to save you," I silently promised,while praying this wouldn't be the last time I saw this world, saw Howard, saw the happiness we had just begun to build.

###Chapter 251: Rescue Mission

Howard's POV

"I go to the abandoned factory on Fifth Street in Brooklyn, and you go to the old pier in northern Long Island. Remember, don't tell anyone, don't call the police. or... I can't guarantee what will happen to these children.You have one hour." Sarah's voice was ice-cold through the phone before the call abruptly ended.

I stared at Annie's trembling hands as she held her phone, her eyes moist,lips quivering with fear. We hurriedly left the empty preschool,walking toward the parking lot as the night breeze carried the first chill of early autumn across our faces.

"Annie," I grabbed her hand, gently pulling her toward me, "I promise, I won't let anything happen to Lucy. No matter what, we'll rescue her and Brian."

Despite my words. I wasn't nearly as confident as I appeared. Sarah had clearly lost her mind. and what a desperate woman might do, even I couldn't predict. But right now, Annie needed certainty and support,not my doubts.

"I know it'Il be okay," Annie tried to force a smile that quickly crumbled,"but if Sarah hurts Lucy... or Brian..."
"Listen to me," I gently lifted her chin, making her look directly into my eyes, "We'll split up as she demands. But I won't let you face danger alone.




She nodded, taking a deep breath, and I could see her struggling to control

her emotions. This woman, still so strong after losing everything, made my heart contract with admiration. I silently vowed to protect our newly formed family at any cost.

We parted in the parking lot, Annie driving toward Long Island while I called a taxi. Inside the car. I watched Annie's vehicle heading in the opposite direction. The separation felt like physical pain, knowing she was heading into danger alone. The city lights blurred outside the window as my mind raced through possibilities and plans.

"Where to, sir?" the driver asked, interrupting my thoughts.

"Head north for now." I answered, needing time to think before finalizing my destination.

My fingers hovered over my phone, considering whether to call the police.But Sarah's threat made my blood freeze. Lucy, my niece, who became my daughter after my brother William's yacht accident-I couldn't risk her safety.

But going in without backup was equally dangerous. Sarah had clearly lost her rational judgment, making her unpredictable. I needed more information.

I quickly dialed Robert's number. A month ago, I had instructed him to create a fake "Howard Thompson" account to communicate with Sarah,monitoring her true intentions-a necessary precaution, especially as her attitude toward Annie grew increasingly hostile.
"Robert," I said in a low voice when the call connected, "I need information about Sarah. Has she been acting strange recently?"
"Howard?" Robert sounded confused. "I was about to contact you.

Something happened yesterday..."

"What?" I asked quickly, sensing the situation might be more complex than I imagined.

Robert paused, his voice heavy with guilt. "Yesterday I... I told Sarah about the fake account. I thought she should know we were monitoring her."


"You did what?" My voice was almost a roar. "Why didn't you consult me first?"


"I was going to tell you, but..." his voice carried clear defensiveness.

"She's kidnapped Lucy and Brian," I interrupted, anger washing over my rationality. "Why didn't you tell me about her reaction immediately?"

"My God..." I could hear him inhale sharply. "I thought she would just be angry with me. I never imagined she would... I'm sorry, Howard. I truly didn't anticipate..."

My hand tightened into a fist, knuckles turning white. Anger at Robert's unauthorized action boiled within me, but what's done was done. The current crisis was more important. I forced myself to calm down,needing clear thinking rather than pointless accusations.

"What's happened has happened. Now we must solve the problem. Send me the chat logs--I need to understand her recent state of mind."

"Sending them now," he responded immediately, voice filled with remorse.

Minutes later, the chat logs Robert sent ignited my fury. Sarah had been trying to seduce me while manipulating both Philip and Robert. Her messages revealed a calculated plan to replace Annie in my life, stopping

at nothing.

Even more disturbing were today's messages-after Philip's public scandal destroyed her career, her anger was directed entirely at Annie, apparently convinced Annie had orchestrated everything. Her final messages showed clear instability.filled with vengeful rhetoric.

Through these increasingly unhinged messages, I detected a pattern: Sarah wasn't targeting me-her target was Annie. She wanted to eliminate Annie so she could take her place. The children were just her leverage, bait to lure us in.


I faced an agonizing choice. Following Sarah's demands, I should go to the Long Island pier while Annie went to the abandoned factory in Brooklyn.But the situation had clearly escalated beyonad our initial expectations.Who could guarantee Sarah only wanted to meet us? If we followed her arrangement, separating to different locations, wouldn't we be playing right into her hands?

I closed my eyes, trying to clear my thoughts. Through these chat logs,Sarah's objective became crystal clear: she wasn't targeting me-her target was Annie. Lucy and Brian were merely pawns in her scheme.

If I went to the Long Island pier, Annie might face real danger in Brooklyn. But if I didn't follow Sarah's demands and went to find Annie instead. this might enrage Sarah, causing her to harm Lucy. Cold sweat beaded on my forehead; the weight of this decision was suffocating.
Analyzing Sarah's behavior pattern once more, I realized she needed Lucy and Brian as leverage to control us. If she truly harmed Lucy,she would lose that control. Lucy was more valuable to her alive as a hostage than as a victim. From this perspective, finding Annie and protecting her from harm seemed the more logical choice.

Decision made. I called Robert again, this time with clear instructions.

"Robert. I need you to go to the old pier in northern Long Island. Sarah is expecting me there, but I'm going to the abandoned factory in Brooklyn to find Annie."


"Are you sure?" Robert sounded concerned. "Isn't that violating her demands?"


"Sarah wants Annie, not me," I explained, my voice low with tension. "I must protect Annie. I need you to appear at the pier in my place. Don't approach Sarah directly, keep your distance, observe, and be ready to help if needed."


"Understood. I'm leaving now," Robert promised, guilt and determination clear in his voice. "Should I notify the police?"

"No, not yet. Sarah explicitly warned us not to contact anyone. Wait for my further instructions."

After hanging up. I told the taxi driver, "Take me to the abandoned factory on Fifth Street in Brooklyn."

As we drove toward Brooklyn. I silently prayed my judgment was correct.If I was wrong, the consequences would be unbearable. Annie's and Lucy's faces alternated in my mind-I had to protect them, my new family,the two most important people in my life.
"Hold on," I whispered to myself, "I'm coming for you both."

###Chapter 252: The Trap

Annie's POV

Sarah's cold threat echoed in my mind as I drove through the darkening streets of New York toward Brooklyn: "You and Howard need to split up now. You go to the abandoned factory on Fifth Street in Brooklyn, and Howard goes to the old pier in northern Long Island. Remember, don't tell anyone, and don't call the police. or... I can't guarantee what will happen to these children."


My hands gripped the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles turned white.Outside the window, city lights blurred as tears threatened to cloud my vision. I blinked them away, forcing myself to focus on the road. I couldn't afford to break down now-Lucy and Brian needed me.

The image of the empty playground from hours earlier haunted me-Lucy's favorite swing still gently swaying in the evening breeze, void of children's laughter. If only I hadn't stayedlate at the office. If only I'd picked Lucy up on time. Self-recrimination gnawed at me with each mile I drove.

A red light forced me to stop, my fingers anxiously tapping against the steering wheel. I glanced at my watch-time was slipping away, bringing Sarah's deadline ever closer. Howard was right-this was almost certainly a trap. But when I closed my eyes, all I could see was Lucy curledI in my arms,her tiny body trembling from nightmares, gradually calming under my touch.

"Lucy's safety comes first," I whispered to myself, determination hardening my resolve. "I can't let her get hurt again."
My mind drifted to our recent conversation about marriage. Lucy's innocent worry about being forgotten if Howard and I hadour own child.

The irony stung-I might never even get the chance to prove to her how wrong she was. I thought of Howard too, imagining him driving to the pier, perhaps facing similar danger. Our family, so recently formed, now threatened from all sides.


The light turned green, and I pressed forward, street by street getting closer to Brooklyn's industrial distriet. "Lucy, mommy's coming to save you,"I promised silently. "Brian, even if you hate me. I won't abandon you."


When I finally reached Fifth Street, the abandoned factory loomed before me like something from a nightmare-a hulking silhouette against the twilight sky. I parked carefully and stepped out, the cool evening air raising goosebumps on my skin. Broken windows gaped like dark, vacant eyes across the factory's facade. Several rust-streaked buildings stood in eerie silence, with only distant car horns reminding me that civilization still existed beyond this desolate place.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the cracked concrete, creating an eerie tableau that sent chills down my spine. I'd driven through this industrial area before but had never noticed this particular complex-how long had it been abandoned? Decades, judging by the deterioration. A perfect place for Sarah's scheme, whatever it might be.

My hand lingered over my phone. Should I text Howard? But Sarah's threat immediately resurfaced in my mind. I couldn't risk the children's safety.Sliding the phone back into my pocket, I gathered my courage and approached the decrepit structure, my heart pounding against my ribs.
The main entrance stood partially open, rusted hinges creaking in the gentle breeze. I pushed the door wider, wincing at the metal's protest. The air inside was thick with moisture and decay,mingled with the acrid scent

of rusted metal. A small animal-a rat, probably-scurried across my path and disappeared into the darkness.

"Lucy? Brian?" I called softly, my voice echoing through the cavernous space.

Silence answered me.

Only my footsteps on the concrete floor broke the stillness as I ventured deeper. Unease twisted my stomach into knots. I pulled out my phone,activating the flashlight to illuminate my path through the darkness. The beam caught dust particles dancing in the air, a surreal sight that only heightened my sense of dread.

As I moved further into the factory, my light revealed dust-covered floors and scattered debris. With each step, my pulse quickened. Abandoned machinery and empty cardboard boxes created bizarre shadows on the walls,shapes that seemed to shift when I wasn't looking directly at them.Water dripped somewhere in the distance, each drop echoing like a clock counting down.

I passed through what must have been a production area,my flashlight revealing conveyor belts frozen in time, covered in decades of grime. Old desks were overturned, filing cabinets emptied, their contents long since looted or destroyed. I tried to imagine what this place had once been-full of workers,humming with activity-but now it felt like a tomb.
Suddenly,a faint voice reached my ears: "Help... Mommy... save me..."

My heart nearly stopped. "Lucy!" I rushed toward the sound, pushing open a half-closed door at the corridor's end, nearly stumbling in my haste.
Inside was a sparse room containing only a bed, a video camera on a


tripod, and a table with a tape recorder-the source of Lucy's pleading voice. The terrible realization washed over me like ice water. This was a trap. The recording continued playing. Lucy's frightened voice a cruel mockery of my hopes.


Just as the thought formed, footsteps sounded behind me. I whirled around to see Philip standing in the doorway, his expression unnervingly blank.


"Philip?" I gasped, disbelief and fear colliding in my chest. "What are you doing here? Where are Lucy and Brian?"

He stepped into the room, deliberately closing the door behind him. "I'm sorry, Annie," he said with disturbing calmness, "but this is the only way."

"What way? Philip, tell me where the children are!" My voice rose with panic and anger. "Did you work with Sarah on this? How could you?"

His eyes,once warm and familiar, now looked foreign in the dim light. "Sarah?" He laughed softly, the sound devoid of humor. "Sarah was just a tool, a convenient distraction. This was always between you, me,and Howard."

"If I can't have you," he said quietly, his eyes darkening, "then Howard can't either."
Before I could react, Philip lunged forward, pressing a cloth over my nose and mouth. I instinctively held my breath, struggling against his grip.My nails clawed at his arms, but his strength overwhelmed mine. I fought desperately, kicking and twisting, but couldn't break free. My mind flashed to Lucy and Brian-were they really in danger, or had that been another lie?

"Don't fight it. Annie." Philip whispered in my ear, his voice sickly gentle,"it will be over soon."

I continued holding my breath, my mind racing for any possible escape.The drug began seeping through my skin, making the room spin. My limbs grew heavy, but consciousness stubbornly clung on, refusing to surrender completely to darkness.

Feeling my resistance weaken. Philip loosened his hold, assuming the drug had taken full effect. He pulled out rope, beginning to bind my wrists and ankles. Though my body felt leaden and unresponsive, my mind remained hazily aware. I could feel the rope tightening around my wrists but lacked the strength to resist.

Through the fog descending over my thoughts, one terrifying clarity emerged-this wasn't just a trap; it was a meticulously planned revenge.Philip, the man I had once loved, had become a stranger capable of unimaginable cruelty. Fear and despair washed over me as darkness began to claim the edges of my vision.

###Chapter 253: I Had to Survive This night

Annie's POV

Philip loosened his grip, convinced I'd succumbed to the drug. My limbs felt impossibly heavy, but my consciousness stubbornly fought the chemical fog. I could feel him binding my wrists and ankles with coarse rope that bit into my skin, sending sharp jolts of pain through my dulled senses.


He carefully lifted me onto the decrepit bed in the corner of the room. The mattress groaned beneath my weight. I struggled to stay alert as darkness crept in from the edges of my vision. Philip's fingers brushed across my cheek. a once-familiar touch that now sent shivers of revulsion through me.

"You could have come back to me, Annie," Philip whispered, his voice carrying a disturbing tenderness. "We could have started over. You, me,and Brian-a complete family again."

My thoughts drifted away, memories flooding in like a tide. I remembered my first meeting with Howard, the sweet moment when Lucy first called me "Mommy," those ordinary yet precious days that might now be consumed by this nightmare.

"No one is coming to save you, Annie," Philip continued, the confidence in his voice chilling me to the bone. "Howard is waiting at the pier in Long Island for Sarah who will never show up, while you're here, completely mine."

In desperation, I bit through my lower lip. The sharp pain cut through the drug-induced haze likelightning. The taste of blood spread through my mouth as my awareness gradually sharpened. I needed to buy time,to protect myself-for Howard and Lucy, for my family.

"She's awake? Impossible!" Philip muttered in surprise. I could feel his breathing quicken.

I opened my eyes, blinking several times to focus. Philip stood beside the bed, the drugged cloth in his hand, ready to use it again. My brain was still foggy. but my survival instinct had fully awakened.

"Philip, stop," my voice was weak but determined. "Do you realize what you're doing? This is kidnapping. This is a crime."

He paused, looking down at me. In the dim light, his eyes gleamed with a madness I'd never seen before.

"A crime?" he repeated sarcastically. "When Howard stole you from me,wasn't that a crime? When you betrayed our marriage, wasn't that a crime?
,

"We were already over, Philip," I struggled to stay calm. "I never betrayed you. You betrayed me first,with Sarah."

Philip suddenly moved closer, his face inches from mine. "No! You left first! You abandoned our family, abandoned Brian!"
"I never abandoned Brian," I argued, my voice trembling with emotion."You and Sarah took him from me. You made him hate me."

Philip steppedI back, his lips twisting into an eerie smile. "Because he needed to know the truth. He needed to know his mother is a cold-hearted woman who only cares about her own happiness."
I shook my head, though the motion made me dizzy. "Where's Lucy?Where's Brian? What have you done with them?"
"Don't worry, they're safe," Philip answered, his voice suddenly calm."

Safer than they would be with you."

"Philip, what do you want?" I asked, trying to understand the logic behind this madness. "Do you really think this will make me come back to you?"

Philip was silent for a moment before turning toward the camera on the tripod across the room. He adjusted the angle, ensuring it captured me on the bed.


"This isn't about getting you back anymore, Annie," he finally spoke,his voice low and dangerous. "This is about punishment. Punishing you and Howard. If I can't have you, then neither can he."

I felt a chill run down my spine. "What are you going to do?"

"Make Howard feel my pain," Philip said with a cold smile. "Let him know what it's like to lose someone he loves."

My mind raced, searching for any way to delay or change Philip's plan. I needed to find his weakness, to disrupt his intentions.

"So this was Sarah's idea?" I asked, trying to divert his attention. "She told you to do this?"

Philip laughed, a hollow, desolate sound. "Sarah? She wvas just a tool. A convenient distraction. This was all my plan."

I took a deep breath, decidling to take a risk. "Philip, have you considered why Sarah wanted you to do this? Why she's so eager to destroy my relationship with Howard?"
Philip frowned. "That doesn't matter."

"Of course it matters," I persisted. "The baby, Philip. Haveyou considered

that it might not be yours?"

Philip's expression froze, and I knew I'd touched on his doubts.

"Nonsense," he whispered, but uncertainty betrayed him. "Of course it's my child."

"Is it?" I pressed. "Sarah's been with so many men. Are you sure it's yours?Why would you commit crimes for her? Why follow her instructions?"

Philip's face paled, and I could see a flicker of hesitation in his eyes. I'd found my opening.

"That's ridiculous." he said, but his voice lacked conviction. He paced back and forth, fingers raking through his hair. "Sarah wouldn't... she couldn't..."


"Think about it, Philip," I continued, focusing all my energy on sounding reasonable despite the ropes cutting into my wrists. "Why is she so invested in destroying my life? It's not about you-it's about Howard. It's always been about Howard."

Philip stopped pacing, his expression shifting between doubt and anger.I could practically see the gears turning in his mind as he processed this new perspective.
"She wanted Howard from the beginning," I pressed on. "You were just...convenient. A way to stay close to the situation."
"No." Philip muttered, but the seed of doubt had clearly taken root. "No,that's not possible."
I twisted my wrists against the ropes, trying to create even the slightest bit of slack while keeping my face neutral. The drug was wearing off, but I

needed to appear weaker than I was.

"Where are the children really. Philip?" I asked softly. "Are they even with Sarah? Or did she lie about that too?"


His expression flickered with uncertainty. "They're... they're safe."

"Did you actually see them? Or did Sarah just tell you she had them?"

"She's using you. Philip, just like she always has," I said, my voice gentle but firm. "Just like she did with making Brian hate me. Just like she did with the pregnancy. Ask yourself-who benefits most from all this?"

I watched his face contort with conflicting emotions-anger, confusion,betrayal. The camera stood forgotten in the corner as Philip withdrew his phone with trembling hands.

"I need to make a call." he said, eyes darting nervously around the room.

This was my chance. As Philip turned away to dial, I redoubled my efforts to loosen the ropes, ignoring the burning sensation as they chafed against my skin. I had to get free. I had to find Lucy and Brian. But most importantly. I had to survive this night.

###Chapter 254: He Broke the Rules

Robert's POV

Night had completely enveloped the old pier in northern Long Island. The distant lighthouse beam swept across the desolate area every few seconds,briefly illuminating the decaying wooden planks and rusted metal structures. The sea breeze howled through abandoned warehouses,carrying the salty dampness and subtle scent of decay.

The temperature had dropped considerably since sunset, and I pulled my jacket tighter around my shoulders, feeling a chill that had nothing to do with the weather.

My hands trembled slightly against the steering wheel, Howard Thompson's urgent call still echoing in my mind: "Robert, I need you to go to the old pier in northern Long Island. Sarah is expecting me there,but I'm going to the abandoned factory in Brooklyn to find Annie."

The guilt that had been gnawing at me since I'd revealed the fake account to Sarah intensified. I should have told Howard immediately about her reaction-that dangerous flash in her eyes, the unnerving calmness in her voice when she realized she'd been monitored. If I had, perhaps none of this would be happening now.

As I parked at the pier entrance, I drew a deep breath, trying to steady my racing heart. The dashboard clock read 7:30 PM. My eyes scanned this nearly forgotten place, once buzzing with fishermen and cargo ships,now abandoned except for the occasional smuggler or teenagers looking for a secluded spot. At the pier's end stood a small lighthouse keeper's cabin, its light flickering occasionally-clearly the only structure still in use.
"This must be where Sarah chose to meet," I whispered to myself, images

of golden-haired Lucy flashing through my mind. The thought of innocent children involved in adult vendettas made my stomach turn.

I grabbed the flashlight from my glove compartment and stepped out. The wind immediately whipped through my hair, carrying the distant sound of foghorns from ships navigating the treacherous waters. I carefully made my way along the wooden walkway toward the pier's end.

With each step forward, the creaking boards seemed to warn of the danger ahead,some planks shifting unnervingly beneath my weight. In the distance. Atlantic waves crashed against the pier, their rhythm mixing with my rapid breathing.

My thoughts drifted to Sarah-how had she gone from the charismatic,ambitious woman I'd married to this? Our relationship had always been tumultuous,marked by passionate reconciliations and equally passionate fights. But kidnapping? This was beyond anything I could have imagined,even from her.

By 7:45 PM, I stood before the lighathouse keeper's cabin, its weathered exterior speaking of decades battling coastal storms. I hesitated briefly before gently pushing open the unlocked door. The hinges protested with a long,eerie creak. Inside, dim lighting revealed a hallway leading to several rooms. the walls covered with peeling maritime-themed wallpaper and old fishing nets.
"Is anyone here?" I called tentatively, my voice echoing through the empty corridor. The floorboards groaned beneath my weight as I took a few cautious steps forward.
No response came, but I was certain I'd heard faint sounds from the innermost room-a muffled whimper, perhaps, or the shuffle of small feet.Taking another deep breath, I slowly moved toward the source, my

heartbeat thundering in my ears.

The smell of mildew and something else-something sweeter, like the perfume Sarah always wore-grew stronger as I approached the final door.I steeled myself for what I might find, hoping desperately that Howard's fears were unfounded, that Sarah wasn't capable of involving children in her vendetta.


When I pushed open the final door, the sight before me made me gasp.Lucy and Brian were tied to chairs, blindfolded with strips of cloth, their mouths sealed with duct tape. Small, frightened whimpers escaped from behind Lucy's gag. My son Max stood nearby, holding a flashlight clearly too large for himn. watching the doorway warily. The room was sparsely furnished-just the chairs, an old table, and some fishing equipment against the walls.

"Dad!"Max exclaimed with surprise when he saw me, immediately starting toward me. His chubby face lit up with momentary relief, clearly not understanding the gravity of the situation.

In that moment. I felt something hard press against my back-unmistakably the barrel of a gun-and froze mid-step.

"Don't move," Sarah's voice came from behind me, cold and dangerous,entirely different from the warm tones she used with our son. "Max, step back."

Max halted, his expression changing from joy to confusion. His eyes darted between Sarah and me, trying to comprehend what was happening."Mom,what's going on?"
"Nothing, sweetheart," Sarah's voice suddenly softened, transitioning seamlessly from threatening to motherly. "This is just a game adults play.

Go sit down over there like a good boy."

I turned slowly, careful not to make any sudden movements,to find Sarah holding a small pistol, its barrel pointed directly at me. When she saw my face,her expression shifted from threatening to disappointed, her perfectly applied makeup unable to hide the momentary confusion in her eyes.

"Robert?" she asked incredulously, lowering the gun slightly before raising it again. "Where's Howard?"

"Sarah,have you lost your mind?" I whispered, keeping my voice lowN So the children wouldn't hear, though my tone couldn't disguise my shock."You kidnapped three children? Our son?"

Sarah's laugh carried a hint of hysteria, echoing unnervingly in the small room. "I just wanted to teach Annie a lesson. She ruined everything for me!My career. my reputation, even you're on her side now!" Her finger trembled slightly on the trigger. "After everything I built, she destroyed it all!"


My gaze swept across the three children in the room. Golden-haired Lucy and brown-haired Brian trembled with fear, small shoulders shaking beneath their school uniforms, while Max watched everything with growing unease, his earlier confusion giving way to fear.

"Sarah, the children are here," I tried to keep my voice calm despite the anxiety evident on my somewhat haggard face. "We shouldn't discuss this in front of them. Let's step outside, alright? We can talk this through, find a solution."

Sarah glanced at Max, whose eyes were now filling with tears.Her expression momentarily softened, maternal instinct briefly overriding her rage.

"Fine," she nodded after a moment's hesitation. "But don't try anything stupid."


She motioned for me to walk ahead, keeping the gun trained on my back as we moved into the living room of the small cabin.

In the cramped space, a dim yellow bulb provided weak illumination,casting long shadows across the worn furniture. Sarah closed the door to the children's room but kept her gun pointed at me, her perfectly manicured nails contrasting starkly with the deadly weapon in her hand.

"Where is Howard?" she demanded again, her tone threatening.

"I don't know," I admitted honestly, struggling to control my naturally irritable temperament. "He asked me to come here. He didn't tell me where he was going." The lie came easily, but I avoided direct eye contact,focusing instead on the gun.

Sarah narrowed her eyes, considering this for a few seconds. Suddenly,her expression changed with realization, eyes widening as pieces fell into place."He went to find Annie, didn't he? He went to Brooklyn!"

I didn't answer, but my silence confirmed her guess.

"He broke the rules!" Sarah shouted angrily, running her fingers through her carefully styled hair. "I was very clear-Howard comes to the pier,Annie goes to the factory! They're not supposed to contact anyone!" Her voice rose with each word,the careful facade of control crumbling.
"Sarah, put the gun down," I attempted to calm her, my hands raised in a placating gesture. "Think about Max, think about the baby in your belly.Do you really want to continue down this path? Is revenge worth destroying everyone's lives-including your own?"

For a brief moment, uncertainty flickered across her face. Then Sarah's eyes glinted dangerously as her mouth curved into a calculating smile I knew all too well from our marriage-the expression she wore when cornered but still holding an ace. "It's too late, Robert. Everything's too late now."


She pulled out her phone and quickly dialed a number, keeping the gun trained on me with her other hand.

"Philip?" Her voice was tense and hurried. "Howard isn't coming. He went to find Annie. Proceed with the plan immediately!"

###Chapter 255: Your Parents Are Fighting

Lucy's POV

This room is cold and smells like seawater. I'm tied to a hard chair,the ropes hurting my wrists and ankles. There's a blindfold over my eyes and tape on my mouth making it hard to breathe. I can hear Brian quietly crying next to me, moving around like he's trying to break free.

I try not to cry. Daddy always says I need to be brave. But I'm so scared,like the cold seawater seeping through the cracks in the walls.

Just hours ago, it was supposed to be a normal school pickup. After playing on the swings with Penny, I was heading back to the waiting area when Sarah Johnson appeared. I recognized her-Max's mom whom I'd seen at school a few times, though we'd never spoken. Today she wore bright clothes and smelled too strongly of perfume.

"Lucy, darling," Sarah smiled at me, "your uncle Howard sent me to pick you up. Annie had an emergency and couldn't make it."

I became alert immediately. Daddy had told me never to go with strangers,even adults I knew, unless he told me beforehand. I shook my head and stepped back.

"Don't be like that, dear," Sarah's voice became less friendly, "your mom had a little accident, and Howard is at the hospital. He asked me to bring you to them."
This scared me, but I still shook my head, not wanting to go with her.Sarah suddenly grabbed my wrist, hurting me.
"Brian is waiting in the car," Sarah whispered, "he wants to see you.Says

he has something for you."

I hesitated. Once. Brian had helped me. So I trusted him a little.

Sarah pulled me toward the parking lot. I wanted to scream, but there were no teachers I knew around. In the parking lot, I saw Brian sitting in the back seat. looking confused and frightened too. His eyes were wide,as if he'd also been tricked.


Sarah gave us candy, told us to sit quietly, then drove away from school.When Brian asked where she was taking us, she just smiled coldly. Then I remember her driving us to this place by the sea, tying us up, and bringing us to this cabin that smells like saltwater.

I regret following Sarah, thinking of Mommy Annie's warm smile this morning when she kissed my forehead and promised to pick me up on time. I was excited to show Annie my new drawing-of Daddy, Mommy,and me standing in front of our house. That picture is still in my backpack,which Sarah threw in the corner of the room.

I hear footsteps approaching and freeze. The door creaks open, and I hear another child's breathing-Max, Sarah's son. I've seen him at school a few times, a chubby boy who often bullies others. Now he's carrying what sounds like a heavy flashlight, walking around us.

"Mom says I have to watch you," Max says proudly, "she says you two are bad kids."

"Mmph!" Brian tries to speak through the tape, shaking his head hard.

I stay still, listening carefully. I can hear waves hitting the pier outside and foghorns in the distance. The lighthouse beam occasionally shines through the small window, and I can sense its flashing light even through my

blindfold.

The front door creaks, and I hear heavy footsteps. My heart races-is it Daddy coming to rescue me?

"Is anyone here?" a man I don't recognize calls out, his voice deep and gruff.

I try to make noise behind the tape. The footsteps get closer until finally,our room door opens.

"Dad!" Max exclaims happily.

My hope vanishes instantly. If this man is Max's dad, is he a bad person too?

"Don't move," Sarah's voice suddenly comes from behind the man. She sounds scary,nothing like when she talks sweetly to Max. "Max, step back."


Max sounds confused: "Mom, what's going on?"

"Nothing, sweetie," Sarah's voice immediately softens, "this is just a game adults play. Go sit over there like a good boy."
Through my blindfold, I can't see what's happening, but I feel the tension in the room. The man-Robert, I learn later-whispers something in shock,too quiet for me to hear clearly.
I guess this man is Max's dad, but he seems surprised by what Sarah has done. Maybe he's not bad? Maybe he can help us?
I hear them leave the room and close the door. Through the door, I can only make out muffled arguments but can't understand what they're

saying.

After the adults leave. I feel Brian struggling harder. Max walks around us,his flashlight beam dancing on the walls.


"My mom says your mom stole your dad from her," Max tells me,speaking like he's reciting something but also confused, "she says your mom is a bad person."

I shake my head hard. How can I tell him Annie is a good person who reads me stories every night and helped me not be afraid to speak? Annie never makes me feel unloved. I want to say something to Max, but I'm too scared to speak, my throat feeling blocked. I look toward Brian,hoping he can explain.


Brian manages to pull the tape from his mouth a little. "Max," he gasps,his voice raspy, "this is wrong. You know this is wrong. We're just kids-we didn't do anything wrong."

"Shut up!" Max threatens, waving the flashlight, "Mom said to watch you,not talk to you."

"Your parents are fighting," Brian continues, his voice getting louder,"but that's not our fault. Lucy is only five. Do you think it's right to tie her up?"
Max's footsteps pause. "Mom says it's just temporary. Until she fixes things.



I feel tears streaming down under my blindfold. I miss Mommy Annie and Daddy Howard so much. I just want to go home.
Suddenly there's a loud crash outside, followed by hurried footsteps and louder arguing. Max is startled, stepping back with wide eyes.

"Max, don't be scared," Brian says softly, "listen to me. Your parents fighting has nothing to do with us. That's grown-up stuff. But we're innocent. We're just children."

"Brian's right." I suddenly speak, my voice barely audible, "we didn't do anything wrong. Please help us."

Max paces, seeming to consider a difficult question. "But Mom will be angry. She told me I had to watch you."

"Max," Brian says patiently, "think about it. Do you really think tying us up is right? Would you be scared if someone tied you up?"

Max stops, biting his lip. After thinking for a long time,he finally whispers:"Okay."

He carefully approaches me and starts untying the ropes around my wrists."Don't tell my mom I let you go," he pleads.

When I'm free, I immediately remove my blindfold and rub my sore wrists.I quickly help Brian untie his ropes.

"What do we do now?" Max asks nervously, constantly looking at the door.Outside, it's quiet now, which is even more frightening.

"We need to see what's happening out there," Brian whispers, "maybe your dad can help us."

The three of us tiptoe toward the door. Brian leads, I follow behind him.and Max hesitantly comes last.
"Be careful," I warn quietly, my small hand clutching Brian's sleeve tightly.

Just as Brian reaches out to turn the doorknob, a deafening sound breaks
the silence:

BANG!

I clutch Brian's arm tightly, and Max gasps in terror. The three of us freeze in the darkness,too frightened to move.

###Chapter 256: No Turning Back

Robert's POV

The line went dead as Sarah ended her call with Philip. Her eyes, once warm with affection wwhen looking at me, now held nothing but cold determination as she kept the gun pointed at my chest. The yellow bulb overhead cast disturbing shadows across her face, making her appear almost ghoulish in the dimly lit keeper's cabin.

Outside.Atlantic waves crashed against the pier's wooden supports.Each impact sent subtle vibrations through the floor beneath my feet. Inside, the air was thick with tension and the faint scent of Sarah's perfume-the same scent that once intoxicated me now made my stomach turn.

"Why, Sarah?" I asked, struggling to keep my voice steady.My temper had always been my downfall, but I needed to remain calm for the children's sake. "Why go after Annie like this? What did she ever do to you?"

Sarah let out a sharp, humorless laugh that sent chills down my spine.The gun in her hand trembled slightly, and I couldn't tell if it was from emotion or indecision.

"Why?" she repeated, her voice dripping with venom. "You're actually asking me why? Annie Baker is the source of everything that's gone wrong!Look at her-some nobody from Boston who couldn't accept her place in life. She had to seduce Philip, and now she's crawled into Howard's bed!"
My jaw clenched involuntarily. I'd never been good at hiding my emotions,but I needed to try-for Max, for the other children.
"This has nothing to do with Lucy or Brian," I said carefully, keeping my eyes on Sarah's trigger finger. "They're innocent children."

"Innocent?" Sarah stepped closer, the gun now inches from my chest.I could feel my heart hammering against my ribs. "What about me? Wasn't I innocent? Everything Annie does is designed to ruin me. I worked so hard to get close to Philip. Do you know why? For Max! To give our son a better future!"


The mention of our son sent a pang through my heart. Max was in the next room, probably terrified, listening to his mother speak like a madwoman. It was a side of Sarah I'd seen glimpses of during our marriage, but never this extreme, never this dangerous.

"And now," Sarah continued, her voice rising with each word, "even you,Robert, are taking Annie's side. Why? Why does everyone revolve around Annie Baker?"

I could see the unhinged light in her eyes growing brighter.The Sarah I'd married-ambitious,calculating, but rational-was slipping away,replaced by someone I barely recognized. I needed to reach her, to pull her back from this edge.

"Sarah, please," I kept my voice as gentle as possible, though my instinct was to shout. "If you're angry, take it out on me. Leave the chidren out of this."

"It's too late for that." Her smile twisted into something unrecognizable."There's no going back now, Robert."

She suddenly extended her hand toward me. "Give me your phone."

I hesitated, weighing my options. Each second felt stretched to eternity as I calculated outcomes. If I refused, would she shoot? If I complied, what would she do next?

"Now!" Sarah's voice cracked like a whip.

Reluctantly, I handed over my phone. Sarah took it with her free hand,her eyes never leaving mine as she dialed a number one-handed, the gun still aimed at my chest.


"You sound out of breath," she said into the phone, her voice suddenly eerily calm, almost pleased. "Haven't found Annie yet?"

I couldn't hear the response, but from her words and the smug expression that spread across her face. I guessed she was speaking to Howard. My stomach clenched with dread.

"Now you're asking about the children? I'm afraid it's too late for Annie,"Sarah continued, her lips curling into a smile that made my blood run cold.

The person on the other end spoke again, their voice an indistinct rumble from where I stood.

"Don't threaten me," Sarah snapped, her composure fracturing momentarily. "I didn't call to give you information. I'm just curious why you didn't follow my instructions to go to the old pier in Long Island?"

More words from the other end, then Sarah's voice turned sharp.

"I told you, they're with me! Both children are with me! Did you think you could break my rules and get away with it?"

As Sarah became more engrossed in the conversation, I noticed her grip on the gun loosening slightly. Her attention was divided-this might be my only chance.
Memories of our marriage flashed through my mind-the good times before bitterness and resentment took over, the birth of Max, Sarah's smile

when she told me she was pregnant again. The child currently growing in her womb was part of me too, despite everything.

But I looked toward the room where the children were held and made my decision. Their safety came first.

I lunged forward, grabbing for both the phone and the gun simultaneously.Sarah's reflexes were faster than I anticipated. She jerked backward, her finger tightening on the trigger.

"Let go!" she screamed,her face contorted with rage.

We struggled, locked in a desperate grapple. My hands closed around her wrist, trying to point the gun away from both of us. Sarah fought with surprising strength, her nails raking across my cheek, drawing blood. We crashed into a small table, sending an old lamp crashing to the floor.

The gun discharged with a deafening crack that seemed to shake the entire cabin.

Time froze.

Sarah's resistance ceased instantly. Her eyes widened in shock and pain as she looked down at her abdomen. A dark stain was spreading across her cream-colored dress, the fabric quickly becoming saturated with blood.
"No..." she whispered,her legs buckling.

I caught her before she hit the ground, lowering her gently against the wall.The gun slipped from her fingers, and I kicked it away, my heart pounding so hard I could barely breathe.
"Sarah... I knelt beside her, pressing my hands over the wound, trying to stem the bleeding. But the blood continued to seep between my fingers,

hot and sticky. My mind went blank with panic for a moment before years of watching medical dramas kicked in.

Pressure on the wound. Keep her conscious. Call for help.

Sarah's face had already lost its color, her skin taking on an ashen quality that terrified me. But a strange. almost peaceful smile played at the corners of her mouth.


"Look what you've done, Robert," she whispered, her voice so faint I had to lean closer to hear. "You've killed our baby..."

The words struck me unawares. Our baby. My child. Despite everything Sarah had done, despite how our relationship had deteriorated,this was our child. A life we'd created together that would never have a chance to begin.

"I'll call an ambulance," I said, my voice breaking as I reached for the phone that had fallen to the floor during our struggle.

"Too late..." Sarah murmured, her eyes growing unfocused. "Maybe... it's better this way... for the baby..."

As I dialed 911 with shaking fingers, the full weight of what had just happened crashed over me. The irony wasn't lost on me-I'd tried to save three children and ended up taking the life of my own unborn child. Part of me wondered if Sarah was right. What kind oflife would that child have had, born to a mother consumed by hatred and revenge?
"Emergency services, what's your emergency?" a calm voice answered.

"Gunshot wound," I managed to say, my voice sounding distant to my own ears. "Pregnant woman. Lighthouse keeper's cabin, northern Long Island pier. Please hurry."

After giving them the details. I dropped the phone and rushed to the room where the children were held. No matter what had happened,those innocent kids didn't deserve any of this. I had to get them out, had to make sure they were safe.


As I pushed open the door, three small faces turned toward me-Max,Lucy,and Brian. Their eyes wide with fear, their small bodlies trembling.In that moment, seeing their innocence against the backdrop of adult madness, I made a silent vow: I would protect them, all of them, no matter what came next.


There was no turning back now.

###Chapter 257: Too Late

Howard's POV

Sitting in the taxi, I unconsciously clenched and unclenched my fists,palms already damp with sweat. The cab moved through New York's busy nighttime streets, neon signs and streetlights casting shifting patterns through the windows. The atmosphere inside was tense; even the driver seemed to sense my anxiety, occasionally glancing at me through the rearview mirror-a rare sight for someone who prided himself on maintaining composure in any situation.

When the vehicle suddenly ground to a compete halt two blocks from our destination, my patience reached its limit. The road ahead was completely blocked, cars lined up bumper to bumper, horns blaring in frustration.

"What's happening?" I asked, my voice low as I stared at the flashing warning lights ahead.

The driver shook his head, turning on the radio to find traffic updates."Looks like an accident up ahead. Police are working on it."

"How long until we can get through?" My voice carried an unusual urgency.

"Hard to say, sir," he shrugged. "These situations usually take at least thirty to forty-five minutes."

I quickly calculated the time-Sarah's ultimatum gave us one hour, and twenty minutes had already passed. Every second was precious; I couldn't afford to wait.

"How far is the abandoned factory on Fifth Street from here?" I asked,

already unbuckling my seatbelt.

"About fifteen minutes on foot," the driver replied.

I quickly pulled out my wallet, extracting several large bills and placing them on the front seat. "Thank you, I need to run."

Without waiting for a response, I pushed the door open and plunged into the night.

My leather shoes struck the pavement in a rhythmic pattern as I
unfastened my suit jacket and loosened my tie, running at full speed.Years of morning jogs were paying off, but my heart still raced at an alarming rate-not just from physical exertion, but from the profound
worry about Annie's safety that gripped my core.

Passersby cast surprised glances at the well-dressed man sprinting through the streets, but I had no time for their curiosity. My mind focused on a single goal-finding Annie and ensuring her safety.

Suddenly, my phone vibrated in my pocket. Still running, I pulled it out to see Robert's number on the screen. I immediately answered.

"Howard," surprisingly, Sarah's voice came through, unnervingly calm."You soundout of breath. Haven't found Annie yet?"
I slowed slightly, breathing heavily, "Sarah, tell me where Lucy and Brian are."

A soft laugh echoed through the phone. "Asking about the children now?I'm afraid it's too late for Annie,Howard."
"What do you mean?" My voice dropped dangerously low,fingers tightening around the phone. The implication behind her words sent ice

through my veins. "If you harm even a single hair on Lucy's head..."

"Don't threaten me. Howard," Sarah interrupted, a hint of satisfaction in her tone. "I didn't call to give you information. I'm just curious why you didn't go to the old pier in Long Island as instructed?"

I clenched my jaw and continued moving, realizing Sarah's call was likely meant to delay me. "Where are Lucy and Brian?"

"I told you. they're with me," Sarah's voice suddenly sharpened. "Both children are with me! Did you think you could break my rules and get away with it?"


Just as I was about to hang up, I heard a sudden commotion on the other end-sounds of a struggle, objects falling, and muffled shouts. There was no way to know what was happening, but it sounded like Robert might be attempting something desperate.

Then the call abruptly disconnected. My instincts told me the children were likely at the lighthouse keeper's cabin, but I had no time to worry about what might be happening there; Annie needed me now. If Sarah's ominous "too late" meant what I feared, every second counted.

I immediately pocketed my phone and quickened my pace. Robert's message confirmed my suspicions-Sarah wasn't working alone, and Annie might be in even greater danger.

Fifteen minutes of intense running brought me to my destination.The abandoned factory on Fifth Street loomed like a sleeping beast, particularly ominous in the darkness. "Danger, Keep Out" signs hung on the dilapidated walls, but I unhesitatingly climbed over, landing in a cloud of dust.

The factory complex was more extensive than I'd imagined, with several rust-covered buildings scattered across the overgrown grounds. Sarah had specified "the abandoned factory" but hadn't indicated which building.Scanning the area. I decided to start with the main structure.


In the darkness, the factory's silhouette appeared especially eerie, its uneven windowslike lifeless faces silently watching the uninvited visitor.I carefully avoided broken glass and metal debris on the ground,moving swiftly toward the main building.

"Is Annie okay?" I whispered to myself, Sarah's words "too late" echoing in my mind, making my heart sink. I fought to banish the worst scenarios from my thoughts, focusing instead on the search ahead.

Pushing open the heavy metal door. I entered the dark interior. The smell of mold. dust, and damp air hit me immediately. I took out my phone and activated the flashlight, illuminating the corridor ahead. My normally impeccable appearance was now covered in dust, face streaked with sweat,but my gaze remained sharp as a hawk's.

"Annie?" I called softly, my voice echoing through the empty building.No response.

I regulated my breathing and began systematically searching the interior.The first floor was a large production area with machinery covered in thick dust. I quickly moved through,checking every potential hiding place.
The stairs to the second floor were partially collapsed, and I carefully stepped on what appeared to be stable treads. The second floor seemed to have been an office area, with faded safety posters hanging on partition walls and desks and filing cabinets scattered haphazardly.
"Annie!" My calls grew more urgent, but only my echo answered.

A terrifying thought crossed my mind what if Annie wasn't here at all?What if Sarah's instructions were just a ruse to separate Annie and me.leaving us both vulnerable to danger?

Just then, I heard a faint noise, like metal scraping against the floor.coming from a room at the end of the hallway. Immediately alert, I silently approached the source.

When I carefully pushed open the final door, my heart nearly stopped beating.

In the dim room, moonlight streamed through broken windows,illuminating a figure on the bed. Annie lay naked, curled up, with ropes cutting deeply into her wrists and ankles, leaving angry red marks. Her golden hair was disheveled, partially covering her face, and bruises were visible on her body.

A horrifying thought flashed through my mind: "Was Annie raped?" The idea pierced my heart like a sharp knife, making it difficult to breathe,my body rigid with shock.

Sarah's cold words "too late" echoed in my ears as unprecedented rage and fear simultaneously washed over me. I stepped forward, my throat tight with emotion.

###Chapter 258: Think About It

Annie's POV

The coarse ropes dug deeply into my wrists and ankles as I curled up on that decrepit bed. The drug-induced haze had finally cleared from my mind, leaving behind a dull headache and a sharp awareness of my dangerous situation. I tested the bindings discreetly,feeling the rough fibers scratch against my already raw skin. The abandoned factory's musty air filled my lungs with each careful breath I took.

Philip stood a few steps away, phone in hand, uncertainty flashing across his face after my revelation about Sarah's baby. In the dim light, his familiar features seemed contorted into someone I barely recognized. The moonlight streaming through broken windows cast elongated shadows across the dusty floor, turning the room into something from a nightmare.

"Philip, call her again," I urged, my voice steady despite the panic coursing through me. "Ask her directly if the child is yours."
Philip's finger hovered over his phone screen, doubt gradually crawling across his expression. I could see the internal struggle playing out on his face-the desperate need to believe inSarah battling against the seed of suspicion I'd planted. He dialed Sarah's number again but only reached her voicemail. The unanswered call seemed to amplify the tension in the room, the electronic beeps echoing off the dilapidated walls.
"She's not answering," he muttered, frustration evident in his voice.He ran his fingers through his disheveled hair, a gesture I'd seen countless times during our marriage. "It doesn't matter anyway."
"It does matter," I insisted, shifting slightly to relieve the pressure of the bindings on my wrists. The pain helped keep my mind clear,focused."

Then call Robert. Ask him about Paris."

Philip's eyes narrowed with suspicio. "You're just stalling, aren't you?"

He stepped closer, still clutching the cloth soaked with sedative. The chemical smell wafted toward me, making my stomach turn. I fought back memories of waking up disoriented in this very room, determined to stay present, to find a way out.

"I'mm not falling for your tricks, Annie." Philip's voice had taken on that cold. detached tone I'd heard more and more in our final months together-the voice of a stranger wearing my husband's face.

"Philip, what exactly do you plan to do?" I asked, unable to hide the tremor in mny voice. Part of me didn't want to know the answer,but I needed to keep him talking, to buy time.

Philip placed his phone on the table beside the camera tripod. The camera's lens caught the dim light, reflecting it back like a malevolent eye watching our every move.

"I've thought this through," he began, his voice unnervingly calmn as he adjusted the camera settings. "Howard Thompson took everything from me-my wife, my family, my dignity. He swooped in like some knight in shíning armnor and stole what was mine."

He adjusted the camera, ensuring it pointed directly at the bed where I was bound. His fingers moved with practiced precision despite the tremor I could detect in his hands. "So I'm going to take something from him."
A wave of nausea swept over me as I fully understood his intention. The room seemed to spin momentarily, and I fought to maintain my composure. "You can't be serious," I whispered, my voice barely audible

even to my own ears.

"I'm going to record everything." Philip continued, gesturing toward the camera. His voice had taken on an almost clinical detachment. "Then Howard has a choice-either he uses his company's resources to save my company from bankruptcy, or this video goes public."

My blood ran cold. The calculation behind his plan was chilling. "Philip,this is rape. You'll go to prison."

He laughed, a hollow sound devoid of humor that echoed through the empty room. "You think I care about that anymore? My company is failing,my son hates me, and my wife left me for another man. What else do I have to lose?"

The desperation in his voice was palpable. I recognized the dangerous edge to it-the voice of someone who believed they had nothing left to lose was the most frightening sound in the world.

"You think this will hurt Howard?" I challenged, desperately trying to make him see reason. I needed to reach whatever humanity remained in him. "He'll only hate you more."

Philip's expression darkened, his features tightening in a way that momentarily made me recoil. "Oh, it will hurt him in ways you can't imagine." He leaned closer, his voice dropping to an intense whisper."Even if he initially forgives you, knowing it wasn't your choice... every time he tries to touch you, he'll remember this moment. These images will flash in his mind. Your relationship will rot from the inside."
The calculated cruelty behind his plan rendered me momentarily speechless. This wasn't just about revenge-it was about systematic destruction, about poisoning any chance of happiness I might find in the

future. The Philip I married would never have conceived of something so vicious.

"Was this Sarah's idea?" I finally asked, connecting the dots. The manipulation, the psychological warfare-it hadI Sarah's fingerprints all over it. "This feels like her manipulation."

Philip's hesitation confirmed my suspicion before he could deny it.Something flickered in his eyes-doubt,perhaps, or the first glimmer of clarity. "Sarah understands what it takes to win," he defended, but his voice lacked conviction.


"Why are you doing her dirty work?" I pressed on, sensing his vulnerability. I needed to widen that crack of doubt. "The child in her belly isn't even yours, Philip."

"You're lying," he snapped, but uncertainty flickered in his eyes like a candle flame in the wind. His hand clenched and unclenched at his side,betraying his inner turmoil.

I took a deep breath, choosing my words carefully. This might be my only chance."Remember when I was kidnapped? When you drugged me and handed me over to Robert?" The memory still burned, but I forced myself to continue. "I found Sarah's phone that morning. I saw her messages with Robert about their weekend in Paris. I saw her lab results-nine weeks pregnant, when you hadn't even touched her."

Philip paled, and for a moment he seemed unsteady on his feet. "That's impossible. Sarah wouldn't-" He stopped mid-sentence, and I could see him mentally revisiting moments, conversations, perhaps noticing inconsistencies he'd previously ignored.
"The same Sarah who turned our son against me?" I questioned, my voice

strengthening with each word. "The same Sarah who orchestrated my kidnapping? Wake up. Philip. She's been using both of us."

Philip's hand tightened around the sedative-soaked cloth as he took a threatening step toward me. "Shut up. You're trying to confuse me. This f exactly what Howard would want you to say,"

"Think about it," I continued, ignoring his advance. I refused to show fear.though my heart pounded painfully against my ribs. "Why would Robert agree to that kidnapping scheme? This isn't about wanting me-it's about him and Sarah using us as pawns in their game."

A flicker of doubt crossed Philip's face. His hand, still holding the cloth,lowered slightly. For the first time since this nightmare began, I saw genuine uncertainty in his eyes.

"If you don't believe me, call Robert," I suggested,my voice softening.I knew I was gambling everything on this moment, on Philip's capacity for rational thought. "Ask him about Paris. Ask him about the baby. What do you have to lose by making one phone call?"

Philip stood frozen in indecision, my words clearly affecting him. The camera was ready, the ropes still biting into my skin, but I sensed a shift in the atmosphere. The momentum was changing, the careful script Sarah had prepared beginning to unravel.

###Chapter 259: Wrest Back What Belonged t Me

Philip's POV

I stood before Annie, my world crumbling around me. Her words about Sarah's pregnancy echoed in my mind like shards of broken glass, each syllable cutting deeper than the last. The possibility that the child wasn't mine-that I'd been manipulated again-was toopainful to accept.

"That's impossible..." My voice trembled despite my efforts to sound confident. "Sarah is carrying my child." Even as I spoke the words,doubt gnawed at me. Was I defending Sarah or desperately clinging to what little remained of my dignity?

Annie's eyes softened with something worse than anger-pity. "Do you really believe that? Why don't you call Robert and confirm?"

The suggestion itself was like acid in an open wound. What if she was right? What if I had been played for a fool again? First by Annie, then by Sarah? The thought made my chest constrict painfully.

I bit my lower lip, hand reaching for my phone with reluctance. Just then,it vibrated in my pocket as if summoned by our conversation. Sarah's name flashed across the screen. I answered immediately, desperate for reassurance but dreading what I might hear.
"Philip!" Sarah's voice came through, urgent and tense. "Howard isn't coming. He went to find Annie. Proceed with the plan immediately!"
My throat tightened as I clutched the phone, knuckles turning white.The question that had been poisoning my mind forced its way out. "Sarah, tell me the truth. Whose baby are you carrying?"


The silence that followed was deafening. In that brief pause, my entire world shifted on its axis. Each millisecond of hesitation from her was a nail in the coffin of my self-respect.

"This isn't the time to discuss that!" she finally snapped, impatience evident in her tone. "I'm trying to deal with Robert here, but I'll try to delay Howard. He could arrive any minute. Move quickly!"

The call ended abruptly, leaving me standing there with the phone feeling impossibly heavy in my hand. A cold realization settled in my stomach like lead. Sarah's non-answer was answer enough. The child wasn't mine.I had been a pawn in her game all along.

"What did Sarah say?" Annie asked, her voice calm but wary.

I didn't answer immediately. I slipped the phone back into my pocket, my expression betraying the storm raging within. Sarah hadn't denied Annie's accusation. Her ambiguous response hurt more than an outright confession.


My mind flashed back to all the intimate moments we'd shared, all her whispered promises-had any of it been real? Or was I just a convenient stepping stone in her pursuit of Howard Thompson?
"She said the baby is mine," I finally replied, my voice hollow,lacking conviction-I couldn't even convince myself of this lie. The words tasted bitter on my tongue, like ashes of everything I thought I had.
Annie shook her head, those intelligent eyes seeing right through me."Your face tells me you already know the answer."
Her words broke the last of my restraint. Years of accumulated frustration,betrayal, and anger erupted at once. The humiliation of being manipulated

by both my es-wife and my lover crashed over me in waves. I had built my identity around being a successful businessman,a man in control, but the truth was painfully clear-I was nothing but a puppet whose strings were pulled by women who saw me as a means to an end.

"Shut up!" I roared, my face contorting with rage, blood rushing to my head. "This is all your fault If you hadn't left me, if you'd just been a good wife, none of this would have happened!"

Even as the words left my mouth. I knew they were unfair, but I needed someone to blame. I couldn't bear the thought that I was the architect of my own misfortune.

I lunged toward Annie, roughly grabbing her arm. She struggled against me. but the ropes binding her limited her movement. Her skin felt familiar under my fingertips-a reminder of the years we'd spent together, years now tainted by betrayal and resentment.

"What are you doing?" she asked, alarm rising in her voice asshe watched me begin to loosen my tie with trembling fingers.

"Since everything is over anyway," my voice dropped to a dangerous low,revenge and lust mixing into a toxic cocktail in my veins, "I might as well enjoy your body one last time."

The thought was intoxicating-taking back control, proving I still had power over something, over someone. If I couldn't have Annie's love or Sarah's loyalty, I would take what little satisfaction I could.
Annie's eyes widened, a flash of fear crossing her face before hardening into defiance. "You've lost your mind! Do you really want to destroy your life?"


Her resistance only fueled my determination. "I don't care anymore," I said,removing my suit jacket and tossing it carelessly aside. "Nobody cares about me, so why should I care about anyone else?" My voice cracked slightly, revealing the wounded child beneath the vengeful man.

"Philip Baker, you'll regret this decision for the rest of your life," Annie's voice turned ice-cold, cutting through my haze of anger.

I paused briefly, her words stirring a flicker of unease deep within me.Perhaps she was right-this decision would irrevocably destroy everything.But anger and desperation had already taken control; there was no turning back. I had crossed a line, and the only way was forward.

"Maybe." I continued unbuttoning my shirt, exposing my chest to the cool air of the abandoned factory. "But since I'm about to lose everything anyway, I might as well enjoy one final pleasure."

I removed my clothes piece by piece, each item discarded taking me further from rationality. My tie, my shirt, my belt-symbols of the respectable man I once pretended to be. By the time I stood completely naked before Annie, I was consumed by darkness, stripped not just of clothing but of humanity.

I reached out to remove Annie's clothes, my movements rough and urgent,ignoring her protests. She fought back fiercely, twisting and turning despite her bonds, her resistance only heightening my perverse determination.

"Stop it!" Annie shouted, her voice filled with anger and fear. "This isn't who you are, Philip! Think about Brian! What would he think if he saw his father like this?"
The mention of our son sent a jolt through me, but I pushed it aside.

"How would you know who I am?" I sneered, continuing to tear at her clothing. "You never really knew me. Annie. None of you did."

As Annie's body was gradually exposed to the cool air, I paused, my gaze becoming unfocused. Looking at her once-familiar form, memories flooded back unbidden. Our first date. Our wedding night. The birth of Brian.There was a time when we loved each other, respected each other, created beautiful memories together. Now it had all devolved into this nightmare-me standing naked. preparing to commit an act I could never take back.

The realization of what I was doing began to penetrate the fog of my rage.This wasn't about desire; it was about vengeance, about hurting Annie the way I had been hurt. But even as I recognized this truth, part of me wanted to continue, to prove I still had some control in a world that had reduced me to nothing.

I began touching myself, trying to arouse desire. A flicker of my former self briefly surfaced-this was wrong, this was beneath me-but I pushed those thoughts aside. What did "right" and "wrong" matter anymore? The world had proven itself devoid of justice. Sarah had betrayed me. Annie had abandoned me. I deserved retribution.

My movement was getting urgent as I fed my anger. Images flashed through my mind: Annie and Howard together, Sarah and Robert laughing at my expense, my reputation in ruins. Each humiliation fueled my determination to reclaim some form of control, to inflict a fraction of the pain I'd endured.

I stared at Annie's partially exposed body, steeling my resolve. Yes,I would do this. I would take what little satisfaction remained available to me in this life that had become a mockery of my ambitions.
And when Howard Thompson eventually found us, he would know that I

had marked what he treasured, just as he had taken what was mine.


###Chapter 260: I'm Sorry

Annie's POV

The air in the abandoned factory hung heavy and suffocating, thick with dust and the acrid scent of desperation. Moonlight filtered through broken windows, casting long shadows across the room as I lay bound on the decrepit bed. I could feel Philip's gaze roaming over my body, a disturbing mixture of desperation and predatory intent. Just moments ago,he had been questioning Sarah's loyalty; now he had descended completely into madness and revenge.

"You think Howard will still want you? After I'm done with you?" Philip's voice was a twisted whisper emanating from his naked form.

I struggled desperately against my restraints, the ropes cutting deeper into my skin with each movement. The pain shot through my wrists and ankles, but I refused to show weakness. "Philip, for the last time, this won't solve anything. Think about what you're doing."

He laughed, a hollow sound devoid of any warmth that echoed against the factory walls. "Solve? I'm long past seeking solutions, Annie. This is the end. The end of everything." His voice cracked on the last word, betraying the brokenness beneath his vengeful facade.

Looking at his expression and movements, I suddenly realized Sarah's scheme was going to succeed. She had manipulated not just me but Philip too,turning us into pawns in her vengeful game.
An unprecedented fear washed over me, not just for myself but for what would happen afterward. Howard was likely rescuing Lucy and Brian now;he couldn't possibly arrive in time to save me.
My thoughis drihed to the children -innocent Luey with her golden curls and sueer silence Brian who had once called me mommy with such love before Sarah poisoned his mind. I jost hoped they were safe, If I had to endure this nightmare. I could accept it as long as the children were unharmed.


"Annie.." Philip suddenly stopped,his brow furrowed in concentration.His hands trembled violently against my skin, his expression shifting from ferocity to confusion, then to something like panic.

I saw a flash of shame eross his eyes, quiekly replaced by anger.

"Damn it!" hecursed,continuing his futile attempts, but his body clearly betrayed his intentions. The more he tried, the more evident his failure became.


Minutes passed like hours in that silent room, the only sounds being Philip's increasingly frustrated breathing and my own pounding heart. Philip's expression transformed from irritation to despair as reality set in. His body remained unresponsive despite his desperate efforts, refusing to cooperate with his darkest intentions.

"Why..." his voice cracked with frustration, sweat beading on his forehead,"must even this be taken from me? Am I nothing now? Nothing at all?"

Philip suddenly released his grip on me, collapsing onto the floor beside the bed like a puppet with cut strings. He buried his face in his hands, his shoulders heaving violently with sobs that seemed torn from his very core.The sight of him-naked, defeated, crumbling before my eyes-stirred a complex mix of emotions: relief, pity, and a strange sense of closure.
"I'm finished..." he muttered, his voice filled with despair that seemed to fill the entire room, "my company, my son, my marriage...now I don't

even have my dignity as a man." His words dissolved into incoherent sobs,his body curled into itself on the dirty factory floor.

Through Philip's broken sobs, I felt a strange relief washing over me.Although still in danger, still bound and vulnerable, the worst seemed to have been avoided. The universe had granted me this small mercy amidst the chaos.


"Philip, untie me." I kept my voice as steady as possible,trying to reach whatever rationality might remain in him. "We can figure out how to resolve all of this. It's not too late to stop this madness."

"Resolve?" he looked up, his face streaked with tears that caught the moonlight. "It's too late, Annie. The baby Sarah's carrying isn't mine-I can see that truth now. My company is about to go bankrupt, Brian hates me,you left me... I have nothing left. Nothing." The last word emerged as barely a whisper.

Just then, the factory door was violently thrown open with a deafening crash that seemed to shake the entire building. Metal hinges screamed in protest, dust swirling in the sudden draft.

"Annie!" Howard's voice echoed through the empty factory, the urgency in it sending shivers down my spine.

When he burst into the room, the world seemed to freeze in a terrible tableau. Howard stood in the doorway, his suit jacket covered in dust, tie loosened,forehead glistening with sweat from his desperate search. When his gaze fell upon my nearly naked form on the bed and Philip's naked body beside it, his expression transformed from anxiety to pure, unbridled rage.


"You goddamn bastard!" Howard roared as he lunged at Philip, his eyes

burning with uncontrollable fury. The controlled,composed CEO was gone.replaced by a primal force of nature.

Howard yanked Philip from the floor with a strength born of rage and delivered a powerful punch to his face. The sound of knuckles connecting with flesh echoed sickeningly in the room. Philip didn't even resist as Howard threw him to the ground, straddled him, and rained down blow after blow with mechanical precision.

"Howard! Stop!" I shouted, terrified Philip would be beaten to death before my eyes. "He didn't succeed! He couldn't do anything! Stop!"

But Howard seemed lost in some kind of rage-induced trance, completely deaf to my voice. His fists continued to fall like hammers, Philip's face quickly becoming bloody and swollen under the onslaught. Each impact made a sound that turned my stomach.

"Howard Thompson!" I shouted with all my strength, my voice cracking with the effort. "Stop! Now! You'll kill him!"

My voice completely dissipated in Howard's frenzy. He couldn't hear my pleas as his fists fell like raindrops, each blow carrying unleashed fury.Philip's face quickly became a bloody mess, his nose streaming blood,facial features beginning to distort, but Howard showed no sign of stopping. A terrifying thought crossed my mind-would I watch Howard become a murderer right before my eyes?
"You animal!" Howard roared, his voice filled with a fury I'd never heard before,each word punctuated by another blow. "How dare you touch her!How dare you even think about it!"
Philip had stopped resisting entirely, only emitting weak groans with each impact. I tried to call out again, but Howard had completely succumbed to

a terrifying state of rage, as if channeling all his anger and fear into destroying the man beneath him.

Suddenly.Howard halted his assault, his fist frozen in mid-air, but not because he'd heard my voice. He turned his head slowly, eyes still blazing with anger. but when his gaze fell on me-bound, vulnerable, frightened-his expression began to soften, humanity returning to his features.

Without waiting for any explanation. Howard immediately released the barely conscious Philip and rushed to the bed. His hands, still smeared with Philip's blood, gently but efficiently untied the ropes binding me. He wrapped his jacket around my body witha such tenderness it brought tears to my eyes.

"Annie, I'm sorry I'm late," his voice trembled with emotion as his hands gently caressed the angry red marks on my wrists, his eyes filled with pain and self-reproach. "I should have been here sooner. I should have known."

He carefully held me in his arms, one hand cradling my head as if I were made of glass,kissing my hair, forehead, and cheeks as if confirming I was really there, safe, alive. "Whatever happened, whatever he did to you, I will accept you, protect you. This isn't your fault." His voice caught on the words,thick with emotion.

I wanted to tell him the truth-that Philip hadn't actually harmed me,that his body had refused to cooperate with his dark intentions-but my throat felt constricted, the words refusing to come. Seeing Howard so determined to rescue me,hearing his unconditional promises, a deep emotion wvelled up inside me that swept away my ability to speak.
He continued softly reassuring me, his lips against my temple:′′It3ssall over.We need to get you out of here, to a hospital for examination. It's over,Annie. It's all over."

"Howard..." I finally spoke, but didn't know where to begin,how to explain the complex reality of what had and hadn't happened in this room.

"Shh, don't talk now," he gently interrupted, brushing a strand of hair from my face with infinite tenderness. "Just rest. I'll be right beside you.Always."


I nestled in his warm embrace, suddenly feeling a wave of exhaustion wash over me that seemed to come from my very bones. Perhaps explanations could wait; for now, I just wanted to savor this sense of security,this promise of protection.

###Chapter 261: An Unimaginable Gamble

Howard's POV

Philip's body lay crumpled on the floor like a heavy sack of sand,consciousness scattered beneath his bloodied, swollen face. My breathing remained rapid, knuckles throbbing from the violence I had just inflicted,but none of that mattered now. A bone-deep chill spread from my spine throughout my entire body-I had arrived too late.

I staggered toward Annie, my knees barely supporting my weight. My heart pounded violently against my ribcage as though trying to break free.The sight of her bound, humiliated, and hurt cut into the depths of my soul like a blade.

"Annie..." My voice emerged broken and low,as if forcibly wrenched from the depths of my soul. Every red mark on her pale skin felt like a scar branded onto my heart.

I carefully wrapped my suit jacket around her exposed body,movements as gentle as if handling a fragile work of art. When I finally took her into my arms, my lips trembled as I kissed the rope marks on her wrists, as if my kisses could erase those painful impressions; then her shoulders, her neck, as if my touch could purify what had been defiled. Each contact was filled with silent remorse-why hadn't I arrived sooner? Why had I allowed this to happen?
"Howard..." Annie's voice penetrated the fog of my emotions, her palm firmly pressed against my chest, halting my further movements. "Not here."
"He didn't succeed," Annie said, her voice steady and clear.

I stared at her, concern replaced by confusion. "What do you mean? I saw

him... he was completely naked, and you -"

"He couldn't go through with it." Annie explained directly,her gaze unwavering. "He tried, but at the last moment, he couldn't... perform.When his body wouldn't cooperate with his intentions, he completely broke down."


The meaning of her words slowly sank in. Philip had attempted to violate her but physically couldin't. Such intense relief swept over me that I felt slightly dizzy as I pulled Annie back into my embrace.

"Thank God..." My lips pressed against her hair that carried a faint scent,my voice barely audible even to myself as if I'd just survived a near-death experience. "Thank God..."

My fingers gently lifted her chin as my lips sought hers with almost reverent devotion. then her cheeks, the space between her eyebrows,the hollow of her neck. each kiss carrying the fervor of renewed life. Knowing she had been spared that irreparable harm filled my chest with gratitude bordering on euphoría, like a parched desert suddenly drenched by torrential rain.

Annie's palm gently pushed against my chest, this time with a glimmer of playfulness in her eyes, the corner of her mouth lifting in a slight smile,like the last starlight before dawn. "Howard, whatever plan you're formulating in your mind can wait until we're safely home."
Then her expression turned serious,her gaze sharp as a hawk's. "What about Lucy and Brian? Are they safe?"
Her question was like a bucket of ice water, instantly pulling me from the emotional whirlpool back to harsh reality. The children.,. yes. I almost cursed myself for momentarily forgetting. I carefully helped Annie secure


the jacket. ensuring it adequately covered her body, then sat on the edge of the dilapidated bed, which groaned in protest as if responding to all the evil that had transpired in this abandoned factory.

"I'm not certain yet." I admitted softly, gently cradling her hands in mine,feeling the slight tremor in her fingertips. My thumbs drew small, soothing circles on the backs of her hands, as if this might calm our shared anxiety."When Sarah called, something felt... wrong." My gaze sharpened,recalling my instinctive judgment in that moment: "She demanded we separate, you to Brooklyn, me to Long Island. In that instant, I realized this was a carefully designed trap, and you... were the primary target."

Moonlight cast upon Annie's pale face illuminated the fear and concern welling in her eyes. Her breathing quickened: "So you disobeyed her instructions, coming here instead of going to the pier?" Her voice dropped almost to a whisper, as if afraid of the answer: "But what about the children? What about Lucy and Brian?"

I felt the weight on my shoulders grow heavier. In that decisive moment,I had faced an unimaginable choice-Annie or Lucy, my lover or my niece,two lives equally precious to me.
My Adam's apple bobbed as I swallowed with difficulty: "I sent Robert to the pier in my place." Seeing the shock in Annie's eyes,I continued:"I knew it was a gamble, a bet on Sarah's limits. I couldn't bear the thought of you possibly facing Philip alone."
My voice involuntarily darkened; "And my instinct... told me Sarah wouldn't truly harm the children. To someone like her,children are more valuable as leverage alive than dead."
Annie's eyes widened, "That was an... unimaginable gamble, Howard."

My gaze briefly fell to the floor, to Philip's body beginning to stir with returning consciousness, then back to Annie's face. My voice was low,filled with painful honesty, "It is."

Admitting this sent a sharp pain through me, like acknowledging my own powerlessness. "But I analyzed Sarah's behavior patterns over the past few months. She wouldni't destroy her leverage prematurely." Mygaze darkened further: "And... I knew better than anyone about Philip's obsession with you. He never accepted that you chose me. I knew...I knew what he would do to you. That's why I had to come here."

Annie looked toward Philip on the floor, moonlight and shadow intertwining on his bloodied face, creating a disturbing portrait. Bruises had begun forming around his eyes, his lips swollen almost beyond recognition, his nose bridge clearly broken, darkred blood congealing on his chin and neck.

I looked down at my own hands-knuckles swollen and split,covered in blood that had begun to dry. Looking at these hands that normally signed contracts and stroked Lucy's golden curls, I confronted the terrible truth deep within myself for the first time.

My voice was surprisingly calm, yet carried an unfamiliar coldness:"I would have killed him." This admission shocked even me, but on some level, I knew it was true. "If you hadn't called me to stop... I believe I would have continued until he stopped breathing completely."
The air between us seemed to grow heavy with this terrible confession.Before becoming Lucy's guardian and meeting Annie, I had never imagined such violent potential existed within me. This knowledge both terrified and reassured me-terrified by the darkness lurking in my depths,reassured knowing I could unhesitatingly cross that line to protect those I

loved.

Annie's hand gently covered mine, warm and firm, pulling me from this dark spiral of thoughts. Her voice was soft yet decisive: "We need to call Robert now, Howard," Her gaze regained that focus and clarity I knew well.that quality of remaining even more composed during crises. "We must confirm whether Lucy and Brian are safe."

I nodded,grateful she had redirected my attention to the most urgent matter at hand. I pulled my phone from my pocket, fingers still trembling slightly from the violence. Philip emitted a low groan from the floor,his body beginning to move slightly as consciousness gradually returned, but I completely ignored him as if he were merely apiece of broken furniture in the corner of the room. I dialed Robert's number, put it on speaker, and placed the phone between Annie and me.

The ringtone echoed through the silent abandoned factory, each tonelike an anxious mark drawn across endless darkness. Finally, after the fourth ring. the call connected, and Robert's voice came through the speaker,sounding both tense and urgent, with children's small voices and distant sirens in the background: "Howard! Thank God you finally called. I've been desperately trying to reach you."
Annie and I both tensed, my voice almost forced through clenched teeth,"Are the children safe? Lucy and Brian?" This was the only question that mattered now, as if the entire universe awaited this answer.
The brief pause on the other end nearly stopped my heart, then Robert's voice sounded again: "Yes, they're safe." I felt Annie's entire body relax beside me, her breath shaking as if she finally dared to breathe.Robert continued: "Lucy and Brian are both here with me. But..," his voice suddenly grew heavy, as if burdened by something unspeakable, "Sarah...

there was an accident."

"What kind of accident?" I asked, my voice low and tense, an ominous feeling spreading in my chest.


Robert's sigh came clearly through the phone, the background sirens seemingly closer: "She... she had a gun, Howard." His voice became fragmented, as if each word was painfully pulled from the depths of his soul. "She was pointing it at me, threatening to harm the children if I didn't cooperate. I... we struggled, and the gun... the gun went off." A painful sound escaped his throat: "The bullet hit her abdomen,Howard.The ambulance just took her away, but it looks... it looks really bad."

A heavy silence, like an invisible blanket, enveloped Annie and me.Despite the terrible things Sarah had done, despite how she had nearly destroyed our lives, no one wanted to see such an ending. That unborn child was innocent, and now, its life might have ended before it even began.

"The children..." Annie's voice trembled almost beyond recognition,and she had to bite her lower lip before continuing: "They didn't see any of this happen, did they?" Her question contained an instinctive maternal concern, that desire to protect children from the world's darkness clearly audible in her voice.
Robert's low voice came through the phone, carrying a hint of relief: "No.thank goodness." He paused, his voice tinged with subtle surprise: "In fact,they...they had already untied themselves with Max's help."
Thank God, everyone was safe.



###Chapter 262: New Beginnings

Annie's POV

The ambulance sirens finally ceased, though the harsh red and blue lights continued to dance across the hospital's glass doors. I clutched Howard's suit jacket tightly around my body, trying to cover the marks I wished I could forget. From that abandoned factory in Brooklyn to here. Howard's hand had remained firmly clasped around mine, as if afraid I might disappear if he let go. His protective warmth reassured me, yet I still struggled to believe we were truly safe.

The hospital's antiseptic smell hit me as we entered-that sharp, clean scent suddenly seemed beautiful and comforting. Perhaps the nightmare I'd just endured made even this sterile odor feel like a welcome relief.

"Are you sure you don't need to be examined first?" Howard asked softly,his gray eyes filled with emotions I couldn't fully decipher-concern,guilt,anger,and something deeper.

I shook my head. Despite the pain throughout my body, despite the rope burns that still throbbed around my wrists and ankles, my heart had only one priority: "I'm fine. I just need to see Lucy."

Philip's face flashed through my mind-once familiar features that now terrified me like a stranger's. I forced myself not to think about his naked body and those malevolent eyes. Now wasn't the time to fall apart. Lucy needed me. Brian needed me too, even if he didn't realize it yet.
Pushing through the emergency room's double doors, my eyes immediately scanned the entire space. In the corner, Robert sat on a plastic chair with Max asleep on his lap. Brian sat nearby, head down, his golden hair making him look so vulnerable. And then I saw her-my Lucy,my little

angel with golden hair and blue eyes, sitting in a chair with her small hands cloiching her dress as if ready to flee at any moment.

"Lacy!" My voice trembled with emotion, almost unrecognizable to my own ears.

When she looked up at me, time seemed to stop. The fear in those blue eyes instantly transformed into pure joy, an emotion so genuine it nearly stopped my heart. She leapt from her chair and rushed across the waiting area.practically flying into my arms.

"Mommy!"

That single word shattered all my defenses. Tears flowed uncontrollably as I knelt down and held her tightly against my chest, feeling her tiny heartbeat synchronize with mine.

"My baby, you're safe now. Everything will be alright," I promised softly,kissing her golden hair. In that moment, it felt like the world contained only us-Philip's threats, the factory's terror, the pain of the ropes-all became distant and blurred.

I sensed Howard standing nearby,giving us space while providing an invisible shield of protection. I heard him asking Robert about Sarah's condition. Though I barely cared about the woman who had nearly destroyed my life, I knew the innocent life she carried and tonight's events were heartbreaking on every level.
Two police officers entered the waiting area, requesting statements from the adults. A series of incidents needed explanation-the abandoned factory in Brooklyn, the pier on Long Island, Sarah's gunshot wound,the children's kidnapping. The law would assign blame,but the scars would take time to heal.

"T'll give my statement. You stay here with the children," Howard told me,his warm hand gently caressing my cheek, a touch I wanted to lean into forever.


"What about Philip?" I asked, not because I cared about his condition, but because I needed to know if he still posed a threat.

"I've arranged security to monitor him. He should be in another ward receiving treatment," Howard replied, his voice carrying a coldness I'd never heard before. "Don't worry, he can't hurt you anymore."

I squeezed his hand gently before letting go. "Okay." That simple syllable contained all my trust and dependence. This once cold and powerful CEO had become my safe harbor, the pillar of our family.

Hospital staff arranged a more comfortable pediatric waiting area for the children,with colorful low tables and toys. Max had awakened and sat in the corner playing with blocks, occasionally glancing confusedly toward the hallway. probably looking for Sarah. The child's innocence contrasted sharply with Sarah's crimes, and I couldn't blame a child for any of this.

Lucy refused to leave my embrace, her small hands clutching my clothes as if afraid I might vanish. I understood her fear-tonight had been an unimaginable nightmare for a five-year-old.
"Lucy, darling, I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere," I promised softly,burying my nose in her soft golden hair, inhaling the familiar scent of her shampoo. Somehow, that fragrance made everything feel real-we truly were safe; this wasn't some hallucination or dream in that factory.
I noticed Brian sitting several steps away, stealing glances at Lucy and me.He had once been my son, the infant who slept on my chest, the little boy whose first word was "Mama." He had betrayed me when I was most

vulnerable, but after everything that happened tonight, perhaps we could find a path to reconciliation within our shared trauma.

I tried to smile at him. "Would you like to come sit with us,Brian?"

He bit his lip, the hesitation in his eyes reminding me of when he was learning to walk-wanting to try but afraid to fail. "I'm sorry," he whispered, those two words carrying too many emotions for me to fully comprehend.


Fighting back fresh tears, I maintained a calm expression. "It's okay, Brian.”


I carefully extended one hand, avoiding any sudden movements that might frighten him. "Would you like to come over? There's space right next to Lucy."

Time stretched endlessly during his hesitation. My heart pounded so violently it felt like it might break free from my chest. Finally, he slowly,tentatively approached and sat beside me. When my arm gently encircled his shoulders, he didn't pull away-this small acceptance nearly made me cry again.

In this moment, despite sitting in a hospital waiting room, despite all the terrible events of the night, I felt hope blossoming in my heart. Lucy on my right. Brian on my left-I finally had both children, my children. The world outside might still be dangerous, and more challenges might lie ahead,but right now, we had taken our first step as a family.
I looked toward the doorway, somehow sensing Howard's imminent return.Whatever awaited us, we would face it together. This was an ending, but also a beginning-a new beginning.

###Chapter 263: Aftermath

Howard's POV

The corridors of New York General Hospital were quiet in the middle of the night, with only the soft glow from the nurses' station and occasional whispers breaking the silence. I'd just finished speaking with the police and was walking back to the room, exhaustion weighing heavily on my shoulders.

When I gently pushed open the door, the sight before me warmed my heart despite everything. Annie lay asleep on the hospital bed, her golden hair spread across the white pillow. Lucy's small body was nestled tightly against Annie's side, as if afraid someone might separate them again.Brian was curled up in the armchair nearby, tear stains still visible on his vulnerable face.

I stood quietly in the doorway, unwilling to disturb this rare moment of peace. The night's events replayed in my mind like a nightmare-Sarah's threatening call, finding Annie in that abandoned factory, the violence I'd inflicted on Philip. The last one particularly disturbed me. When I saw Philip standing naked before an equally exposed Annie, a rage I couldn't control had nearly destroyed the self-discipline I'd always prided myself on.

"I could have killed him," I admitted silently. "If Annie hadn't called me to stop, I might have..."
I'd made an almost unimaginable choice-between Lucy and Annie,I chose to go directly to Annie. Though the outcome proved this decision correct,guilt still weighed on my heart like a stone.
"William," I silently addressed my deceased brother, "when I took Lucy's

guardianship. I swore to protect her above my own life. Tonight, I almost failed that promise."


My thoughts returned to that stormy night three years ago when news of the yacht accident struck like lightning-William and his wife dead, only Lucy surviving. When I first saw that golden-haired, blue-eyed littlegirl with empty eyes in the hospital. I knew my life would never be the same.

On the bed, Annie shifted slightly, and I immediately held my breath,concerned I might wake her. Onlywhen she continued breathing evenly did I relax. White bandages wrapped her wrists, covering the marks left by the ropes. Seeing those bandages caused a sharp pain, as if those wounds were on my own body.

"I promise." I whispered, "Tll never let anyone hurt you again."

I sat down on the sofa, determined to keep watch all night. But exhaustion eventually won, pulling me into light sleep until morning sunlight filtered through the curtains.

The next morning, I stood at the hospital cafeteria counter, dark circles revealing my sleepless night, but my posture remained straight, refusing to yield to fatigue.

"Mr. Thompson?" A doctor in a white coat approached. "Do you have a moment?"

I nodded and followed him to a quiet corner table.

"Ms. Baker's physical condition is stable," the doctor said,reviewing his notes, "The abrasions on her wrists and ankles have been treated. As for psychological aspects, being an adult, Ms. Baker should recover relatively well."

"That's good news," I replied, feeling slightly relleved."And the children?Are they alright?"

"Neither child shows significant physical injuries," the doctor continued,his tone lighter. "Since nothing too severe actually occurred,their psychological trauma should be limited. Lucy is currently somewhat dependent on Ms. Baker, but that's a normal reaction after last night's events. Brian seems to be adapting well. Overall, I believe they'lI return to normal soon."

"However," he added, "consulting with professional psychologists would be beneficial if any issues arise later. I can recommend several child psychologists if needed."

I nodded appreciatively. "Thank you for your advice. I'll contact top specialists immediately if necessary. But I believe that with enough love and support, they'll recover quickly."

My phone vibrated with an update from the police:

"Philip Baker has been formally arrested, facing multiple charges:kidnapping, unlawful detention, and attempted sexual assault. He's currently receiving treatment under police supervision for facial and jaw fractures requiring surgery,"
My expression remained unchanged, but my fingers tightened around my coffee cup. Remembering Philip's face bloodied by my fists, I felt no remorse, only a strange disconnection from my uncontrolled anger. I'd always been known for my calm rationality, but last night I'd been someone else entirely.
Another message arrived: "Sarah Johnson's surgery is complete.The fetus couldn't be saved, but she's stable and wilI regain consciousness soon.

Police are waiting outside her room to formally charge her."

Despite Sarah being the mastermind behind everything, the loss of an innocent life still weighed heavily on me. As I contemplated these complex emotions, I saw Robert Johnson enter the cafeteria, pale-faced with bloodshot eyes. He hesitated upon seeing me, then approached.

"Brought you coffee," Robert said hoarsely, placing a steaming cup before me. "Probably not as good as what you have at your company."

I accepted it with a slight nod, gesturing for him to sit. "Thank you. You look terrible."


"Been waiting outside surgery all night," Robert gave a bitter smile. "Sarah's recovering. Doctors say... she lost too much blood, it doesn't look good."His voice trembled slightly. "Our baby didn't..." He couldn't finish.

Silence stretched between us until I broke it: "I'm sorry to hear that.Whatever Sarah did,that child was innocent."

Robert rubbed his tired eyes. "I keep thinking, if I hadn't told Sarah about that fake account, if I'd told you about her reaction sooner...maybe none of this would have happened."
"We all underestimated her obsession," I said calmly. "But assigning blame now is pointless. What matters is moving forward."
"What about Max?" Robert suddenly asked, voice filled with concern. "If Sarah... if the worst happens, Max only has me. What kind of life can a father like me provide?"
I looked directly into Robert's eyes. "Don't underestimate yourself, Robert.You saved three children last night. That proves you're braver than you think."

Gratitude flickered in Robert's eyes, quickly replaced by guilt. "At the cost of my own child's life."


"That was a tragic accident," I said firmly. "You were protecting those children."


"We were all manipulated by Sarah, weren't we?" Robert gave a bitter smile."You, me, Philip... she moved us like chess pieces, exploiting our weaknesses."


I reflected briefly, then said. "Perhaps it's time to end this cycle. Whatever Sarah's fate, we can't let her actions continue affecting our lives, especially the children's."

Robert nodded, new determination in his eyes. "You're right. Max needs a stable father, not someone wallowing in guilt and self-pity."

The ringing phone at the nurses' station interrupted our conversation.A nurse hurried over: "Mr. Thompson? Ms. Baker is awake and asking for you."

I immediatelystood, nodding to Robert before walking quickly toward Annie's room, my heart accelerating with both anticipation and nervousness.

When I gently opened the door, Annie was awake, leaning against the headboard. Lucy still slept beside her, small face nestled in the crook of Annie's neck. Brian was already awake, sitting in a chair by the window,eyes red but calmer than last night.
"Hey," Annie smiled when she saw me, her voice still tired but with returning sparkle in her eyes. "You look like you haven't slept all night."
I walked to her bedside, carefully taking her hand, avoiding the bandaged

wounds. "I'm fine. How are you feeling?"

"Like I've been run over by a truck," Annie attempted to joke, though her smile couldn't hide the shadows in her eyes. "But I'll bealright. When did the doctor say we can go home?"


"As soon as the doctor confirms you're stable, we can leave," I answered softly,glancing at the sleeping Lucy.

Annie considered this, then nodded. "Sounds good. But Brian..." Her gaze shifted to the boy by the window.

I followed her gaze. "Brian can come too, if he wants."

Hearing his name, Brian looked uup uncertainly. Annie smiled gently at him. "Would you like to come with us to Long Island? Just for a few days,until everything... gets back to normal."

Brian hesitated,considering the offer, then quietly asked, "What about Dad?Where is he?"

Annie and I exchanged glances, and I cleared my throat. "Brian, your father... he's dealing with some trouble right now. He can't be with you for a while."

Brian bit his lip, tears welling in his eyes again. "Is it because of what he did to Mom?"

Annie drew a sharp breath, startled by Brian's perceptiveness. She carefully chose her words: "Some bad things happened, Brian. But what's important is that everyone's safe now, and we'll get through this difficult time together."
Brian remained silent for a moment, then nodded slightly. "Okay,I want

to go to Long Island."

Just then, Lucy woke up, seeing me by the bed, she immediately reached out her small hands for me to hold her. Without hesitation, I lifted her into my arms, and she hugged my neck tightly, whispering, "I was so scared. Will the bad people come back?"

I felt a sharp pain in my chest as I gently stroked Lucy's golden curls. "No,baby. The bad people can't hurt you anymore. I promise."

Lucy extended one hand toward Annie. "Annie?"

"I'm right here," Annie took Lucy's small hand. "We'll all be together as a family."

Looking at Annie and Lucy's clasped hands, then at the thoughtful Brian by the window, a firm resolve filled my heart. This newly formed family had been tested by fire, but I would ensure that what rose from these ashes would be stronger, closer bonds.

###Chapter 264:True Beonging

Annie's POV

The children had finally fallen asleep, and I found myself drawn to the balcony of the master bedroom in Howard's Long Island mnansion.The distant sound of Atlantic waves crashing against the shore provided a soothing backdrop as city lights cast shimmering reflections on the dark water. Howard joined me, offering a glass of red wine. We stood in comfortable silence, savoring this rare moment of peace.

Howard noticed my silence and gently took my hand. "What are you thinking about?"

"Just how after everything, we can finally breathe," I smiled, though I knew my eyes still held a trace of worry. "Philip, Sarah, Lucy, Brian...everything happened so fast."

"I know," Howard's voice was deep and gentle, his gray eyes reflecting the city lights dancing on the water. "But what matters is that we're all safe now. Lucy is recovering, and Brian is starting to accept this new family."
I nodded gratefully, appreciating that Howard didn't mention the horrors of that night in the factory or what Philip had almost done to me.He focused only on the present, on keeping me and the children safe.
"Annie," Howard finally broke the brief silence, "there's something I want to discuss with you."
I turned to him. "What is it?"

Howard took a deep breath, his expression becoming both serious and tender. "These past few days, I've been thinking about our future. After

facing so much danger and pain. I've realized life is too short to waste on fear and hesitation."


He took my hand and kissed it softly. "I want to have a wedding, Annie.Not one of those grand Upper East Side social events, but a ceremony filled with love and joy, with only our closest people present. I want to formally announce to the world that you're my wife, and Lucy and Brian are our children."

I looked at him in surprise. "A wedding? Howard, are you sure this is the right time, considering everything we've just been through..."

Howard gently caressed my cheek. "It's precisely because we've been through all this that we should celebrate our love. Don't you think? We've allowed fear and pain to occupy too much of our time. It's time to begin anew."

He pulled me closer. "I want to give you a beautiful memory, Annie. One that can replace those nightmares. I want Lucy to witness our commitment,and Brian to know he'll always be part of this family. This isn't just a wedding-it's our new beginning together."

I felt my eyes grow moist, a surge of emotion rising within me. This man,once known as the "cold CEO" by Howard Technologies employees, now wanted to dispel the shadows in my heart with love and commitment.
"Will you, Annie?" Howard's eyes were full of expectation. "Will you put the past behind us and begin a new life with me?"
I looked at him tenderly, tears glistening in my eyes. "Yes,Howard.More than anything."
Howard's face lit up with a radiant smile as he reached into his suit pocket

and produced an elegant Tiffany blue velvet box. "I was saving this for a more perfect moment." He opened it to reveal a simple yet stunning diamond ring that sparkled in the light.

I held my breath as Howard carefully slipped the ring onto my finger. In that moment. I felt all my fears dissipating, replaced by hope and love.

"It's beautiful," I whispered. my voice trembling with emotion.

Howard kissed me softly. "No, you're the beautiful one, my fiancée."

Back in the bedroom, we stood in the center of the dimly lit room. Howard closed the door, and silence enveloped us. Only our breathing and the distant sound of waves filled the space. My fingers unconsciously touched the new ring, its cool metal reminding me this was all real.

Howard stood a few steps away, his gaze cautious and concerned.

"What are you afraid of?" I asked softly,stepping toward him.

"Hurting you," he answered simply, his eyes glancing at the bandages on my wrists.
I shook my head and rose on my tiptoes to kiss him. His hands hovered uncertainly in the air, hesitant to touch me. I took his wrists and firmly guided his hands to my waist.
"I don't want you to be careful tonight," I whispered between kisses."I need to feel you."
Howard's breathing grew heavier. His hands finally settled on my waist,the heat from his palms seeping through my silk nightgown making me shiver. I gently pushed against his chest until his legs hit the edge of the bed and he sat down.

Standing between his parted legs. I slowly unbuttoned my nightgown. In the dim light, my fingers moved across the fabric, one button after another coming undone.

Howard's Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed hard, his eyes following my every movement. The nightgown slipped to the floor with a soft rustle,leaving me naked before him, my skin prickling from both the cool air and his burning gaze.

When I straddled his thighs, I could feel his hardness straining against his pants. I deliberately rocked my hips, the friction of fabric making him draw a sharp breath. Howard's fingers finally dug into my hips.

I unbuttoned his shirt. working my way up, letting my fingertips linger in each newly exposed gap. When I pulled the shirt from his shoulders, his muscular upper body displayed perfect valleys and ridges of shadow and muscle in the soft light.I leaned down to trace his collarbone with my lips and tongue, then moved to his chest, my tongue flicking across his nipple,making his entire body tense.

"This is torture," he sighed, his voice husky with desire.

His belt slid slowly through my hands, the metal buckle hitting the floor with a distinct sound. The zipper coming down accompanied his constrained breathing. When my fingers slipped beneath the fabric and wrapped around his hardness, Howard's head fell back, a deep groan escaping from his throat.
I moved my hand up and down, feeling him pulse and throb in my palm.Howard's hands were no longer restrained, sliding from my waist to my breasts, his palms almost completely covering them. When his thumbs brushed across my already hardened nipples, an electric current of pleasure made me arch my back involuntarily.

Howard suddenly stood up, one hand supporting my backside,the other around my waist, lifting me onto the bed. He quickly removed his remaining clothes, standing naked at the foot of the bed. The light outlined every contour of his body, from broad shoulders to taut abdomen,to his erect manhood.


I licked my lips and sat up, preparing to lean forward, but Howard stopped me with one hand. The muscles on the inside of his thighs trembled with tension. He lowered himself onto me, his weight pinning me to the mattress as his tongue parted my lips, entering my mouth. His kiss was both dominating and tender, his tongue teasing mine, mimicking more intimate movements.

"I want to taste you," he whispered against my ear, his hot breath making my earlobe burn.

His lips left mine, trailing down my jawline, biting gently at my neck, then licking the hollow of my collarbone. His hands roamed my body,fingers threading through my hair, then along my neck, shoulders,finally cupping my breasts.Howard's mouth continued downward, his tongue circling my areola before suddenly taking the hardened peak between his lips,sucking gently. My fingers tangled in his dark hair, nails inadvertently scraping his scalp.

One of his hands slid lower, across my stomach, then my waist,finally reaching the inside of my thigh. His palm pressed against my skin, gently parting my legs, his fingers finding my already wet entrance. When his fingers entered me, I felt a sweet, sharp sensation. Howard skillfully curled his fingers, finding that spot that made me lose control.
His lips continued their downward journey, leaving a trail of moist kisses on my abdomen, then my hipbone, the inside of my thigh. When his



tongue finally reached my core, my legs trembled uncontrollably. His tongue moved skillfully around my sensitive areas,sometimes gentle.sometimes firm. When he combined his tongue with his fingers, pleasure crashed over me in waves.


Just as my climax approached, Howard suddenly stopped and rose up.I looked at him with longing in my eyes, his gaze now as dark as ink. He adjusted his position, his hardness pressing against my entrance. I reached down to guide him as he slowly entered. When he was fully inside,we both sighed with satisfaction.

"Are you okay?" Howard asked softly, his forehead already covered with fine beads of sweat.

I nodded.wanting not his question but his answer.

Howard began to move, starting with slow,exploratory thrusts,then gradually increasing his pace. One hand braced beside my head,the other supporting my hips,allowing each thrust to reach the deepest part of me.Sweat dripped from his forehead onto my chest. The bed creaked rhythmically with our movements,creating a harmonious symphony with our heavy breathing.

My legs wrapped around his waist, heels pressing into his back,urging him deeper. Howard's hand slid to where we were joined, his thumb finding the sensitive bud, stimulating it in rhythm with his thrusts.Pleasure built rapidly inside me, like a flood about to break through a dam.
My breathing became rapid, almost suffocating. When the climax washed over me, I gripped his back tightly, nails leaving marks on his skin.Howard seemed stimulated by my response, his movements becoming more forceful and urgent. After several deep thrusts, his entire body tensed as he released inside me.

Howard collapsed onto me, breathless, his weight giving me a satisfying feeling of being completely possessed. Our skin stuck together with sweat,heartbeats gradually returning to normal. He rolled to his side,pulling me into his arms, one hand gently stroking my back, the other brushing away strands of hair stuck to my face.


"The wedding." Howard murmured, "on the Long Island shore."

I nodded, nestling against his chest, feeling the rhythm of his heartbeat. I closed my eyes, a smile playing on my lips.

Lying in Howard's warm, strong embrace, feeling his heartbeat, thinking of golden-haired, blue-eyed Lucy and once-estranged Brian sleeping in nearby rooms. I had found my true belonging. This girl from a single-parent home in Boston who came to New York finally had a complete family.

###Chapter 265: Forever After

Annie's POV

The day had finally arrived. I woke up in the master bedroom of Howard's Long Island mansion, staring at the ceiling as I took a deep breath. A month had passed since that nightmarish kidnapping incident, and though the scars were still healing, we had decided to use this opportunity to begin anew.

The room was already filled with fresh flowers. Just as I sat up, there was a gentle knock at the door.

"Come in," I adjusted my robe and watched as Ruth, my mother, and Selena, Howard's sister, entered with faces beaming with joy. "My daughter is getting married!" Ruth embraced me with tears in her eyes. "From Boston to New York, you've been through so much. Now you're finally going to be happy."

Selena raised a champagne glass with her characteristic playful smile. "Ready to become Mrs. Thompson?" "More ready than I've ever been," I smiled, accepting the glass.

As we clinked glasses, Lucy burst in wearing her small white dress. "Mommy! Can I wear my flower girl dress now?" "Of course, sweetheart," I kissed her forehead, noticing Brian hesitating at the doorway. "Brian, come in," I beckoned to him. Brian entered, uncertainty still lingering in his eyes. "Mom... Annie, can I walk in front of you with Lucy?" "Nothing would make me happier," I replied softly.

The morning progressed with a sense of peace. As time passed, more guests arrived. Catherine Morgan and Susan Moore entered with champagne. "The untouchable CEO Howard Thompson conquered by a Boston girl!" Catherine laughed.

Susan handed me a blue box. Howard asked me to deliver this—your 'something blue.' I opened it to find an exquisite sapphire necklace with a note: "To my star, may you always shine. Love, Howard."

Time slipped away. By noon, I could see the wedding venue on the beach. Rows of white chairs were arranged neatly. As the music began, Lucy and Brian led the way, scattering flower petals. Finally, the wedding march played. Arm in arm with Ruth, I walked slowly toward Howard.

When I reached him, he took my hands. "You're breathtaking," he whispered. The minister began the ceremony. "Do you, Howard Thompson, take Annie Baker to be your lawfully wedded wife?" Howard's voice was unwavering. "I do." "And do you, Annie Baker, take Howard Thompson to be your lawfully wedded husband?" "I do," I replied.

As we exchanged rings, I noticed Howard's hands trembling slightly—this powerful CEO was overwhelmed with emotion. "I now pronounce you husband and wife," the minister announced. Howard gently lifted my veil and kissed me with such tenderness.

The reception that followed was intimate and joyful. As dusk fell, Howard rose to speak. "Annie, thank you for giving Lucy and me a true home." When it was my turn, I said: "With Howard's love, I've found where I truly belong."

Later that night, after the guests had left and the children were asleep, Howard and I stood on the terrace, watching the moonlight reflect on the ocean waves. He drew me into a warm embrace, his presence a steady anchor for my soul.

"Welcome home, Mrs. Thompson," he whispered against my temple. "I've been home all along," I replied, leaning my head against his chest, "because home is wherever you are."

In the quiet of the night, I felt a profound sense of peace. The nightmares of the past were gone, replaced by the promise of a shared future. I knew that whatever challenges might come, we would face them as one. I had finally found my place. Like the end of a fairy tale—we would indeed live happily ever after.
