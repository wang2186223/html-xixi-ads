###Chapter 1: Susan and Dogs Are Not Allowed

The wind howled bitterly.

Susan Thompson hunched over in front of the villa at Shallow Bay, the searing pain in her stomach making it hard to stand. She clenched her teeth and pounded desperately on the tightly shut door.

"Andrew, please... save Daniel! He really is your son!"

Snowflakes landed on her pale face, melting instantly into teardrops. Trembling, she raised her hand and slammed against the door again.

"Fifty thousand... just fifty thousand... Daniel's surgery can't wait any longer..."

A sharp stab of pain shot through her abdomen, and she staggered, bracing herself against the wall. The agony of late-stage stomach cancer felt like knives twisting inside her, but she ignored it.

"Andrew, I'll do anything..."

The door suddenly swung open.

A flicker of hope lit up Susan's dull eyes.

"Andrew..."

The butler stepped out expressionlessly, hung a brand-new wooden plaque on the door, then shut it firmly in her face.

The bright red words on the plaque burned into her vision.

"Susan and Dogs Are Not Allowed."

Susan suddenly laughed, the sound hollow and broken in the freezing wind. In Andrew Lucas' eyes, she was worth less than a dog.

That misunderstanding four years ago had destroyed her life. Andrew believed she had abandoned him to chase wealth, aborted their child, and even hired someone to break his leg.

The truth didn't matter anymore.

He would never believe her.

The icy wind drove snowflakes into her thin collar. Instinctively, she tried to pull her coat tighter with her left hand, only to be met with excruciating pain. That arm had been ruined during Nicole Capra's imprisonment.

Three days later, Susan finally saw Andrew again.

Their marriage was a joke. He had arranged for her to live in a place called "Willow Lane," as if to remind her of her status.

Now, Andrew stared coldly at her kneeling form.

"Nicole..."

When it was over, he shoved her away without hesitation, straightening his suit sleeves with slow precision.

"You're not Nicole." His voice was glacial. "Get out."

A violent cramp twisted her stomach, but the pain in her heart was worse.

He had mistaken her for Nicole again.

The boy who once cherished her now only touched her when he imagined she was someone else.

"Andrew..." Susan crawled weakly toward him. "Can we just—"

Before she could finish, a cold hand closed around her throat.

A sharp crack—

The air was cut off instantly.
###Chapter 2: Shattered Dignity

"You dare slander Nicole, Susan?" Andrew Lucas's fingers dug into my chin. "If she hadn't sold her kidney to save me four years ago in that car accident, I'd be a cripple by now!"

Tears welled up in my eyes from the pain. "Andrew, I didn't—"

"Shut up!" He shoved me away violently. "While you were rolling in bed with Henry, she was raising money for me!"

I staggered back two steps, my spine hitting the cold wall.

A sharp pain suddenly shot through my abdomen. I pressed my hand against it desperately. Daniel was still waiting for me at the hospital. I had to hold on.

"Andrew, Daniel's condition is worsening..." My voice trembled as I reached out. "Could you lend me five hundred thousand?"

Andrew suddenly laughed. That smile was like a poisoned blade, slicing my heart to pieces.

He pulled out two bills and threw them in my face. "A hundred per round. Generous enough, don't you think?"

The sharp edges of the money cut my cheek. I bent down to pick up the two hundred dollars, my fingers shaking uncontrollably.

"It's not enough..." My voice came out hoarse. "The girls at 'A Variety of Beauties' charge a thousand per session. We did it twice..."

Andrew's eyes turned to ice.

He grabbed a stack of cash and hurled it at me. The bills fluttered down like snowflakes.

"Susan, you're rotten to the core!"

The door slammed shut with a deafening crash. On my knees, I gathered the scattered bills one by one.

Two thousand dollars. Enough for Daniel's blood transfusion.

A faint sound came from the hallway. I yanked the door open in panic—

Daniel's small figure stood at the stairwell, staring at the direction Andrew had left. A piece of paper was clutched tightly in his hand, his lips moving soundlessly.

He was calling for "Daddy."

When he saw me, he quickly hid the paper behind his back and forced a smile. "Mommy."

My heart split in two.

"Daniel, Mommy is so sorry..."

"I only need Mommy." He threw himself into my arms, pressing his face against my chest. "Mommy is the best in the world."

Before the words fully left his mouth, his body suddenly stiffened—then went limp as he collapsed.

"Daniel!"
###Chapter 3: Andrew, I'm No Longer Your Only One

The moment the paper fluttered down, Susan Thompson saw the scribbles clearly.

A family of three.

Little Daniel had written "My Hero" in crooked letters, next to a drawing of a tall man.

Her heart felt like it was being sliced by a blunt knife. Her Daniel had always longed for a father's love.

"Mommy, don't cry." Daniel weakly lifted his hand to wipe her tears, his face as pale as paper.

By the time the ambulance arrived, Susan's fingers were trembling. The doctors had said Daniel wouldn't live past five. And she had just taught him how to write the word "Daddy."

"Hold on, sweetheart. Mommy's taking you to the hospital."

When the red sports car barreled through the intersection, Susan even caught the cold smirk on Nicole Capra's lips. In the deafening crash, she shielded her child with her body.

"Rh-negative blood supply is running low!"

The nurse's shout pierced the silence of the emergency room hallway. Susan leaned against the wall, her vision blurring.

"Save Miss Capra first." Andrew Lucas's voice was icy. "That bastard doesn't deserve it."

Susan looked up sharply, meeting his bloodshot eyes. His suit was stained with blood—but none of it was Daniel's.

"Andrew, Daniel will die..."

"He deserves it." Andrew gripped her chin. "When you hit Nicole, did you ever think about the life inside her?"

The words struck like a hammer. Susan suddenly remembered her eighteenth birthday, when the boy had whispered under the fireworks, "Susan, you're my only one."

Promises really did expire.

"Backup blood bags have arrived!" A nurse rushed over. "But there's only enough for one patient..."

"Give it to Nicole." Andrew's tone was final. "As for that bastard—"

"He's your son!" Susan screamed. "Andrew Lucas, Daniel is your flesh and blood!"

The hallway fell dead silent. Andrew's expression froze, as if he'd just heard the most absurd joke in the world.

"Susan, your habit of lying needs to be fixed." He slowly released her, his eyes frosty. "Four years ago, you admitted that the man you slept with was a gigolo."

The heart monitor's shrill alarm suddenly blared.
###Chapter 4 He Thinks It's Dirty!

The hospital corridor was icy cold, the sharp scent of disinfectant stinging the nostrils.

Susan Thompson clutched the lab report so tightly her knuckles turned white.

Andrew Lucas stood before her, his tall frame casting a long shadow that engulfed her completely.

"Andrew, Daniel is really your son!" Susan's voice trembled. "I swear, you're the only man I've ever—"

"Enough!" Andrew suddenly raised his hand, tearing the report to shreds.

Pieces of paper fluttered down like snowflakes.

He looked down at her with frost in his eyes. "Susan, you disgust me."

Her entire body shuddered.

"Three years ago I saw you in bed with Henry myself." His lips curled in a sneer. "Stop pretending to be some virtuous saint now."

"That was Nicole's scheme!" Susan grabbed his sleeve desperately. "Andrew, please believe me just this once—"

"Let go." Andrew shook her off as if discarding something filthy. "Don't touch me."

Susan staggered back, her spine hitting the cold wall.

The emergency room light still glowed.

Her Daniel.

Just three and a half years old, now lying on that operating table fighting for his life.

"Mr. Lucas." A doctor approached hurriedly. "The blood bank is critically low. We can only save one."

Andrew didn't even blink. "Give it to Nicole."

"No!" Susan lunged at the doctor like a madwoman. "That's Daniel's blood! You can't—"

Two bodyguards immediately restrained her.

"Andrew!" Susan screamed, struggling wildly. "Nicole was faking it! She was smiling after she hit us with her car! She's trying to kill Daniel!"

Andrew turned to leave.

"Andrew Lucas!" Susan's voice rose sharply. "You're Rh-negative too! You can save Daniel!"

The man paused.

Hope flared in Susan's eyes.

But he only turned his head slightly, lips twisting into a cruel smile. "That bastard? I think it's dirty."

The words stabbed into Susan's heart like a knife.

She collapsed to the floor, watching Andrew's retreating back disappear down the corridor.

Memories flooded back.

That night four years ago when he'd held her close, his voice dripping with tenderness: "Susan, let's have a baby."

"I want our child to be the second happiest person in the world."

"Why not the first?" she'd asked, blushing.

He'd kissed her earlobe and chuckled. "Because the happiest will always be my Susan."

Tears splattered on the linoleum.

Susan wiped her face and suddenly noticed blood on her sleeve.

Daniel's blood.

She scrambled to her feet and rushed toward the blood collection room.

"Take my blood!" She yanked up her sleeve. "I'm the same blood type as Daniel!"

A nurse stopped her in alarm. "Ma'am, you just survived a car accident. You can't—"

"My son is dying!" Susan shrieked hysterically. "Drain me dry if you have to!"

The emergency light suddenly went dark.

Susan's blood turned to ice.

The doctor emerged, removing his mask. "I'm sorry... we did everything we could..."
###Chapter 5 He Personally Crushed All Hope!

She also had Rh-negative blood.

She could save Daniel!

Though late-stage stomach cancer compromised blood quality, cancer cells couldn't transmit through transfusion. After special treatment, her blood could safely sustain Daniel.

The cost? This transfusion would accelerate her death.

A faint smile touched Susan Thompson's pale lips. She'd willingly die this instant if it meant saving Daniel.

Watching crimson blood flow into the collection bag, Susan felt profound satisfaction. Her Daniel would live!

The timely transfusion pulled Daniel from death's door.

But Susan, already at death's threshold, collapsed into a coma after donating 1000 milliliters.

Three days passed before she stirred.

Through the haze, she sensed someone clutching her hand, tenderly calling her name.

That voice held the same warmth from their first meeting, laced with heartbreaking tenderness - as if years of pain and misunderstandings never existed.

Susan struggled to open her eyes, longing to see that beloved face.

Instead, Nicole Capra's sinister grin filled her vision.

The tenderness had been a dying hallucination.

Their twisted history spanned ten years.

Nicole, once an orphan adopted by the Thompsons, had miraculously become the long-lost Capra heiress three years prior.

This same Nicole had kidnapped Grandma Thompson four years ago, forcing Susan to leave Andrew Lucas.

After Susan complied, Nicole still murdered the old woman and imprisoned Susan in a lightless dungeon.

"Why are you here?" Susan's voice turned glacial.

"To share wonderful news!" Nicole's beautiful face twisted grotesquely. "Susan, you're pregnant."

"What?" Susan's trembling hand flew to her abdomen. Doctors had said conception was nearly impossible.

This miracle life meant new hope - and Daniel's cure! Stem cells from the baby's umbilical cord could permanently treat his thalassemia!

As hope flickered across Susan's face, Nicole hissed:

"Too bad Andrew already ordered the abortion!"

"Liar!" Susan's fingers dug into her belly.

"That bastard fetus is dead! And that sickly Daniel Almond will follow soon!"

"I demand to see Andrew!"

Nicole shoved Susan back, grinning wildly. "Know why he terminated it?"

She leaned close, savoring each word: "Because when my baby died, I grieved. So Andrew made your child die with mine!"

Nicole remembered Andrew's fleeting anguish when doctors announced the abortion - an emotion never shown during her fake pregnancy and miscarriage.

"One more thing," Nicole's voice turned saccharine. "Late-stage stomach cancer hurts, doesn't it? Want to know how long you have left?"
###Chapter 6: The Countdown of Life

"Thirty days!"

"Susan, the doctor says you have thirty days left to live at most. With that broken body of yours, how do you plan to fight me?"

Thirty days?

The late-stage stomach cancer diagnosis had already prepared Susan for death, but this number still stabbed her heart like a sharp knife. During her last checkup, the doctor had said she had six months. She never expected the disease to progress so rapidly.

Nicole Capra watched Susan's pale face with satisfaction, her lips curling into a smirk.

"That bastard in your belly is already over three months old. The fetus has formed—it even has a heartbeat." Nicole leaned in closer. "How painful do you think it would be to crush it alive with forceps?"

"Oh, and it was a short-lived little girl. Too bad I fed her to the dogs." Nicole laughed, her body shaking with amusement. "Daniel Almond was already sickly and doomed to die young. Who knew your daughter would go even sooner? Andrew Lucas personally killed both your children!"

Fed to the dogs?!

Susan's blood turned to ice.

With strength she didn’t know she had, she lunged from the hospital bed and slapped Nicole hard across the face. Before Nicole could react, Susan grabbed her hair and slammed her head against the wall with a sickening thud.

"Susan, you're insane!" Nicole shrieked, struggling, but she was no match for Susan’s sudden surge of fury.

"You killed my daughter!" Susan’s eyes burned red as she pinned Nicole to the ground, raining down blows. "You destroyed Daniel’s only hope!"

Blood pooled on the floor. Susan yanked Nicole’s hair so hard that a chunk tore out. She wanted to tear this vile woman apart.

"Andrew, help me!"

Andrew Lucas burst through the door and shoved Susan away. "Susan! Have you lost your mind?!" He shielded Nicole in his arms, his gaze frigid.

Susan looked at the man she once loved, her heart twisting in agony. She remembered when she first got pregnant—how the usually cold and composed Andrew had held her, grinning like a fool. "Susan, we're going to have a daughter!"

"Why a daughter? It could be a son."

"No, it has to be a daughter." He kissed her hair. "Sons are ugly. I want a beautiful little princess just like you."

Now their little princess had come—only to be killed by her own father, her body desecrated...

Tears blurred Susan’s vision as she whispered, trembling, "Andrew... why did you kill our daughter?"
###Chapter 7: On Your Knees! Apologize to Nicole!

Andrew Lucas felt a sharp pain in his chest. But when he looked down at Nicole Capra's bruised face and remembered Susan Thompson's vicious act of attempted murder with her car, his heart turned to ice.

"Susan, you killed Nicole and my child, yet you still want to keep that bastard in your womb?"

Susan trembled violently. "She's our daughter! Your own flesh and blood!"

"A venomous woman like you doesn't deserve to bear my child!" Andrew's voice cut like a blade. "You disgust me."

Those words shattered Susan's heart into pieces.

So in his eyes, she wasn't even worthy of carrying his child.

"Andrew, it hurts..." Nicole whimpered weakly in his arms. "I just wanted to check on Susan..."

Andrew's gaze softened instantly, but froze again when he turned to Susan. "On your knees!"

"What?" Susan couldn't believe her ears.

"I said kneel! Apologize to Nicole!"

"I did nothing wrong!" Susan straightened her back defiantly.

Nicole suddenly tugged Andrew's sleeve. "Andrew, Susan just lost her baby. She's upset. I'm fine..."

"Susan," Andrew's voice turned glacial, "either you kneel, or I'll have Daniel thrown out of the hospital immediately."

Susan's nails dug deep into her palms.

Daniel's pale little face flashed before her eyes - that sweet boy who always smiled through his pain saying "Mommy, it doesn't hurt."

Her knees hit the floor with a thud.

Andrew's pupils contracted sharply.

She actually knelt!

For that bastard's child, she would truly do anything!

Nicole nearly failed to suppress her smirk, quickly forcing a look of distress. "Susan, get up..."

"She enjoys humiliating herself," Andrew sneered. "Might as well make her your free nurse."

From that day on, Susan became Nicole's personal servant.

"I want pork rib soup," Nicole ordered sweetly.

Susan endured her abdominal pain while working in the kitchen.

As she placed the steaming bowl on the table, Nicole suddenly grabbed it and poured the contents over her own hand.

"Andrew! She tried to scald me!" Nicole shrieked.

Susan froze for a second, then laughed coldly.

Since she'd be framed either way—

She picked up the remaining half bowl and flung it directly into Nicole's face.

"Enjoy playing the victim? Let me give you a real reason to cry!"
###Chapter 8: Truth and Bloodshed

"Ahhh—!"

Nicole Capra's scream shattered the silence of the hospital room. She clawed frantically at her burning face, leaving red streaks on her skin with her nails.

Slap!

The sharp sound of a palm striking flesh echoed through the room. Susan Thompson's head snapped to the side. Blood trickled from the corner of her lips, yet she curled them into a cold smile.

The man she had loved for so many years was nothing but a blind fool.

"My face!" Nicole's swollen features resembled a pig's head, her tears and snot smeared across her skin. "Andrew, I can't see! My eyes—they hurt so much!"

"Don't be afraid." Andrew Lucas carefully scooped Nicole into his arms. Before leaving, he shot Susan a venomous glare. "If anything happens to Nicole, I'll make sure you suffer worse than death."

Susan watched them leave, her hand drifting to her flat stomach. The baby was gone. Daniel had no hope left. She was already in hell—what more did she have to fear?

Nicole's injuries weren't life-threatening, but the burns and bruises made her look pitiful.

Catherine Capra rushed to the hospital as soon as she heard the news. Just as she reached for the door, voices from inside made her freeze.

"Nicole, my darling, how dare that bitch do this to you!" Sophia Capra sobbed, clutching Nicole's hand.

"Don't worry, Mom." Nicole's voice dripped with venom. "That dying wretch Susan won't live past this month."

Catherine's hand hovered mid-air. She couldn't believe what she was hearing.

"Once that bitch is dead, no one will ever know the truth." Sophia's tone was laced with malicious glee.

Thud. The sound of a handbag hitting the floor startled the occupants inside.

Catherine pushed the door open with trembling hands. "What... did you just say?"

Nicole's face paled before twisting into a grotesque smile. "Mom, what are you talking about?"

"Susan is my real daughter, isn't she?" Catherine demanded sharply.

Nicole slowly climbed out of bed, advancing step by step. "Mom, how could you doubt your own flesh and blood?"

Catherine turned to flee but found the door locked behind her by Sophia.

"Help—!" Her cry was cut short as Nicole grabbed her hair and slammed her head into the wall.

Blood gushed from Catherine's temple. Nicole pulled out a gleaming fruit knife and whispered in her ear, "Remember—Susan is the one who killed you."

The dull thud of the blade piercing flesh was deafening in the silent room. Once. Twice. Three times... Crimson splattered across the pristine white walls.
###Chapter 9: Bloodstained Trap

Nicole Capra's rough palm clamped over Catherine Capra's mouth and nose, her nails digging into the pale skin.

Catherine's lashes fluttered violently, like a dying butterfly. Her slender fingers clawed uselessly at the air before going limp.

Nicole held the fruit knife steady. The blade glinted coldly under the sunlight. With practiced precision, she stabbed Catherine's abdomen—once, twice, three times.

"Mom, she's not moving anymore." Nicole's voice was eerily calm. "Now it's Susan Thompson's turn."

Susan was packing up Daniel's toys in the hospital room when a sudden chill ran down her spine. The plastic car slipped from her fingers, clattering to the floor.

Her phone lit up with the caller ID: "Mom."

"Susan, I've had a change of heart." Grandma Thompson's voice dripped with unnatural enthusiasm. "Your father and I sold the old house. The money's ready. Come to Nicole's room to get the bank card."

Susan's fingers trembled slightly. She desperately needed that money—Daniel's transplant couldn't wait any longer.

The moment she pushed open the door, the metallic tang of blood assaulted her senses. Susan's pupils constricted—

Catherine lay sprawled in a pool of blood, a fruit knife buried in her chest. Her hospital gown was soaked crimson.

"Mom! What happened?" Susan's voice cracked.

Grandma Thompson suddenly seized her from behind, her rough hands like iron shackles around Susan's wrists.

"Andrew! Get up here now!" Nicole shrieked into her phone. "Susan's gone mad! She's trying to kill me!"

Susan struggled violently but couldn't break free. Blood smeared across her white coat like blooming red plum blossoms.

The door burst open. The second Victor Thompson charged in, Nicole collapsed to the floor, sobbing hysterically.

"Dad... Susan murdered Catherine... Mom tried to protect me..." She gasped between wails. "It's all my fault... I couldn't stop her..."

Victor's eyes burned with fury. He grabbed Susan by the throat and slammed her against the wall.

"Why?" His voice was pure venom. "Catherine was always kind to you!"

Susan's vision blurred. As darkness swallowed her, she saw Andrew Lucas standing in the doorway—his eyes colder than she'd ever seen.
###Chapter 10: Pushing Her into the Abyss

Victor Thompson's hand clamped around Susan Thompson's throat like an iron vise.

Her vision darkened at the edges.

A deafening buzz filled her ears.

"It was... Nicole..." Susan gasped, clawing desperately at Victor's hand, leaving bloody streaks on his skin.

"Shut up!" Victor's eyes burned crimson. "Nicole is my daughter!"

Andrew Lucas burst into the room. "Uncle Victor! Catherine's still breathing!"

Victor released Susan instantly, scooping Catherine Capra into his arms as he rushed out.

Nicole Capra exchanged a knowing glance with her mother.

Susan collapsed to the floor, coughing violently, her throat raw and burning.

Andrew yanked her up by the collar. "Why did you hurt Catherine?"

"It wasn't me!" Susan's voice was hoarse. "Nicole did it—"

Nicole suddenly clung to Andrew's sleeve, tears streaming down her face. "Andrew, this is all my fault..."

Her delicate shoulders trembled with sobs.

Then, to Susan's shock, her own mother dropped to her knees. "Mr. Lucas, please spare Susan!"

"Mom?" Susan stared in disbelief.

"She just... lost her way for a moment," her mother wept. "She resents Nicole for taking you from her..."

Andrew's lips curled into a cold smile. "Anything else to say, Susan?"

Susan's gaze locked onto her mother. "Why...?"

"I'm doing this for your own good!" her mother cried, shaking her head in despair.

Andrew shoved Susan away. "Rot in prison."

Three days later, Susan was escorted into Greenhill Penitentiary.

The iron gate slammed shut behind her.

That very night, she was pinned to the cold concrete floor and beaten mercilessly.

"Heard you pissed off Mr. Lucas?" a female inmate sneered, yanking her hair.

Susan curled into a corner, blood trickling from her split lip.

She thought of Daniel in the hospital.

"I can't die," she whispered through gritted teeth.

On the seventh day, Nicole appeared at the visitation window.

Dressed in an elegant Chanel suit, she smiled sweetly.

"Sister, I came to share some good news."
###Chapter 11: Severing Her Last Hope

Susan Thompson curled up on the cold concrete floor, blood seeping through her torn clothes, spreading into a dark crimson pool beneath her. The sharp click of high heels echoed, growing louder with each step.

Nicole Capra stood before her in limited-edition red-soled shoes, tilting Susan's chin up with the tip of her stiletto. "Well, well, if it isn't the high-and-mighty Miss Thompson?" Her laughter was sickly sweet. "Andrew specifically asked me to... take good care of you."

Susan's lashes trembled. Him again.

"Don't believe me?" Nicole pulled a scalpel from her clutch, its blade glinting coldly under the light. "He said these hands of yours touched what they shouldn't have. They need to be... dealt with."

Susan jerked her head up, meeting Nicole's mocking gaze. "You're lying!" Her voice was hoarse. "Andrew would never—"

"Never what?" Nicole leaned down, dragging the blade across Susan's wrist. A thin red line appeared instantly. "Never send you to prison? Never have your ribs broken?" She pressed harder. "Susan, wake up. The dream's over."

Two black-suited bodyguards pinned Susan's shoulders, crushing her against the floor. Nicole raised the scalpel, its gleam reflecting her twisted smile. "Don't worry, I'm skilled. Ever heard of an ancient punishment called 'human swine'? We'll take it slow..."

"Enough."

The icy command froze everyone in place. Andrew Lucas stood at the doorway, his tailored suit sharp as knives, his gaze colder.

Nicole's eyes welled up instantly. "Andrew, I just—I couldn't bear it. What she did to Mother—"

"I know." He took the scalpel from her, running his thumb along the blade. "This isn't for your hands to dirty."

He crouched, meeting Susan at eye level. The same hands that once shielded her from storms now gripped her wrist. "Susan," he murmured, "what gave you the right to lay a finger on Nicole's mother?"

Susan stared into the frost in his eyes and suddenly laughed. "Andrew Lucas, are you really going to destroy my last chance to play piano?" She lifted her mangled right hand. "These fingers played 'A Wedding in Dreams' for you 999 times."

Andrew's gaze darkened, but the blade pressed against her knuckles. "The moment you killed Grandma, you lost the right to speak of the past."

As agony tore through her, Susan's vision blurred. For a heartbeat, she saw eighteen-year-old Andrew—the boy who once cradled her hands, whispering, "Susan's hands create miracles. I'll treasure them forever."

The warmth of memory clashed with the cold reality. At last, she broke into wrenching sobs.
###Chapter 12 The Divorce Papers

The blade glinted in the dim light as Susan Thompson closed her eyes. She was exhausted, too drained to even struggle.

In her daze, she heard someone screaming her name in agony.

First "Susan," then it morphed into "Susie."

The voice sounded eerily familiar—cold yet tender, like the boy from her memories. She knew it was just a hallucination. Her Andrew had vanished long ago, along with her shattered heart.

When she opened her eyes again, sunlight streamed through the curtains. She found herself lying in bed at Willow Lane Apartments, her hands unharmed.

A tall figure stood by the window.

"Andrew?"

Andrew Lucas turned. The sunlight cast shadows across his sharp features, and for a fleeting moment, Susan thought she saw a flicker of pain in his eyes.

But it was gone in an instant.

"Awake?" His lips curled into a sneer. "Tired of playing dead?"

Before she could speak, his icy voice cut through the air. "Sign it. The divorce."

Those words stabbed her heart like a knife. Even knowing their marriage had always been about revenge, the pain still made her tremble.

"You said..." Her voice shook. "You said it would be till death..."

"A toy I'm done with," Andrew mocked, his lips twisting. "Why keep it around to disgust myself?"

Susan clenched the sheets. There were so many things she wanted to say, but his words left her speechless.

"I won't sign." She stubbornly shook her head.

A stack of papers hit her face. The bold words "Divorce Agreement" burned her eyes.

She knew he was in a hurry to marry Nicole Capra. But she refused to give that woman what she wanted.

"Not unless I'm dead!" Susan flung the papers to the floor.

Andrew's eyes darkened. He grabbed her wrist with bruising force, making her wince.

"A million dollars?" He scoffed. "Still thinking about that bastard?"

A pen was shoved into her hand.

"He won't live past today." Andrew forced her to sign the papers. "And you? You leave with nothing."
###Chapter 13: Andrew, My Death Would Be a Blessing

"I won't sign this!" Susan Thompson clutched the pen so tightly her knuckles turned white. "Andrew, unless you give me a million dollars, I refuse to sign!"

She had to hold onto her identity as Mrs. Lucas. It was the last chance she could secure for Daniel.

Andrew Lucas smirked and effortlessly pried her fingers open. He guided her hand, forcing her to write her name stroke by stroke on the divorce papers.

When he pressed her thumb onto the inkpad and stamped it onto the document, Susan felt as if her heart had been imprinted alongside it.

Andrew tucked both copies into a folder. Susan collapsed onto the edge of the bed, her body limp as if all her bones had been removed.

She had loved this man for half her life. Even after enduring his cruelty, that love had never wavered.

She once imagined her tombstone would read "Beloved Wife of Andrew Lucas." Now, they were nothing to each other.

No reunion in life, no remembrance in death.

Tears blurred her vision as she lifted her face, her voice trembling. "Andrew, please lend me a million dollars... I know you hate me, I know you wish I were dead..."

"I have stomach cancer. Late stage. Your wish will come true soon... Just please, save Daniel..."

"Cancer?" Andrew's brow furrowed. The word "dead" stabbed into his heart like a knife.

He studied the woman before him—her pallid face, disheveled clothes, her body worn to a shadow.

But the next second, he scoffed. "Nice act. Susan, what kind of terminal illness could possibly afflict someone like you?"

"Death would suit you." His lips curled into a cold smile, his eyes glacial. "That bastard can keep you company on your way to hell."

The door slammed shut behind him. Susan curled up on the floor, shaking from the pain.

So this was what her lifelong devotion had earned her—a single phrase: "Death would suit you."

This agony cut deeper than any physical wound.

Her phone rang abruptly. An unknown number.

The caller claimed to be a director, offering her the lead role in a music video for a hundred thousand dollars.

Susan knew how dark the entertainment industry could be. But the director assured her other crew members would be present.

She swallowed a painkiller, changed into a high-necked long-sleeved dress to hide her bruises, and rushed to the hotel.

The moment she reached the door, a greasy hand yanked her inside.
###Chapter 14: Don't Touch Me!

Susan Thompson remembered how gentle Director Cyrus had been during their first meeting, patiently guiding her positioning and praising her natural talent.

She never imagined he'd spike her drink at tonight's wrap party.

Her teeth clamped down on her tongue to stay conscious. Nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

"Director, control yourself!"

"Playing hard to get?" His greasy fingers gripped her chin. "Everyone knows Andrew Lucas dumped you. Be nice, and I'll give you the female lead in my next project."

Susan drove her knee upward.

The director anticipated the move, slamming her against the wall. Silk fabric ripped. Cold plaster pressed into her bare back.

"Let go!"

"I hear your mother's hospital bills are piling up." His whiskey breath scalded her ear. "Make me happy, and I'll cover everything."

A knife twisted in her stomach. Darkness edged her vision.

Her fingers brushed the doorknob before he yanked her hair, sending her sprawling. Hundred-dollar bills rained onto her face.

"Now you develop morals?"

The door exploded inward.

Andrew Lucas stood silhouetted in the doorway, his black trench coat swirling with winter air.

Director Cyrus fumbled with his belt buckle, stuffing cash down Susan's dress. "Great performance, sweetheart. Same time tomorrow."

Andrew's fist sent the director crashing into a champagne tower.

"Mr. Lucas!" The director scrambled backward, clutching his nose. "She wanted this! I have the transfer rec—"

A steel-toed boot cut him off mid-sentence. The director fled, but not before shooting Susan a conspiratorial wink.

Andrew ground a bill beneath his shoe, eyes glacial. "Two thousand per night? Your rates have improved."

Susan curled around the fire in her abdomen, sweat plastering hair to her face. The pain stole her voice.

"Desperate enough to whore yourself?" His tie slithered loose as he gripped her throat. "Let me inspect the merchandise."
###Chapter 15: He Pushed Her Into the Abyss

Andrew Lucas dragged Susan Thompson into the private room of A Variety of Beauties with brutal force. A searing pain tore through her stomach.

Three potbellied middle-aged men sat inside, their greasy eyes raking over Susan like wolves eyeing fresh prey.

"Mr. Lucas, who is this?" the heaviest man asked, rubbing his hands together.

Andrew smirked coldly and shoved Susan forward. "She’ll keep you company for drinks."

Susan staggered but steadied herself, then turned to leave.

"Stop." Andrew's voice was icy. "Take one step out that door, and tomorrow you'll be collecting Daniel's corpse."

The words stabbed straight into her heart. She froze, then mechanically took a seat on the sofa.

Glass after glass of liquor burned down her throat, scalding her already ravaged stomach. She clenched her teeth and forced herself to swallow.

"Mr. Lucas, this lady is absolutely stunning!" Mr. Li's hand slid onto Susan's shoulder with inappropriate familiarity.

Andrew swirled his glass, his gaze dark. "Have your fun. Don’t hold back."

Susan dug her nails into her palms. She looked up at Andrew—the face she once dreamed of now twisted into something unrecognizable.

"Darling~" Susan suddenly giggled, taking Mr. Li's hand. "It's too noisy here. Why don’t we go somewhere else?"

The shattering of glass cut through the air. Andrew had crushed his wineglass in his grip, blood dripping between his fingers.

Mr. Li, already enchanted, eagerly pulled Susan closer. "Sweetheart, I'll give you anything you want!"

As his greasy lips neared hers, Susan closed her eyes.

In that moment, she finally understood—the boy who once shielded her from the rain had died in that storm four years ago.
###Chapter 16 Doctor, Who Did You Say Has Terminal Cancer?

"Crash—"

Shards of glass exploded as the wine bottle in Andrew Lucas's hand shattered against Mr. Ferber's skull. Blood snaked down the man's greasy face, glistening eerily under the lights.

The private room fell deathly silent.

Susan Thompson curled into the sofa corner, her stomach churning violently. She bit her lip hard, nails digging into her palms to keep from vomiting.

"Mr. Lucas, what are you—" someone dared to speak.

Andrew didn't even glance their way. He yanked Susan up and dragged her out. She stumbled behind him like a ragdoll.

The sports car tore through the night.

Susan clutched her stomach, sweat soaking her back. Warm liquid rose in her throat—she forced it back down.

In the Willow Lane bedroom, Andrew threw her onto the bed.

"Andy..." Her trembling fingers reached for the pill bottle on the nightstand. "Please—"

He slapped the painkillers from her hand.

"Morning-after pills?" Andrew sneered. "That eager?"

"No..." Her vision blurred with pain. "Pain medication..."

"Stop lying!" He gripped her chin. "You seemed to enjoy yourself with Mr. Ferber."

Neon lights flickered outside. Susan's mind drifted to a winter night four years ago—a boy handing her hot cocoa, whispering, "Susan, someday we'll have our own light among all these."

The lights remained. Their home didn't.

"Tell me!" Andrew pinned her against the wall. "How many men have you been with?"

"Only you..." Her voice was a thread.

"Liar!" He ripped her collar open.

Amidst the agony, fabric tore. Susan gasped like a beached fish, unable to draw air.

Afterwards, she collapsed, vomiting blood-streaked bile.

"Disgusting." Andrew recoiled.

Susan curled into herself. "I'm sick..."

"Sick?" He laughed coldly. "You mean addicted to men?"

He dragged her by the hair toward the sofa. Darkness swallowed Susan's vision as she coughed up blood.

"Susan!"

Andrew's voice cracked. Lifting her frighteningly light body, he realized she'd wasted to bones.

The ER lights glared.

"Drinking with terminal stomach cancer?" The doctor removed his mask. "Prepare for the end."

Andrew stood frozen, thunderstruck. "Who... did you say?"
###Chapter 17: Susan, You're Not Allowed to Die!

The doctor adjusted his glasses, eyeing the well-dressed man suspiciously. "You didn't know the patient has terminal stomach cancer? Are you really her family?"

Andrew's fingers dug into his palms. His Adam's apple bobbed.

"Refusing medication despite such pain!" The doctor frowned disapprovingly. "This is playing with her life!"

Andrew's pupils constricted. He knew exactly why Susan avoided medicine—he'd personally thrown her pills out the window.

The memory of Susan desperately reaching out the window suddenly stabbed his nerves. He pressed a hand to his chest, but the searing pain wouldn't subside.

"Who are you to her? If you're not family, notify her relatives immediately. She doesn't have much time left."

"She won't die!" Andrew's sudden outburst made the doctor recoil. His bloodshot eyes were terrifying. "I forbid it! No one takes her away!"

The doctor gathered courage. "Sir, be realistic. In her condition, she has maybe a week—"

Before she finished, Andrew's explosive rage sent her scrambling to her office. One more second and she feared he'd snap her neck.

"Andrew, why do brides wear veils?"
"To grow old together."
"Andrew, when we marry, I'll wear a veil too—be your most beautiful bride."

Susan's smiling memory burned his eyes. She promised to grow old with him. How could she break that promise?

When Susan was wheeled out of emergency, Andrew crushed her to his chest. "Just stay alive, Susan. I'll forget everything."

Waking to Andrew's red-rimmed eyes, Susan thought she dreamed.

"Andrew?" Her weak smile trembled. "I'm dreaming of you again..."

"Not a dream." He gripped her hand, voice rough. "I'm here, Susan."

Feeling his warmth, Susan knew it was real. Before she spoke, Andrew's near-broken voice demanded, "Why didn't you tell me about the cancer?"

"I did..." she whispered. "You didn't believe me."

Andrew froze. He recalled his own words—"Good riddance!" Now each syllable carved his heart.

"You won't die." He buried his face in her neck. "We'll grow old together..."

Susan leaned into his embrace—warmth she'd never dared imagine.

"Andrew, Daniel is truly yours." She gathered courage. "Take the paternity test. Then you'll know I never lied."

Andrew's eyes darkened. Those vile images remained like thorns, yet he nodded. "Fine. I'll test."

Susan's eyes lit instantly. "Then...could you lend money for Daniel's surgery? He's fading..."

"Just stay alive." Andrew kissed her pale lips. "I'll give you anything."

The tender kiss shattered hearts. Remembering Nicole's pregnancy, Susan tasted bitterness. But with limited time left, having Andrew's company and Daniel's surgery chance was fortune enough.

Nicole's sudden high fever and coma interrupted their fragile peace. Andrew rushed to another hospital.

After five hours, Nicole stabilized. Andrew muttered reassurances before hurrying back. Outside Susan's room, he overheard a doctor's hallway call:

"Can you believe it? Faking illness is one thing, but terminal cancer? First time in my career!"
###Chapter 18: The Father's Love He Always Longed For

"Late-stage stomach cancer was fake?"

Andrew Lucas's hand hovered over the doorknob, his fingertips trembling slightly.

The doctor's voice continued in the hallway, "When that girl bit the blood pouch, I really thought she was dying. Young people these days—why are they so extreme in relationships?"

"What choice did I have? She held a scalpel to her own throat, threatening to kill herself if I didn't cooperate!"

Footsteps approached. The doctor turned and froze when he met Andrew's icy glare, his phone clattering to the floor.

"Who faked the illness?" Andrew's voice was laced with frost.

The doctor's lips trembled. "N-no one—"

Crack!

Andrew's strong fingers closed around the doctor's throat, slamming him against the wall. His eyes burned with fury, yet his voice was terrifyingly soft.

"Last chance."

The doctor's legs turned to jelly, his white coat soaked in sweat. "It was Susan! She paid me $10,000 and threatened to jump off a building! She wasn't sick—the blood was fake!"

Silence.

Andrew released him. The doctor collapsed, gasping for air. Staring at his own palm, Andrew suddenly let out a low, chilling laugh.

The temperature in the hallway seemed to drop.

"Susan... you're unbelievable."

Inside the VIP ward, Susan carefully folded the paternity test report. The words "Confirmed Biological Father" stood out in bold red.

She quietly pushed open the door to the adjacent room.

Daniel hurriedly shoved a piece of paper under his pillow, but Susan had already seen the crooked handwriting: How can I make Daddy like me?

"Sweetheart." She knelt beside the bed, unfolding the report. "Daddy never hated you."

Daniel's eyes lit up—then dimmed just as fast. "But he never lets me call him Daddy..."

"Because he didn't know you were his child." She placed the report in his small hands. "Now he does."

The three-year-old buried his face in the blanket, his voice muffled. "I don't care if he acknowledges me."

But his reddened ears betrayed him.

Susan gently rubbed his back. She knew how much this stubborn little boy yearned for a father's love.

The hallway lights stretched Andrew's shadow long and dark.

He stood outside the door, watching the tender scene inside, his expression growing colder.

When Susan returned to her own room, a dark figure suddenly pinned her against the wall. Cold fingers closed around her throat as a voice like the devil's whispered in her ear:

"Enjoying your performance, cancer patient?"
###Chapter 19: Susan, You Don't Deserve It!

"Andrew!"

Susan's throat was brutally squeezed, cutting off her breath instantly. Her eyes widened in disbelief at the man before her—the same Andrew Lucas who had treated her with tenderness just yesterday.

"Good acting." Andrew sneered, his eyes dark with fury. "Terminal stomach cancer? Susan, do you take me for a fool?"

"I didn't—"

"Shut up!" He released her abruptly, sending her crashing against the wall. His gaze raked over her like she was filth. "For that bastard, you'd even fake a terminal illness?"

Susan coughed violently, tears streaming uncontrollably. With trembling hands, she pulled a medical report from her bag. "Andrew, look! This is the hospital's diagnosis!"

He didn't even glance at it, slapping the papers from her grasp. The documents scattered across the floor as he stepped on them, crushing both the words and her dignity.

"Colluding with doctors for this charade? You've sunk lower than I thought."

"It's not a lie!" She grabbed his sleeve desperately. "Andrew, the doctor said Daniel can have surgery next week. Please—"

"Please?" His fingers dug into her chin with bone-crushing force. "Where was this begging four years ago? When you threw our dead child's body in my face, why weren't you crying like this?"

Her entire body shook as tears blurred her vision. She groped for the paternity test on the floor. "Daniel is really your son—"

"Enough!" Andrew snatched the document and tore it to shreds before her eyes. The fragments fluttered down like snow as his voice turned glacial. "Forged trash isn't worth my time."

As he turned to leave, Susan lunged and clung to his leg. "For Daniel's sake—"

"Get off!" He kicked her away violently. "Don't disgust me with that bastard!"

The door slammed with thunderous force. Susan collapsed on the floor, every scrap of paper cutting like knives against her fingertips. She mechanically tried piecing them together, but the proof remained irreparably broken.

"Mommy."

The small voice made her jerk her head up. Daniel stood in the doorway, his frail body swimming in hospital pajamas, bruises peeking from beneath bandages. His obsidian eyes darkened as they took in the scattered paper.

"Daniel..."

"Don't cry." Limping forward, he wiped her tears with tiny hands. "I don't need Daddy."

Her tears fell harder. The three-year-old knelt, carefully gathering every fragment before clutching them tightly in his palm.

"I just need Mommy."

He looked up with a smile more heartbreaking than tears. Susan pulled him into her arms, feeling his small frame tremble.

"Mommy, will you die?" he suddenly asked.

She froze. Meeting his clear eyes—filled with fear no child should know—she heard herself lie. "No. I'll always be with you."

But when he fell asleep, the mirror showed her pale face streaked with blood. The truth could no longer be denied.
###Chapter 20: A Deadly Bargain

Susan's fingers trembled, nearly dropping her phone. She couldn't let Daniel find out about her critical condition.

"Daniel, come here." She knelt and pulled her son into her arms. "Did you hear what Mommy just said to Uncle?"

Daniel nodded, his dark eyes filled with worry.

"Silly boy." Susan tapped his nose lightly. "Mommy was just acting. You know how those pretty ladies on TV pretend to be pitiful, right?"

"Really?" The three-and-a-half-year-old looked up, his lashes fluttering.

"Of course!" She pinched his chubby cheek. "Lying makes people ugly. Mommy would never do that."

The hospital door suddenly swung open. Andrew Lucas strode in, his expression icy as he snatched his forgotten car keys. As he turned, his lips curled into a mocking smirk.

Susan lowered her gaze, then looked up again with a bright smile. But Daniel suddenly wriggled free and charged at Andrew like a little lion.

"Bad man!" The child sank his teeth into Andrew's wrist, drawing blood instantly.

"Daniel!" Susan rushed forward in panic.

Andrew jerked his arm violently, sending Daniel crashing to the floor. The bandage on the boy's wound bloomed crimson.

"Know your place." Andrew spat the words and left without a backward glance.

Susan's hands shook as she pressed the call button. Daniel was sweating from pain, yet he reached up to wipe her tears. "Don't cry, Mommy. It doesn't hurt."

The more understanding he was, the deeper Susan's heart ached. She swore silently—no matter what, she would secure the money for his surgery.

Meanwhile, Nicole Capra paced her hospital room, agitation tightening her chest. She had just received word—Catherine Capra, who had been comatose, was showing signs of waking.

"Don't hurt Susan." Those were Catherine's first words upon regaining consciousness.

Nicole's nails dug into her palms. She had to act before Catherine fully recovered.

The opportunity came unexpectedly. Victor Thompson stepped out temporarily, and the nurse was absent. Nicole approached the bed, her fingers hovering over the oxygen mask.

The blinking red light of the surveillance camera made her hesitate. Instead, she "tenderly" adjusted the mask's position.

"Mom, get better soon..." She fake-sobbed, then froze when she felt Catherine's fingers twitch.

A chill ran down Nicole's spine. She needed to move faster.

Back in her own room, she dialed Susan's number.

"Let's make a deal." Nicole's voice dripped with arrogant confidence. "One million dollars, plus access to the world's top medical specialists."

Silence stretched on the other end.

"Pull the plug on Catherine, and Daniel gets to live." She lowered her voice. "One or the other. Fair, don't you think?"
###Chapter 21: The Pain of Forgetting

"Nicole Capra, you're insane!" Susan Thompson abruptly ended the call, her fingertips trembling slightly.

Her chest heaved violently as she leaned against the wall and slowly slid to the floor. The phone screen still glowed, displaying Nicole's final threatening message.

Outside, rain pattered against the window. Susan gazed at Daniel, asleep in the hospital bed. His pale face still bore the exhaustion from treatment. She gently stroked his cheek, silent tears rolling down her face.

Catherine Capra. The name sent a tremor through Susan's heart.

She remembered that rainy day when she had curled up in a muddy corner of the schoolyard. Catherine had walked over with an umbrella, her expensive dress splattered with mud, yet she hadn't cared. When those warm hands lifted her up, Susan had felt cherished for the first time.

"Why...?" Susan clenched her fists. The hatred Nicole held for her own mother sent chills down her spine.

Her phone suddenly vibrated with a notification: Vincent King Officially Takes Over as Head of King Group Today.

Susan's pupils contracted. The man in the photo, dressed in a tailored suit, was unmistakably the same Vincent who had endured the darkness of that prison cell with her.

Memories flooded back. In the darkness, Vincent's weak voice still echoed in her ears: "Susan, once we get out, I promise I'll cure Daniel..."

By the time Susan rushed out of the hospital, the rain had stopped. The sunlight stung her eyes.

The King Group building buzzed with activity. Security stopped her at the lobby, forcing her to head for the underground garage. Her shadow stretched long across the cold concrete floor.

Every minute of waiting felt like torture. Then the elevator doors opened, and at last, the familiar figure appeared.

"Vincent!" Susan lunged forward, grabbing his arm. "It's me! Daniel, he—"

The man coldly shook her off, his brow furrowed. "Miss, please control yourself."

Susan froze. The look in Vincent's eyes was terrifyingly unfamiliar.

"Vincent~" A saccharine voice called from behind. Candy Wilson looped her arm through Vincent's, eyeing Susan with a challenge. "Who's this?"

"I don't know her." Vincent smiled down at Candy, his gaze so tender it hurt.

Susan's entire body went cold. The man who had once called her "Susan" was now using the same endearment for someone else.

"Vincent, look at me!" Her voice shook. "In that cell, you said—"

"Ah!" Candy suddenly shrieked, collapsing to the ground.

Vincent's expression darkened instantly as he pulled Candy protectively into his arms. "Susan, what did you do?"

"It wasn't me!" Susan pointed to the security camera in the corner. "Check the footage—"

"Apologize." Vincent's voice was ice.

Susan stared at him in disbelief. The face that had once smiled so gently at her was now filled with disgust.

"Vincent, my ankle hurts..." Candy whimpered against his shoulder.

Vincent's eyes turned stormy. Before Susan could react, a sharp pain shot through her knee—he had kicked her.

She staggered and fell to her knees. When she looked up, all she saw was Vincent walking away with Candy in his arms.

The rain had started again without her noticing, mixing with her tears and blurring her vision. Curled up on the cold ground, Susan suddenly remembered Vincent's words from long ago:

"Susan, even if the whole world betrays you, I'll stand by your side."

Turns out, even memories can betray you.
###Chapter 22: Andrew, We're Over

Vincent's kick came without warning.

Susan's knees slammed onto the hard ground.

The searing pain drained all color from her face.

"Don't be scared, Candy." Vincent cradled Candy Wilson protectively, his voice dripping with tenderness. "I promised no one would hurt you."

Candy... wait for me...

Susan's vision blurred as she recalled Vincent whispering those same words to her countless times in the dungeon.

The irony tasted bitter.

The two people who'd forced her to kneel—one was the man she loved, the other her sworn sister.

Those she cherished always crushed her dignity with their own hands.

The pain radiated from her knees to her stomach.

By the time she hauled herself up using the wall, the hallway stood empty.

Night swallowed the city as she wandered aimlessly, a hollow shell.

Neon lights flickered but couldn't pierce the darkness ahead.

A million dollars—a drop in the ocean for Daniel's treatment.

But she'd claw that money from fate itself if needed.

Three hours later, Susan returned to Willow Lane.

The apartment belonged to Andrew Lucas, but some of her belongings remained—maybe they could fetch some cash.

The living room lights stabbed her eyes when she opened the door.

Andrew sat on the couch, radiating dangerous energy.

"Finally decided to come back?" He stood with a冷笑, hurling photographs at her face. "You never cease to disgust me, Susan."

The photos scattered—misleading shots of her "embracing" Vincent in the garage, others capturing her humiliating fall.

"Andrew, these photos—"

"Explain this!" He seized her throat, fury blazing in his eyes. "You spread your legs for me yesterday, and today you're already hunting for your next man?"

The familiar suffocation almost made her laugh.

At this rate, he'd reshape her neck into a swan's.

"Vincent and I are清白." She pried his fingers loose, her voice eerily calm.

Andrew picked up a photo showing Vincent's foot mid-kick. "This is your version of清白?"

Suddenly, explanations felt pointless.

Her lips curved into a broken smile. "Andrew, we're divorced."

"Whether I seduce one man or ten—it's none of your business." She met his gaze squarely. "Mr. Lucas, remember—you're nothing to me now."

"Susan!" He slammed her onto the couch, his breath scalding her skin. "Even if I discard you, you don't get to run!"

She didn't resist, just closed her exhausted eyes. "I just came from another man's bed. Won't your OCD kick in, Mr. Lucas?"

Andrew recoiled as if burned, disgust flashing across his face. "You make me sick!"

The door crashed shut behind him.

Susan rolled off the couch, curling into a ball as stomach spasms wracked her body.

No painkillers—this agony might kill her.

Crawling toward the door, she suddenly found herself stuffed into a burlap sack by two black-clad men.

Engine roar. Darkness.

Damp, frigid air greeted her when consciousness returned.

This was... Henry's dungeon!

"Like Catherine Capra?" Candy's sweet voice came from behind.

Susan turned to see Candy cradling a bandaged arm, smiling.

"Nina said you should become just like her. Wouldn't that be perfect?"

Catherine's missing pinky finger...

The knife in Candy's hand sent ice slithering down Susan's spine.
###Chapter 23 The Agony of a Severed Finger

"No..."

Susan Thompson struggled desperately, but could only watch as the sharp blade approached her pinky finger. She feared pain, but feared losing that finger even more.

The iron door of the dungeon burst open. Vincent King strode in with a group of bodyguards. His black trench coat made him look especially sinister under the dim light.

"Vincent!" Candy Wilson immediately threw herself at him, tears streaming as she clutched his arm. "Please spare Susan! She just acted impulsively..."

Vincent gently wiped Candy's tears away, but his gaze turned icy when he looked at Susan. "I warned you. Anyone who hurts Candy will pay the price."

Susan looked up at the man who was once gentle as jade. His lips, just as Bella Quinn had described, bore the mark of deep loyalty. But now, Vincent's eyes held only cruelty.

"Vincent, I never touched Candy!" Susan's voice was hoarse. "I went straight home after leaving the garage tonight. How could I have hired someone to hurt her?"

"Susan..." Candy shook her head pitifully. "I know you didn't mean it..."

"Enough!" Susan snapped. "Candy, aren't you tired of acting?"

Vincent's expression darkened further. "The men confessed. You paid them to break Candy's hand." He gripped Susan's chin. "You deserve to die."

Candy suddenly dropped to her knees. "Vincent, please spare her life! Just... just cut off one of her fingers?"

Vincent frowned and helped her up. "Candy, you're too kind."

"Vincent!" Susan suddenly laughed. "You're truly blind! How can someone like Candy be called kind?"

"Silence!" Vincent roared. "Do it!"

Susan thrashed wildly, her eyes landing on a phone on the floor. She strained to reach it, fingers trembling as she dialed Andrew Lucas' number.

"Andrew, save me..."

Nicole Capra's smug voice came through the line. "Sis, Andrew's in the shower."

Susan's heart plummeted. She heard the bathroom door open, followed by Andrew's impatient voice. "Who is it?"

"It's your wife. She says she's dying..."

"Let her die!"

The phone crashed to the ground. Susan's entire body went cold, Andrew's words—"Let her die"—echoing in her ears.

When the pain came, she didn't even have time to scream. Her pinky finger was severed clean off, blood gushing out. But compared to the agony in her heart, this was nothing.

"It hurts..." Susan curled into a ball, her right hand clutching her chest. "Andrew, it hurts so much..."

She remembered how he used to come running at the slightest whimper of pain. Now she was dying from it, while he was tangled up with someone else.

Tears splashed onto the phone screen—the call was still connected. Nicole's moans of pleasure stabbed into Susan's heart like knives.

Vincent stared at the woman lying in a pool of blood, his chest tightening inexplicably. He turned away irritably. "Let's go."

"Miss Candy, what about the finger...?"

The last thing Susan saw was Candy's triumphant smile before darkness swallowed her whole.
###Chapter 24: Bloodstained Severed Finger

A sinister smile slowly curled at the corners of Candy Wilson's lips. She tilted her head, her gaze methodically scanning Susan Thompson's pale face. Her usually sweet features twisted into something grotesque.

The hatred came without reason.

Just like her hatred for Susan.

Susan had never harmed her. In fact, she had extended a helping hand during Candy's lowest moments. Yet the hatred festered. As a child, she despised Susan's breathtaking beauty. Now, she loathed the woman who haunted Vincent King's every thought—the real "Candy."

"Nicole's orders..."

Candy dragged out her words, her saccharine voice now dripping with icy malice. "Chop off her fingers and feed them to the dogs!"

The bodyguard beside her shuddered but bowed his head obediently. "As you wish, Miss Wilson."

"As for this woman..."

Candy cast a disgusted glance at the barely conscious Susan. "Throw her back where she came from."

Susan was dumped unceremoniously back at Willow Lane Apartments.

Unlike when she left, she now lay sprawled on the cold floor, drenched in blood. Candy's men had hastily bandaged her wounds, the gauze already seeping crimson.

But she felt no pain.

The agony in her stomach and the searing torment of her severed finger had made her black out the moment she left the dungeon.

When she woke again, it was dawn. If not for the throbbing pain in her left hand, she might have believed the nightmare never happened.

She couldn't believe that Vincent—the man who had promised to protect her—had personally ordered her finger severed.

Her phone was still in her pocket. Trembling, she clutched it with her right hand, considering calling the police.

But the King family ruled Harbor City with an iron grip, and with the Bowman family's influence, it would be futile. More importantly... she still couldn't forget the boy who had once fought alongside her for survival.

Gritting her teeth, she forced herself up. She hadn't eaten in a day. If this continued, her stomach cancer would claim her life even sooner.

Living was exhausting—physically and emotionally. But she had to endure. Every extra day she survived meant one more chance to secure Daniel's surgery funds.

Just as she finished cooking a bowl of sweet corn porridge, the doorbell rang urgently.

Susan tensed, fearing Vincent's men had come for more retribution. But when she opened the door, she found Bella Quinn standing there, her face covered in bruises.

Her best friend turned her face slightly, but even thick foundation couldn't conceal the injuries.

"Susan, here's $150,000." Bella shoved a bulging paper bag into her hands. "I know it's not enough, but I'll figure something out."

Susan suddenly grabbed Bella's left wrist—the jade bracelet she never took off was missing.

"You sold your bracelet?"

Bella avoided her gaze. "I... never liked wearing jewelry anyway."

"You're lying!" Susan's voice trembled. That bracelet was a gift from Bruce Bowman for Bella's eighteenth birthday. She had worn it for seven years without ever removing it.

"Susan, don't." Bella forced a smile. "I don't love Bruce anymore. He gave me away to someone else. Clinging to him would just make me pathetic. I refuse to be pathetic."

Susan pulled her into a tight embrace.

This kind-hearted girl deserved the greatest love story. At eight years old, Bella had rescued a little boy from earthquake rubble. He gave her a jade pendant and promised to marry her when they grew up.

But the pendant was lost, and the promise shattered. By the time she became the Bowman family's adopted daughter, Bruce already had Michelle Thompson by his side.

A month ago, Bella was framed for seducing Bruce at his engagement party. Michelle jumped into the sea and broke both legs. Bruce, consumed by hatred, married Bella off to the sadistic cripple Simon Finch as punishment.

"Simon isn't that bad, really." Bella forced another smile. "Susan, we'll both be okay."

Susan stayed silent. She knew her life was on borrowed time and didn't want to burden her friend further.

Just as she was about to change the subject, Bella suddenly grabbed her left hand.

"Where's your finger?!"

Beneath the loose bandage, the tip of her pinky was unmistakably missing.

"Was it Nicole? I'll kill her!" The usually gentle Bella's eyes turned red with rage as she stormed into the kitchen and grabbed a cleaver.

Susan yanked her back. "It was Vincent. But I don't care anymore. Bella, my time is running out—"

"Don't say that!" Tears streamed down Bella's face. "We're going to the hospital right now!"

As they moved toward the door, the phone on the table suddenly buzzed violently.
###Chapter 25: The Faustian Bargain

The phone's shrill ringtone shattered the silence as Susan Thompson tended to Bella Quinn's wound.

Her fingers trembled when she saw the name flashing on the screen. Simon Finch's name burned her retinas like a branding iron.

"Hello?" She forced steadiness into her voice as she answered.

"You slut! Off whoring around again?" Simon's hysterical scream pierced through the receiver. "Get your ass home now!"

Susan bit her lower lip until it turned white. "I'm at a friend's place. I'll be—"

"Later?" Simon's chilling laugh made her blood run cold. "Should I stop your grandmother's dialysis then?"

The word "dialysis" paralyzed Susan. Visions of her grandmother writhing in pain last month flooded her mind.

"I'm coming." She hung up, red-rimmed eyes meeting Bella's. "I have to go."

Bella watched her friend flee into the rainstorm, heart breaking. She'd heard Bruce Bowman's name through the phone—knew Susan was returning to that living hell.

Outside, the downpour intensified. Bella's fingers brushed against the crumpled hospital bill in her pocket. Daniel's surgery fund remained desperately short.

Then fate intervened.

"Eighty thousand per cadaver," a nurse's gossip floated down the hospital corridor. "That new medical research institute pays top dollar."

Bella froze mid-step.

Three days later, she stood in the institute's office, signing the Organ Donation Agreement with shaking hands.

"Miss Thompson, are you certain about taking the seventy-thousand advance?" The clerk hesitated before handing over the check.

"My son can't wait." Bella clutched the check like a lifeline.

Sunlight blinded her as she stepped outside. Combined with Susan's fifteen thousand, the surgery fund was nearly complete.

That evening, Bella faced the gilded mirror at A Variety of Beauties. The crimson cheongsam accentuated her porcelain skin, while the white glove concealed her festering wound.

"Diamond Suite needs staff. You're up." The manager's appreciative leer made her skin crawl.

The elevator doors parted. Bella adjusted her collar—and collided with Henry Bartley's smirking face.

"Destiny." Henry seized her wrist, eyes glinting dangerously. "Four years. Did you miss me?"

Her back hit cold marble as his cologne assaulted her senses. Memories of that rainy night four years ago churned her stomach.

"Let go!" She struggled against his iron grip.

"Playing hard to get?" Henry sneered. "A cocktail waitress rejecting me?"

His hand slid up her thigh. Bella kneed him in the groin. As he doubled over, she bolted for the emergency exit.

Henry's enraged roar and pounding footsteps pursued her. Her heart threatened to burst through her ribcage.

Rounding a corner, she crashed into a solid chest. Looking up, she met fathomless dark eyes—

Andrew Lucas.
###Chapter 26 Nicole, You Make Me Sick!

Susan gasped in pain as Henry Bartley smirked cruelly. He leaned in, his bloodstained lips nearly brushing her cheek.

"Get away!"

Her stomach churned. No one disgusted her more than Henry.

As she raised her right hand, he viciously grabbed her injured left. White-hot agony shot through her severed finger, sapping her strength.

"Hurts?" Henry relished her pained expression. "I love seeing you like this."

Blood seeped through her glove as he tightened his grip.

"Monster!"

Susan trembled from head to toe, her fingertips shaking.

"Quite the scene, Mr. Bartley."

A cold voice cut through the tension. Susan's heart lurched—Andrew Lucas stood there.

Henry lazily draped an arm around her. "Looking for fun, Mr. Lucas? I've had her many times. Tastes sweet. Want a try?"

"Andrew..." Nicole Capra clung to his sleeve, her thick makeup failing to hide swollen cheeks.

"Filthy." Andrew's gaze turned glacial. "I'd rather not."

Nicole simpered, "She has her reasons..."

Susan clapped a hand over her mouth. The hypocrisy made her nauseous.

"Sister," Nicole cooed, grabbing her hand, "stop ruining yourself—"

"Hah!"

Susan's laugh was razor-sharp.

"Nicole, your act makes me sick!" She spun toward a trash can, retching. "Stop playing the innocent!"

Nicole paled, turning tearful eyes to Andrew.

"You'll always be pure to me." He pulled her close.

Pure? Susan's stomach heaved. If only he knew Nicole's dirty secrets with Henry.

Henry seized Susan's waist. "Don't be mad, darling. Let's make that baby. Once you're pregnant, I'll marry you and bring Daniel home!"

"Shut up!" Susan's eyes burned. Andrew already doubted Daniel's parentage—this was fuel to the fire.

Andrew's lips curled in scorn.

"Want a front-row show, Mr. Lucas?" Henry planted a sloppy kiss on Susan's cheek.

Andrew's fists cracked, but Nicole tugged him away.

As Susan struggled free, Henry dragged her into a private room and threw her down. Pain blurred her vision—she thought it was over.

Then his phone rang. After answering, Henry bolted without a backward glance.

Susan curled on the floor, sweat-drenched from dual agony in her finger and gut. Thirty minutes passed before she could rise.

Pushing open the reserved room's door, she froze.

Andrew stood there, his stormy eyes boring into her.
###Chapter 27: Susan Meets a Gentleman, While Jealous Andrew Seethes

Susan's fingers trembled as she pushed open the private room door.

Andrew Lucas's tall frame came into view, with Nicole Capra clinging to his shoulder like a delicate bird. The sight burned her eyes.

She instinctively wanted to flee.

Her hand froze on the doorknob. A self-mocking smile curled her lips. Why should she care about their sweet intimacy?

Taking a deep breath, she stepped inside.

The room was warm, yet Susan felt chilled to the bone. The painkillers were wearing off, and every step felt like walking on knives.

Crack!

The sound of shattering glass cut through the air.

Andrew's wineglass exploded in his hand. Blood mixed with red wine dripped from his knuckles.

"Andrew!" Nicole gasped, reaching for him.

He coldly avoided her touch, hiding his injured hand behind his back. His dark eyes locked onto Susan's trembling legs, a storm brewing in their depths.

"Who are you hurting yourself for, Andrew?" Ethan Sullivan teased as he sauntered over—only to freeze when he saw Susan.

His lighter clattered to the floor.

Her delicate profile glowed under the light, long lashes casting shadows. She reminded him of white magnolias in a misty southern rain.

"Let me help." Without thinking, he took her hand.

The moment their skin touched, Ethan's ears turned red. The usually smooth-talking Sullivan heir stammered, "I—I—"

Susan quickly pulled away, the cork popping free.

"Calvin! Pinch me!" Ethan suddenly whirled to grab his friend.

Calvin Grant rolled his eyes but obliged.

"It's real!" Ethan grinned like a fool, eyes shining. "I'm in love!"

Silence filled the room.

Susan couldn't help stealing a glance at this lively character, her lips quirking up. Who knew Nicole's brother could be so amusing?

Bang!

Andrew kicked over the coffee table.

Wine bottles rolled across the floor, dark liquid spreading like the murderous rage in someone's eyes.
###Chapter 28: A Misunderstood Love at First Sight

Susan Thompson was carrying a tray down the hallway when a lively figure suddenly blocked her path.

"Miss!" Ethan Sullivan's eyes sparkled as if he'd discovered a rare treasure. "I'm in love!"

The wine glasses on the tray trembled slightly. Susan was momentarily speechless. She'd seen many intoxicated guests, but none had ever rushed over to declare their love so boldly.

Her gaze flickered between Ethan and Calvin Grant. Then, understanding dawned. She offered a professional smile. "Congratulations to you both. Would you like champagne to celebrate?"

The private room fell dead silent.

Calvin's face darkened like a storm cloud. "Are you blind?"

"Wait, no! It's a misunderstanding!" Ethan waved his hands frantically, his ears turning red. "I meant... I meant you..."

Bruce Bowman suddenly burst into laughter, spilling half his whiskey.

Only then did Susan realize her mistake. Her cheeks burned. "My apologies. I misunderstood."

"It's fine!" Ethan stared at her intently. "What I meant to say was..."

"Interrogating her now?" Calvin cut in coldly. "Ask too much, and you'll scare her away."

Flustered, Ethan abruptly pulled Susan into his arms. "I like you! From the first moment I saw you!"

Susan froze. She'd endured countless hollow flirtations, but this man's heartbeat thundered against her ear like a frantic drum.

"I felt like something was missing," Ethan murmured, "until I saw you..."

"Do you even know who she is?" Andrew Lucas's voice was icy, instantly freezing the warm atmosphere.

Ethan shielded Susan behind him. "She's the woman I'm going to marry!"

"Marry a nightclub hostess?" Andrew sneered. "Not disgusted by the filth?"

Susan's nails dug into her palms. Memories of humiliation surged like a tidal wave, nearly buckling her knees.

"Andrew!" Ethan's rare anger flared. "Apologize!"

He turned and gently wiped the tears from Susan's face. "Don't listen to him. I know you're a good woman."

Her tears fell harder. How long had it been since someone defended her like this? Not since... that person left.

"Let me sing for you?" Ethan fumbled through an off-key lullaby.

Susan laughed through her tears. The clumsy melody comforted her more than any words could.

Behind them, glass shattered violently. Andrew stood amidst the wreckage, his eyes swirling with a terrifying storm.
###Chapter 29: Bloodstained White Gloves

Ethan Sullivan's fingers jerked violently on the guitar strings.

The door to the private room crashed open with a deafening bang that made his eardrums throb. He looked up to meet Andrew Lucas's ice-cold gaze.

"What the hell, Andrew?" Ethan flung the guitar onto the couch. "Can't you see I'm singing for the lady?"

Andrew's eyes slid past him, locking onto Susan Thompson with an intensity that could flay skin.

Nicole Capra dug her nails into her palms. She grabbed Andrew's sleeve, her voice trembling. "Andrew, our baby..."

The words doused Andrew like a bucket of ice water. He slumped back onto the couch, knuckles cracking under the force of his clenched fists.

Nicole exhaled in relief, though a flicker of malice crossed her eyes. Suddenly, she raised her voice. "Ethan, do you know who hurt Mom?"

"Who?" Ethan shot to his feet.

"Her!" Nicole pointed accusingly at Susan. "Susan murdered my child, and now she's coming after Mom!"

Ethan's expression froze. He turned slowly to Susan. "Is it... true?"

Susan's lips trembled. "I didn't—"

"When I got to the hospital room, Aunt Catherine was already..." Her voice broke. "I respected her more than anyone. How could I hurt her?"

The room plunged into suffocating silence.

Then Ethan reached out and ruffled Susan's hair. "I believe you."

Those three words shattered Susan's composure. Tears spilled over as she buried her face in Ethan's chest like a wronged child.

"Silly girl." Ethan wiped her tears with his thumb. "When Mom wakes up, the truth will come out."

He took her hand. "Come on, let's wash your face."

The hallway lights were dim. Ethan suddenly stopped—Susan's white glove was stained with vivid red.

"What happened to your hand?"

Susan hid it behind her back. "Just a scratch."

Ethan yanked off the glove without hesitation. Susan gasped in pain—the wound on her severed finger had festered, the fabric sticking to torn flesh.

"Who did this?!" Ethan's eyes burned red.

Susan lowered her lashes. "I really did it myself—"

"Hospital. Now."

The emergency room blazed with light. Susan bit her lip bloody but never cried out as the doctor treated her wound. Ethan stood rigid, knuckles white.

By dawn, Susan insisted on leaving. Unable to refuse, Ethan took her home.

In the apartment hallway, Andrew stood like a statue at her door. Bloodshot eyes, alcohol-stained suit—he hadn't slept all night.

"Had fun?" His voice was raw with fury.
###Chapter 30: Andrew, We Can't Go Back

Andrew Lucas's eyes burned crimson, like a demon clawing its way from hell.

Susan Thompson instinctively stepped back, hiding her bandaged left hand behind her.

"Andrew, why are you here?"

"Susan, are you with Ethan Sullivan now?" His voice was icy. "Throwing yourself at any man who looks your way—how pathetic."

Susan laughed, the sound laced with bitter mockery.

"Mr. Lucas, we've been over for a long time. Who I'm with is none of your business."

The title "Mr. Lucas" stabbed through Andrew's heart like a blade.

He had seen Ethan drop her off, their lingering farewell.

What had they been doing together all night?

"I'll move out within two weeks." Susan pulled out her keys. "Now step aside."

"Move where? Ethan's place? Or Henry Bartley's?" Andrew seized her wrist. "Susan, are you that desperate for men?"

"Yes, I am." Her smile was careless. "Whatever you say, Mr. Lucas."

"Susan!"

The door crashed open as Andrew shoved her against the wall.

"Since you're so shameless, I'll oblige you."

Susan's lips curved, but her eyes were hollow.

"Too bad I'm not selling myself to you."

The words ignited Andrew's fury.

Pain radiated through her limbs, and Susan felt death creeping close.

But she couldn't die.

Daniel was waiting for her.

When it was over, Susan curled in the corner, blood seeping through her bandages.

"Playing dead?" Andrew yanked her up by the shoulders. "Look at me!"

Tear tracks streaked Susan's face.

"Don't touch me..." Her whisper was barely audible. "We're divorced..."

Andrew noticed her bloodied hand.

"A sympathy ploy?" He ripped off the bandage with a cold laugh.

Susan struggled to pull away, but his grip was iron.

"Andrew..." Her voice was a broken sigh. "We can't go back..."
###Chapter 31: The Mystery of the Severed Finger

"Don't touch me..."

Susan Thompson struggled desperately, her entire body trembling from the excruciating pain in her left hand. Even though Andrew Lucas had long discarded her like trash, she still refused to let him see her at her most wretched state.

Her right hand feebly clawed at the air, trying to break free from Andrew's grip. But her resistance was laughable against his strength. The bandage, glued to her wound by dried blood, tore away as he yanked it, sending a wave of agony so intense she nearly blacked out.

"Stop pretending!" Andrew sneered, tightening his grip abruptly.

"Ah—!"

A piercing scream tore from Susan's throat as she curled into a fetal position. Cold sweat drenched her hospital gown in seconds, her vision flickering in and out of darkness.

Andrew's mocking words died in his throat.

His gaze locked onto the mutilated hand, his pupils contracting violently. The jagged wound where her finger should have been still oozed blood, pus mingling with crimson in a grotesque sight.

"Where is your finger?!"

He seized her shoulder, his voice laced with terrifying fury. His knuckles turned white from the force, as if he meant to crush her bones.

"Speak! Who did this?!"

Susan had already passed out from the pain, collapsing limply into his arms.

"Susan!"

Andrew scooped her up and stormed out of the apartment. The elevator was too slow—he took the stairs, his footsteps echoing through the empty stairwell.

"It hurts..."

Her faint whimper sent a jolt through his chest.

"Hold on. We're almost at the hospital." His voice softened instinctively.

"Andrew..." Susan murmured deliriously. "My heart... hurts..."

His arms tightened around her, his own heart seized by an invisible fist. He quickened his pace, his black trench coat flapping behind him in the night wind.

In the hospital corridor, a team of specialists waited nervously.

"Fix her." Andrew grabbed the lead doctor by the collar. "I don't want to hear her cry in pain again!"

The doctor glanced at Susan's lifeless form on the bed, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. "M-Mr. Lucas, about the patient's severed finger—"

"Can you reattach it?" Andrew's voice was hoarse. "Money is no object. I want her whole again!"

Leo Miller, his assistant, cautiously approached. "Sir, should we check Willow Lane?"

"No need." Andrew's eyes darkened. "It's not there."

Leo sucked in a sharp breath. Did his boss already...? He didn't dare finish the thought, hesitating as he reached for his phone. Should he inform the Lucas family?

"Interfere, and you're fired." Andrew shot him a chilling glare.

Inside the room, specialists worked to stitch Susan's wound. Andrew stood by the window, unaware of the cigarette burning down to his fingers. Only when the searing pain hit did he snap back to reality.

At dusk, Susan finally opened her eyes.

Andrew loomed over her immediately, his bloodshot eyes boring into hers. "Where is the finger?"

"Fed it to the dogs," she replied flatly.

"Who did this?!" He seized her wrist, his voice trembling with something even he didn't recognize. "Susan, tell me the truth!"

Susan stared at the ceiling, her lips curling into a bleak smile.

That answer—she would take it to her grave.
###Chapter 32: Andrew, Let's End This Here

Susan Thompson slowly opened her eyes, the antiseptic smell of the hospital room making her frown slightly. The evening light faded outside the window as she stared at her own reflection in the glass, suddenly finding it unfamiliar.

"Andrew." Her voice was soft, as if afraid to disturb something. "If I told you Nicole Capra ordered someone to cut off my fingers, would you believe me?"

Andrew Lucas's eyes turned icy in an instant.

"Susan!" He gripped her chin roughly. "Nicole is still lying in a hospital bed, and you dare slander her?"

Susan laughed, tears streaming down her face.

"See? I knew you wouldn't believe me."

She turned her face toward the window, where neon lights flickered on one by one like countless mocking eyes.

"Andrew, do you remember?" she whispered. "You promised you'd always believe me."

Andrew's hand tightened abruptly, his knuckles turning white.

"Susan, snap out of it!" He forced her face back toward him. "Stop playing the victim!"

Susan looked into his bloodshot eyes and suddenly felt exhausted beyond words.

"Andrew, I don’t want to explain anymore." She closed her eyes. "You won’t believe me no matter what I say. Why humiliate myself?"

Andrew's chest heaved violently as he shoved her away.

"Fine. Perfect!" He sneered. "Susan, I’m warning you—stay away from Nicole. Or else—"

"Or else what?" Susan opened her eyes, staring at him calmly. "Kill me?"

The emptiness in her gaze struck him like a blade. He turned and stormed out.

The door slammed shut with such force that the IV stand trembled.

Susan stared at the ceiling, suddenly remembering that day under the cherry blossoms when a young boy had held her hands and said, "Susan, I’ll always protect you."

How laughable.

With great effort, she pushed herself up and pulled out the IV needle. Daniel’s medical bills were still far from covered—she had no time for self-pity.

The discharge process went smoothly. Andrew had already paid all the fees. Susan clutched the bill, her nails digging into her palms.

The manager of A Variety of Beauties looked conflicted when he saw her, handing her a thick envelope.

"Your commission from Mr. Ethan Sullivan’s visit last night."

Susan counted it—nearly 100,000. Before she could feel any relief, the manager added, "You’re fired."

Expected.

She walked down the street, clutching the money in a paper bag, the cold wind biting her skin. Her phone rang—a call from Sister Zhao, an acquaintance from her days as an extra.

"Susan, a big production needs background actors tomorrow—playing corpses. 500 a day. Interested?"

Susan agreed without hesitation.

The next day, she realized it was Nicole’s film. Keeping her head down, Susan smeared fake blood on herself, trying to stay unnoticed.

"Action!"

At the director’s cue, Susan and the other extras collapsed into the "blood." The click of high heels approached, stopping beside her.

A sharp pain shot through her left hand—Nicole’s heel was grinding into her severed finger.

"Hurts?" Nicole whispered, low enough for only Susan to hear. "This is just the beginning."

Susan clenched her teeth, sweat soaking her costume.

Nicole suddenly shrieked and stumbled back.

"Cut!" the director yelled. "What happened?"

"She pinched me!" Nicole pointed at Susan, tears instantly welling up.

The set erupted in murmurs.

Before Susan could defend herself, a familiar figure charged forward.

"Susan!" Andrew yanked her up from the ground. "You’ve got a death wish!"

His palm came down like a whip.
###Chapter 33: Nicole, Apologize to Susan!

A sharp slap echoed across the film set.

Nicole Capra's head snapped sideways, her meticulously applied makeup instantly distorted.

Ethan Sullivan shoved her away, sending her stumbling to the ground.

"You hit me?" Nicole clutched her cheek, tears welling up.

"Shut up!" Ethan's eyes burned with fury as he saw Susan Thompson's pale face. "You knew about her hand injury!"

"I'm your own sister!" Nicole's voice trembled. "How could you choose some outsider—"

"Outsider?" Ethan sneered. "Who was it that rushed to tell me Susan harmed our mother just two nights ago?"

He bent down to help Susan up, his pupils contracting at the sight of blood seeping through her bandage.

"To the hospital."

Susan shook her head slightly. "It's just prop blood."

The director hesitantly approached. "Mr. Sullivan, this is—"

"Visiting my girlfriend. Problem?"

The director stole a glance at Susan, realizing her natural beauty outshone Nicole's heavy makeup. No wonder the young master was smitten.

"Nicole," Ethan's voice turned glacial. "Apologize."

"I was just following the script!" Nicole turned to the director. "Right?"

The director forced a smile. "Well...the script does require—"

"Cut the crap!" Ethan interrupted. "Final warning, Nicole."

Nicole suddenly turned tearful eyes toward Susan. "Why must you always target me? We were once like sisters..."

The director quickly chimed in. "Yes, harmony brings prosperity—"

Susan suddenly pulled out her phone.

Nicole's venomous voice blared from the speaker: "Enjoying this, Susan?"

The set fell dead silent.

Every gaze toward Nicole shifted with dawning realization.

"You recorded me?!" Nicole's face darkened, her mask slipping completely. "You bitch!"

She quickly reassumed a wounded expression. "I treated you with sincerity, yet you—"

"Enough!" Ethan thundered. "Apologize, or face the consequences."

Susan straightened her spine, her slender frame radiating unyielding dignity.

The truth had surfaced. The victor was clear.
###Chapter 34: A Dance That Stole Hearts

Nicole Capra's knuckles turned white as she gripped her phone. Apologizing to Susan Thompson? The thought was worse than death. But Ethan Sullivan's furious glare kept her in check, his warning "face the consequences" hanging over her like a blade.

"Susan, I'm sorry." She forced the words through gritted teeth before turning away to dial Andrew Lucas' number, her voice instantly trembling with tears. "Andrew, someone bullied me..."

Susan watched Nicole flee, a cold smirk playing on her lips. The insincere apology meant nothing, but seeing Nicole humiliated was satisfying.

"Susan, your wound needs medical attention!" Ethan fretted, wringing his hands, wanting to touch but afraid to hurt her bandaged hand.

"It's really fine." Susan flexed her wrist. "Thank you, Ethan."

The tips of Ethan's ears turned red as he scratched his head awkwardly. "I won't let anyone bully you!"

Warmth bloomed in Susan's chest. If only she had more time... Before she could speak, a frantic crew member rushed over.

"Director! The dance double fell and was taken to the hospital!"

"What?!" Director Cyrus grabbed his thinning hair. "We spent 800,000 just on today's set! Where are we going to find a replacement now?"

Susan's eyes lit up. She had been the star of her dance class since childhood—her teacher once said she was born for the stage. Though she never became a professional, filling in as a double was more than enough.

"Director, let me try?"

Director Cyrus eyed her skeptically. "Do well, and I'll pay you 10,000."

Susan's heart raced. That was five times what she'd expected!

In the makeup room, the artist marveled. "Your bone structure is wasted off-camera." The mirror reflected Susan's exquisite features, a touch of crimson at the corners of her eyes adding an ethereal allure.

On the peach blossom set, petals drifted like snow.

Susan took a deep breath. Seeing Ethan waving encouragingly from below, her nerves melted away. As the music swelled, she transformed into the fox spirit who danced to her death for love.

Her sleeves fluttered like wings, shaking the blossoms from the trees. With each graceful arch of her waist and chime of silver bells, the audience held their breath. This wasn't just a dance—it was a fairy's soliloquy under moonlight.

Andrew pushed open the studio doors just in time to witness it.

A woman in red spun through the falling petals, her bare feet barely touching the scattered blooms. When she tilted her head back, a single tear traced her cheek—heart-stoppingly beautiful.

"Cut! Perfect!" the director shouted excitedly.

Andrew's face darkened. Especially when he saw Ethan staring at Susan, nose bleeding like an idiot. His fists clenched audibly.

Who was she seducing now?
###Chapter 35: A Storm of Jealousy

Andrew Lucas's fists clenched until his knuckles cracked.

Ethan Sullivan was completely absorbed in watching when someone shoved him violently. Stumbling to regain his balance, he turned and met a pair of dark, furious eyes.

"Andrew, are you insane?" Ethan rubbed his sore shoulder. "Can't you see I'm admiring Susan's dance?"

Andrew smirked coldly, his gaze sharp as a blade.

"Move." His voice was icy.

Ethan didn't budge. Instead, he stepped forward, blocking Andrew's view. "Why should I? Susan is my fiancée. I can watch her however I want!"

A flash of crimson flickered in Andrew's eyes.

"Fiancée?" He scoffed. "She's not worthy."

Ethan bristled instantly. "What the hell do you mean? What's wrong with Susan? Her dancing is breathtaking, and she's so gentle—"

Before he could finish, warmth trickled from his nose.

"You're bleeding." Andrew's tone was indifferent.

Ethan fumbled to wipe the blood but still managed to boast, "That just proves how captivating my Susan is!"

Andrew's expression darkened further.

"You two aren't right for each other." He practically spat the words through gritted teeth.

Ethan stared at him like he was a lunatic. "Did you take the wrong pills today? Susan and I are a match made in heaven. What's not right about us?"

Suddenly, his eyes widened in realization. "Wait—don't tell me... you have feelings for Susan?"

Andrew's pupils constricted.

"Don't talk nonsense!" he snapped.

But Ethan only grew more animated. "Then why do you care if we're right for each other? Andrew, I'm warning you—Susan is mine. No one gets to take her from me!"

Just then, Susan's dance came to an end.

Ethan immediately rushed forward, sweeping her into his arms and spinning her around.

"Susan, you were amazing!" He beamed like an excited child. "Promise me you'll only dance like that for me, okay?"

Dizzy from the spinning, Susan was about to respond when she locked eyes with a chilling gaze.

Andrew was staring straight at them, his expression murderous.

Her heart skipped a beat, and she instinctively tried to pull away from Ethan's embrace.

"Don't move," Ethan murmured near her ear. "You're barely dressed. You'll catch a cold."

He draped his jacket over her shoulders and deliberately raised his voice. "Come on, let's get you changed."

As they passed Andrew, Ethan shot him a defiant look.

Every muscle in Andrew's body tensed. Memories flooded his mind—

She had once danced for him like this, on his birthday. Under the moonlight, she had whispered in his ear that she would dance only for him.

And now, was she going to say the same thing to another man?

Andrew took a sudden step forward.

"Andrew!" Nicole Capra let out a dramatic cry, clutching her stomach as she collapsed against him. "It hurts so much..."

Instinctively, he caught her, but his eyes remained fixed on the retreating figures.

"Andrew..." Nicole's eyes welled with tears. "Is it because I lost the baby... that you don't want to marry me anymore?"

Only then did Andrew snap back to reality.

"Don't be ridiculous," he said stiffly.

Nicole sobbed harder. "It's all my fault... I couldn't protect our child..."

"It wasn't your fault," Andrew replied mechanically, but his mind was still filled with the image of Susan in Ethan's arms.

Nicole pinched herself discreetly, forcing more tears. "Then... will you still marry me?"

Andrew fell silent for a long moment before finally tearing his gaze away.

"Of course," he said. "I'll marry you."

But his fists never unclenched.
###Chapter 36: Nicole, I'll Marry You!

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows. For a moment, Andrew Lucas saw seventeen-year-old Susan Thompson standing in the golden rays.

She rose on tiptoe, cheeks flushed as she whispered in his ear, "Andrew, I want to be your bride someday."

His heart had pounded wildly as he pulled her close. "Susan, you're the only one I'll ever marry."

The memory receded like the tide, leaving only cold reality.

The girl who'd promised to be his bride had killed their child, crippled his leg, and walked straight into another man's arms.

"Andrew?" Nicole Capra tugged nervously at his sleeve. "If you're not ready yet—"

"We'll get engaged next week." His voice was glacial.

Nicole nearly jumped for joy. She leaned in for a kiss, but he deftly avoided her.

"I'll get the car." Andrew strode away, his posture rigid as a pine.

Nicole touched her burning cheeks. It didn't matter. Once she became Mrs. Lucas, she'd have all the time in the world to melt that icy exterior.

Meanwhile, Susan had just changed clothes when Ethan Sullivan cornered her at the door.

"Susan, there's this new Japanese place—"

"Mr. Sullivan." She took a step back. "There's something you should know."

She drew a deep breath. "I'm divorced. And I have a three-and-a-half-year-old son."

Ethan's smile froze.

Susan turned to leave, but he grabbed her wrist.

"So you're single now?" His eyes suddenly sparkled. "Perfect!"

Susan blinked.

"Boy or girl? What toys does he like?" Ethan was already pulling out his phone. "I'll order some right now!"

"Wait—"

"His name's Daniel, right?" Ethan steered her toward the parking lot. "What's his favorite food? I'll have my chef prepare it."

The barrage of questions left Susan dizzy.

Thirty minutes later, Ethan stood outside the hospital room clutching an armload of toys, nervously adjusting his tie.

"How do I look?"

Little Daniel studied the unfamiliar man from his bed.

"Mommy, who...?"

"I'm Uncle Ethan!" He bounded forward, presenting the toys like treasures. "Look what I brought you!"

Susan massaged her temples. The man's familiarity was downright shameless.

But when she saw Daniel's rare smile, something inside her softened.
###Chapter 37: Andrew, Meet My Son!

"Daniel!" Ethan Sullivan's eyes crinkled into happy crescents. "I want to pursue your mother. That means I'll be your dad now!"

"Dad..." Daniel Almond repeated the unfamiliar title softly, his eyes gradually dimming.

Ethan nervously rubbed his hands together. "Daniel, do you dislike me? I promise to take good care of you and your mom."

Daniel quickly shook his head. "I like you very much. I'd be happy if you became my dad."

His small fingers secretly tightened around the bedsheet. Though he still missed his biological father, that man had treated Mom terribly. And... his time was running out. Mom needed someone to rely on.

"Really?!" Ethan became incoherent with excitement. "Then... call me Dad right now!"

"Dad!" Daniel's clear voice rang out.

Susan Thompson hastily interrupted. "Daniel, Uncle is fine."

"Susan, you're interfering with the child's freedom!" Ethan declared righteously. "Daniel likes me. Why can't he call me Dad?"

Susan was momentarily speechless.

Daniel tugged her sleeve with damp eyes. "Mommy, I want a dad..."

Susan's heart melted instantly. She could never resist that look from Daniel.

"See? Daniel acknowledges me as his father!" Ethan preened like a peacock spreading its tail.

"Dad will protect you both." He solemnly clasped Daniel's small hand.

Suddenly Daniel said, "Mommy, I want the braised pork from the cafeteria."

After Susan left, Daniel looked seriously at Ethan. "Dad, can you promise me something?"

"Anything!"

"If I'm... not here anymore, please be good to Mommy." Daniel's voice was barely audible. "She works multiple jobs every day to pay for my treatment."

Ethan's nose stung. He roughly ruffled Daniel's hair. "Silly boy, with Dad here, you'll definitely get better!"

When Susan returned, she found both their eyes suspiciously red.

After lunch, Ethan hummed cheerfully as he left the hospital. The moment he got in his car, he excitedly called Andrew Lucas. "Andrew, meet my son tonight! Don't forget a big red envelope!"

He proceeded to call all his friends before finally driving off, thoroughly satisfied.

That evening, Ethan arrived punctually to pick up mother and son. Susan had suggested an ordinary restaurant, but Ethan brought them to the renowned "Elegant Joy."

"This place is too expensive—" Susan froze mid-sentence.

At the end of the hallway, Andrew Lucas was walking toward them arm-in-arm with Nicole Capra.

Ethan immediately scooped up Daniel and swung him proudly. "Andrew, look at my son! Adorable, isn't he?"
###Chapter 38: Ethan, Susan Is So Disgusting!

The moment the private room door swung open, Daniel's smile froze.

His small hands clutched Susan's sleeve tightly as he glared at the man in the doorway.

"Daniel, this is Uncle Andrew!" Ethan Sullivan announced cheerfully. "Say hello!"

Andrew Lucas's gaze cut into Susan like a blade, sharp enough to flay her alive.

Nicole Capra quickly pulled a thick red envelope from her purse, offering it to Daniel with a sweet smile. "This is a little gift for our first meeting."

Daniel turned his face away in disgust, but Ethan snatched the envelope and stuffed it into his arms.

"Come on, let's go collect more gifts!" Ethan scooped Daniel up and carried him further inside.

The room was already filled with guests. Bruce Bowman and Calvin Grant immediately smiled and handed over their prepared red envelopes.

"What a charming boy," Bruce said, ruffling Daniel's hair.

Calvin suddenly gasped, pointing at Daniel. "Andrew, look! This kid is the spitting image of Ethan!"

Everyone turned to notice the striking resemblance—Daniel and Ethan shared nearly identical features.

Ethan spun Daniel around excitedly. "See? I told you we look like father and son!"

He grabbed Susan's hand, eyes shining. "Susan, even strangers can see it!"

Susan stared at the two similar faces, momentarily dazed. She had never imagined Daniel could resemble someone unrelated to him so closely.

"Andrew, jealous?" Ethan smirked at Andrew. "Why don't you try having such an adorable son?"

A glass shattered in Andrew's grip.

"Whose son did you say this is?" His voice was icy.

"Mine, of course!" Ethan shot back. "What, you think he's yours?"

"Bastard." The venomous word slipped from Andrew's lips.

Daniel's face went pale.

Susan trembled, her nails digging into her palms.

Ethan slammed his hands on the table and stood. "Andrew Lucas! Say that again and see what happens!"

He squeezed Susan's cold hand, his voice firm but gentle. "Don't be afraid, Susan. I'm here."

Andrew let out a cold laugh. "Ethan, is this woman really worth defending?"

He rose slowly, looking down at Susan with contempt. "A used-up slut, and you still want her?"

Susan's blood turned to ice.

The air in the room plummeted to freezing.
###Chapter 39: Ethan's Kiss That Sealed Their Fate

The air in the private room turned suffocating.

Susan clenched the hem of her dress, her nails digging into her palms. She refused to become a laughingstock under those scornful gazes.

Andrew's piercing stare felt like a blade, stripping away the last shred of her dignity.

Just as she gathered Daniel in her arms to flee, a deafening crash shattered the silence.

Ethan smashed a liquor bottle against the floor, sending glass shards flying. The usual sunshine in his eyes had vanished, replaced by an icy fury.

"Andrew," he growled. "Apologize to Susan."

Susan froze. She'd imagined countless scenarios—but never this. Never Ethan standing up for her.

Gently settling Daniel back onto the seat, she was suddenly pulled into a warm embrace. Ethan's arms locked around her like steel.

"I promised no one would hurt you while I'm here."

Tears spilled uncontrollably. Staring up at his boyish face, Susan realized for the first time—this was a man who could protect her.

"Don't cry." He clumsily wiped her cheeks. "My heart is yours. My life is yours."

Andrew's expression darkened. He lunged forward, gripping Ethan's wrist.

"Have you lost your mind?"

A fist swung through the air. Andrew dodged and retaliated with a punch that split Ethan's lip.

"Ethan!" Susan threw herself between them.

Calvin produced a deck of cards with perfect timing. "Let's play a game. Loser draws a punishment."

Ethan lost the first round. The slip he drew left everyone speechless: Kiss someone in this room.

"I don't swing that way," Calvin said, raising his hands.

Bruce turned his face away coldly. "Neither do I."

Ethan's eyes lit up as he turned to Susan. "Help me out?"

"Or streak naked through the city," Calvin added meaningfully.

Susan bit her lip. As she started to nod, Andrew spoke abruptly:

"I'll do it."

The temperature in the room plummeted.
###Chapter 40: Susan, Who's the Father of That Bastard!

"Pfft—"

Ethan Sullivan had just taken a sip of red wine to steel himself for an intimate moment with Susan Thompson when the liquid caught violently in his throat.

Andrew Lucas's icy voice exploded like thunder: "I'll take the dare."

"Andrew, have you lost your mind?!" Ethan's hand trembled, nearly dropping the wine glass.

Andrew advanced with an impassive face. "A bet's a bet."

Ethan's complexion turned ashen. By the rules of the game, he couldn't refuse the challenger's request.

Gritting his teeth, he leaned toward Andrew, brushing his lips fleetingly against the other man's cheek before turning away to gag.

In that moment, sudden clarity struck Ethan.

Andrew's strange warnings on set, his constant targeting of Susan tonight, this absurd dare—it all made sense now.

Andrew was hopelessly in love with him!

Ethan raked his hands through his hair in anguish. Torn between his childhood friend and the woman he loved, the choice was unbearable.

Susan stood frozen in shock. She knew Andrew's possessive nature too well—even things he discarded, no one else could touch.

A metallic taste flooded her mouth. "Excuse me," she murmured, rising abruptly. "I need the restroom."

As the door clicked shut, Ethan drew a deep breath. "Andrew, we need to talk."

Andrew's glare could freeze hell.

"I understand your feelings now." Ethan spoke with pained sincerity. "But we're brothers!"

Andrew's eyebrow twitched violently.

"I admit my irresistible charm is my own fault." Ethan sighed with narcissistic regret. "But my heart belongs only to Susan. You... should let go."

"Get out!" Andrew slammed the door behind him.

Ethan turned mournfully to the remaining two men. "Was I too harsh?"

Calvin Grant and Bruce Bowman averted their eyes in perfect unison.

Spotting Nicole Capra's contorted expression, Ethan added guiltily, "Sis, this is all because I'm too—"

"Enough!" Nicole shattered her glass and stormed out.

In the restroom, Susan hunched over the sink, coughing violently. Crimson stains bloomed across the white porcelain like grotesque flowers.

Her hands shook as she swallowed triple the prescribed dose. Her legs felt leaden, each step an ordeal.

The doctor's warning echoed—overdosing would accelerate organ failure. But the pain left no room for caution.

As she turned, she collided with an immovable force. An iron grip closed around her throat.

"Tell me!" Andrew's voice was deadly calm. "Who's the father of that bastard?"
###Chapter 41: A Heart Turned to Ashes

Susan's lips twisted into a bitter smile. Choking her—it was the only move he ever knew.

She closed her eyes briefly before opening them again, her body drained of all strength. All she wanted was to take Daniel home, collapse onto the bed, and sleep.

"Speak!"

Andrew's eyes burned crimson, like a beast consumed by rage, as if he might tear her apart at any second.

"Susan, is that bastard Henry's spawn or Ethan's?!"

His hands trembled, veins bulging on the back of his hands, his entire body radiating terrifying fury.

He had once believed Daniel was Henry's child, but tonight, seeing that face so eerily resembling Ethan's, doubt clawed at him. The thought that she might have been entangled with so many men four years ago made him wish he could grind her bones to dust.

Susan found the question laughable. He would rather believe Daniel belonged to anyone but him.

"Mr. Lucas, since you refuse to acknowledge Daniel, why does it matter whose child he is?"

Her indifferent tone ignited Andrew's fury.

His fingers tightened around her throat. "Susan, that bastard looks just like Ethan—he's his, isn't he?!"

The first time he choked her, it had hurt. But after so much pain, she had grown numb. Even now, struggling to breathe, she felt nothing but exhaustion.

She didn’t know why Daniel resembled Ethan. Maybe fate, maybe coincidence. But she couldn’t be bothered to explain.

"Mr. Lucas, you're overstepping," she forced out. "We're divorced. My life is none of your concern."

"You always told me not to humiliate myself. Now I'm telling you—stop humiliating yourself!"

"When I loved you, you were everything. Now that I don’t, you mean nothing."

"Andrew, I don’t love you anymore. To me, you’re worthless now."

"Susan, say that again!"

She drew a shaky breath. Even in this humiliating position, her innate dignity remained.

"I said you’re worthless. Since you mean nothing, stay out of my life!"

"Let’s go our separate ways and leave each other in peace!"

Bang!

Andrew kicked open the men’s restroom door, sending the occupant scrambling out with his pants half-fastened.

He dragged Susan inside and locked the door.

"Let me go!"

Trapped in the confined space, panic surged through her. She tried to reach for the door, but his iron grip on her wrist left her helpless.

A sharp pain lanced through her stomach, cold sweat drenching her back. She wanted to say she needed to find Daniel, but the agony stole her voice.

Andrew mistook her desperation for Ethan. His rage burned hotter.

"Trying to run to Ethan? Dream on!" He bit down on her lip.

The familiar sensation made her tremble. Every time he tormented her, her clothes ended up torn to shreds. If something happened here, how could she face Daniel?

"We’re divorced! You can’t do this!"

"Divorced?" Andrew sneered. "A woman who sleeps around—why would she care about a piece of paper?"

He pulled out a wad of cash from his wallet and threw it in her face. "Two thousand. More than you’re worth."

The crimson bills scattered like bloodied knives, piercing her heart until it was riddled with holes.

She stared blankly at the money, her face devoid of emotion. No tears, no laughter—just an empty shell.

"Susan!"

Ethan’s frantic voice came from outside the door. Her eyes went completely hollow.

If he saw her like this...
If Daniel was out there too...

The banging grew louder. She closed her eyes in despair, as if she had already died.
###Chapter 42: Nowhere to Hide

"Mr. Lucas... please..."

Susan Thompson's voice was hoarse beyond recognition, as if scraped by sandpaper. She curled up in the bathroom corner, fingernails digging deep into her palms.

"Susan!"

Ethan Sullivan pounded frantically on the bathroom door. The metal doorknob burned against his palm but remained immovable. He kicked the solid wood door with full force, the expensive hotel material absorbing the impact with a dull thud.

He should have noticed something was wrong ten minutes ago.

When Andrew Lucas followed Susan out of the private room, the hairs on his neck stood up. Now, behind this locked door, faint sounds of fabric tearing reached his ears.

"Andrew! Open the damn door!"

Ethan's knuckles turned red. He spun toward the front desk, his suit jacket flapping behind him. Every second waiting for the key felt like torture.

The lock's turning sounded unnaturally loud.

Andrew stepped out calmly, his tie still perfectly straight. Behind him, Susan resembled a butterfly battered by storm, her evening dress in tatters.

"You bastard!"

Ethan's roar echoed through the bathroom. He wrapped his jacket around Susan's trembling shoulders, his heart wrenching when his fingers brushed her ice-cold skin.

Susan buried her face in her knees. What terrified her most wasn't Andrew's violence, but being seen like this by someone important. Daniel's innocent eyes flashed in her mind, making her stomach twist.

"Let's get you to the hospital."

Ethan's voice softened suddenly. He lifted Susan with the care one would give fragile glass art.

Neon lights flashed outside the car window. Staring at the bruises on her wrist, Susan suddenly remembered being carried to the ER by her adoptive mother during a high fever at fifteen.

"Marry me."

Ethan slammed the brakes abruptly. The red traffic light painted his usually cheerful eyes crimson.

Susan jerked her head up.

"I know what you're thinking." Ethan gripped the steering wheel. "Andrew was your ex-husband, wasn't he?"

In the rearview mirror, Susan watched shock bloom across her pale reflection.

"So what?" Ethan turned to her, gaze burning. "I want to marry the Susan standing before me now. Not anyone's ex-wife."

Raindrops suddenly pounded the windshield. Watching the blurred lights outside, Susan saw something fatherly in this man for the first time.
###Chapter 43: Love Bites and Misunderstandings

"What did you say?!" Ethan Sullivan staggered back, his face turning deathly pale.

Susan Thompson took a deep breath and recounted the tangled history between her and Andrew Lucas. The pain she had buried deep inside now poured out effortlessly.

"Daniel is Andrew's child," Susan murmured, lowering her lashes. "He just refuses to believe it."

"As for Nicole..." She hesitated. "She's your biological sister. Believe it or not."

"Susan!" Ethan suddenly pulled her into a tight embrace. "I believe you! Nothing will come between us!"

Her eyes burned with unshed tears. His fierce devotion moved her, yet twisted her heart with sorrow.

She looked up into his determined gaze. Maybe she deserved a second chance?

Then the doctor's cold diagnosis flashed through her mind, crushing that fragile hope.

"Don't reject me yet." Ethan gently stroked her hair. "I can wait."

Before she could respond, he pressed a tender kiss to her forehead and walked away.

Watching his retreating figure, Susan whispered, "I know you're wonderful..."

Hidden in the shadows, Andrew clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white. He had followed out of concern, only to witness this scene.

"Heh." His lips curled into a mirthless smile, the last trace of warmth vanishing from his eyes.

Back in her apartment, Susan scrubbed furiously at the telltale marks on her skin. Only when her flesh turned raw did she finally give up.

As she prepared to leave for the hospital, her legs suddenly gave out. Collapsing onto the couch, she broke into a cold sweat.

Fifteen minutes later, she managed to drag herself up. The bitter taste of painkillers coated her tongue.

The hospital corridor was eerily quiet. Daniel sat on his bed counting red envelopes, his face lighting up when he saw her.

"Mom, Uncle Ethan gave me the thickest envelope!"

She ruffled his hair, relieved the surgery funds were finally secured.

After tucking Daniel in, she barely had time to rest when a sharp pain shot through the back of her neck—

Darkness swallowed her whole.
###Chapter 44: Countdown to Execution

Susan Thompson woke to a searing pain in the back of her neck.

The night outside was pitch black, without a single star. The dim hospital corridor light seeped through the door crack, casting a pale streak across the floor.

She bolted upright, only to find the hospital bed empty.

"Daniel?"

The bathroom door stood wide open, darkness swallowing the space inside. Her heartbeat skyrocketed, fingers trembling uncontrollably.

The hallway clock read 3:00 AM. At this hour, Daniel would never leave the room alone.

The shadowy figure before she lost consciousness flashed in her mind. The throbbing pain confirmed this was no accident.

The monitoring room nurse yawned, "System malfunction. Tonight's footage is inaccessible."

Susan clenched her fists. What kind of coincidence was this?

Her phone vibrated in her palm, an unknown number flashing ominously.

"Your son is with me," a raspy male voice grated like sandpaper. "One million. Before sunset the day after tomorrow."

Her nails dug into her palms. "Why should I believe you?"

Fabric rustled on the other end, followed by Daniel's muffled whimper.

"Mommy..."

"Daniel!" Tears spilled from her eyes. "Don't be afraid, Mommy—"

The call cut off abruptly. A photo arrived—Daniel tied to a chair, mouth taped, eyes brimming with terror.

"One finger per hour you're late," the second text appeared instantly. "Feel free to call the police."

Her vision blurred. She scrolled through her contacts—Ethan Sullivan's number remained unreachable.

Andrew Lucas's voice dripped with impatience when he answered. "What game are you playing now?"

"Daniel's been kidnapped!" Her voice shattered. "They want one million—"

A cold laugh interrupted her. "Susan, your stories keep getting worse."

"It's true! They sent photos—"

"Good Photoshop skills?" Andrew cut in. "If you need money, just say so. No need to use our child."

The line went dead. Staring at the darkened screen, despair churned in her stomach.

Dawn crept across the sky outside. Wiping her face, she began contacting everyone she knew.

Her bank balance read: $23,765.32.

Grabbing her coat, she rushed out. Only one option remained now—to find him.

As the elevator reached the first floor, her phone buzzed again. The new photo showed a gleaming machete beside Daniel.

"41 hours remaining." The caption coiled around her like a venomous snake. "Which finger should we start with?"
###Chapter 45: Andrew, You're So Cruel

"Even if that bastard really got kidnapped..."

Andrew Lucas's voice was as cold as an ice blade, each word piercing Susan Thompson's heart. "It's none of my business!"

The call ended abruptly.

None of his business...

Susan stared at the darkened phone screen, her fingers trembling uncontrollably. She tried to stand up from the hospital bed, but her legs felt like lead.

Tears blurred her vision.

Faintly, she recalled the man's tender vows.

He had once said, "Susan, you and our child are my life."

Now, they had become burdens he dismissed with "none of my business."

Andrew, you're ruthless!

Susan bit her lip hard enough to draw blood, forcing herself to stay upright. She knew if she collapsed now, she'd never get up again.

Pain coursed through her body like thousands of needles. Every step felt like walking on knives.

When she called Andrew again, no one answered.

Outside, the city bustled with traffic and neon lights. Susan grabbed her purse and rushed out, only to turn back and snatch the fruit knife from the bedside table.

If he hated her to the bone, she'd give him what he wanted. As long as she could save Daniel, he could take her life!

This winter in Seaview City was unusually cold. It hadn't snowed when she left the hospital, but by the time she reached Shallow Water Bay, thick flakes were falling.

The villa was brightly lit.

The sign that read "Susan Thompson and Dogs Not Allowed" stood out starkly in the snow.

Perfect, Susan thought. That sign would make a fitting epitaph for her.

She rang the doorbell for over ten minutes, her fingers turning purple from the cold.

Finally, the door opened.

"Go in," the butler said coldly.

"Thank you!" Susan staggered inside.

"Thank Miss Capra instead," the butler sneered. "Mr. Lucas said dogs aren't allowed, but Miss Capra pleaded for an exception."

"Miss Thompson, know your place. Mr. Lucas says seeing you makes him sick for days."

Susan's ears buzzed.

Nicole Capra was here too.

Of course they lived together. Hadn't he divorced her to marry Nicole?

In the living room, Nicole wore a semi-transparent silk nightgown, her curves faintly visible.

"Sister, what brings you here?" She smiled like a white lotus. "Andrew and I were just... well, you know how he can't keep his hands off me."

"I barely managed to slip away, and now I have to go back and soothe him." Nicole covered her lips coyly. "Looks like I won't be sleeping tonight."

Susan had no patience for her act.

"I need to see Andrew."

"Sister, don't humiliate yourself," Nicole sighed. "Tell me what you need."

In a flash, Susan pressed the fruit knife against Nicole's chest.

"Andrew Lucas!" she screamed toward the upstairs. "Come out now, or I'll kill her!"

The blade pierced the silk nightgown, drawing a drop of crimson.
###Chapter 46: Andrew, Just Kill Me!

Susan Thompson's knife trembled slightly as its tip pressed against Nicole Capra's chest.

She never wanted it to come to this.

Nicole's eyelashes fluttered. A calculated glint flashed through her eyes. She could have dodged, but deliberately leaned into the blade.

"Sister, have you gone mad?" Nicole's voice quivered, but when she met Susan's gaze, the corners of her lips curled into an almost imperceptible smirk.

Susan's grip on the knife tightened.

Andrew Lucas's footsteps echoed from the staircase, each step pounding against Susan's heart.

"Susan, let go." His voice was colder than the winter outside.

The blade left a red mark on Nicole's pale skin, drawing beads of blood.

"One million," Susan stared straight into Andrew's eyes, "or I'll kill her right now."

Nicole suddenly convulsed violently, tears streaming like broken pearls. "Andrew, save me... She hates me—"

"Shut up!" Susan snapped. "Nicole, haven't you acted enough?"

Andrew's expression darkened instantly. He strode forward and kicked the knife from Susan's hand.

The blade grazed Susan's wrist, blood dripping onto the expensive carpet.

Susan stared blankly at her own blood, then suddenly laughed.

That smile made Andrew's chest tighten.

"Andrew..." Susan's voice was barely a whisper. "I'll give you my life. Just save Daniel, please."

A sharp pain shot through her stomach. Cold sweat drenched her back. Trembling fingers fumbled for a pill bottle, shaking out several white tablets.

Andrew's gaze fixed on the bottle, his brow furrowing.

"More acting?" He sneered. "Susan, your life is worthless."

The housekeeper and servants dragged Susan out roughly, throwing her into the snow.

Curled up in the snow, blood trickled continuously from Susan's lips, staining the white ground beneath her.

She struggled to stand, swaying unsteadily forward. Each step felt like walking on knives.

Nicole's flirtatious laughter and Andrew's deep responses carried from the distance.

Susan finally collapsed to her knees in the snow, tears mixing with blood.

"Daniel... What should Mommy do...?"

Inside the villa, Andrew stood by the window, his gaze fixed on the staggering figure in the snow.

Nicole wrapped her arms around him from behind, her red lips brushing his ear. "Andrew, let me stay tonight, okay?"

Andrew didn't answer.

All he could see were Susan's desperate eyes.
###Chapter 47: Andrew, I Want to Be Your Woman!

The night was ink-black, but the villa blazed with light. Nicole Capra stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, her silk nightgown clinging to her curves. She studied her reflection, crimson lips curving into a smirk.

What woman wouldn’t want a man like Andrew Lucas? Tonight, she would make him hers.

"Andrew..." She turned, her voice dripping with honey.

He stood at the stairwell, his black shirt accentuating his cold elegance. His brow furrowed. "Why aren’t you asleep?"

She glided closer, fingertips brushing his collar. "I wanted to keep you company."

Andrew stepped back and pressed the intercom. "Escort Miss Capra home."

A flash of fury crossed her eyes. She lunged, wrapping her arms around him from behind. "Andrew, I’m your fiancée! We’re supposed to—"

"Enough." He pried her hands away and draped his jacket over her shoulders. "Don’t make me repeat myself."

As he walked upstairs, Nicole dug her nails into her palms. When the butler approached, she forced a demure smile. "Thank you."

Susan Thompson curled on the couch, staring at her phone. Only thirty-six hours remained before the kidnappers’ deadline.

One million. The number crushed her like a mountain.

She thought of Vincent King. If only he were still the man he’d once been... Susan laughed bitterly. The most useless word in the world was "if."

A knock startled her. Bella Quinn rushed in, chilled from the wind, and pulled a cloth bundle from her coat. "Take this."

Two stacks of cash, still warm from her body heat. Susan’s eyes burned. "Bella..."

"Don’t worry. I’ll find more." Bella squeezed her icy hands. "Daniel will pull through."

Susan opened her mouth but stopped. She couldn’t mention the kidnapping. She couldn’t drag her friend into danger again.

"The surgery money... it’s covered." She forced a smile. "A kind stranger helped..."

Bella grabbed her wrist. "You’re lying!" Her gaze locked onto Susan’s pale face. "What’s really going on?"

Before Susan could answer, she spotted bruises beneath Bella’s sleeve. She yanked it up—jagged scars crisscrossed her skin.

"Simon Finch did this?" Susan’s voice shook.

Bella jerked her arm back. "I fell. I have to go." She bolted for the door.

Susan chased her downstairs just in time to see a woman yank Bella’s hair. "Slut! Sneaking out to meet men at night!"

"I wasn’t—" Bella shielded her stomach.

The woman raised a wooden rod. "I’ll beat the shame out of you!"

The rod whistled through the air, aimed straight for Bella’s abdomen—
###Chapter 48: Susan Sells Herself

The moment Helen Finch's palm came whistling through the air, Susan Thompson's pupils constricted violently.

She had never imagined Simon's mother could be this vicious. The broom swung toward Bella Quinn's swollen belly with a whoosh, and Susan threw herself forward without hesitation.

A dull thud. Fire seared across Susan's back.

"Susan!" Bella's voice trembled as she reached shaking fingers toward Susan's spine. "Are you okay?"

"I'm fine." Susan forced a smile through gritted teeth.

Helen planted her hands on her hips, chin jutting like a rooster's. "Stop faking! I'm disciplining my own daughter-in-law. Who asked you to interfere?"

Susan shielded Bella behind her. "She came to see me! What right do you have to hit her?"

"Ha!" Helen spat. "This slut cheated on her husband. I'll beat her whenever I want!"

Bella's fingers were ice-cold. She gently pushed Susan away. "I have to go back."

Susan gripped her wrist. "No!"

"Grandma is in their hands." Bella's voice was feather-light. "Susan, I have to go."

Watching Bella follow Helen into the distance, Susan dug her nails deep into her palms. She finally understood—in this city, those without money or power couldn't even protect themselves.

The neon lights of Elegant Art glared harshly against the night sky.

Susan stood before the mirror, staring at her pale reflection. Even sickly and exhausted, her beauty remained breathtaking.

"Miss, you're the most stunning woman I've ever seen," the makeup artist marveled. "You'll fetch a sky-high price tonight."

Susan's lips twisted. She remembered what that extra had said—Elegant Art's auctions sold dances on the surface, but what they really sold were women.

The stench of hospital disinfectant still clung to her nostrils. That minor procedure had left her sweating in pain, but it was necessary. The wealthy liked their purchases "clean," so she'd give them a "pure" Susan Thompson.

"Miss Thompson, you're on."

Susan took a deep breath and stepped onto the stage in her stilettos. The spotlight hit her, and the audience gasped in unison.

Her gaze swept over the sea of greedy eyes—then locked onto a familiar figure in the shadows.

Andrew Lucas.

What was he doing here?

Her heart skipped a beat before she laughed bitterly. Perfect. Let him witness firsthand how the "promiscuous" Susan Thompson sold herself.

"Starting bid—one million!"

"Two million!"
"Five million!"
"Ten million!"

The numbers climbed, but Susan only heard white noise. Then Andrew stood, raising his paddle.

"Fifty million."

The room erupted.

Susan's fingers began trembling. She'd imagined countless scenarios—except this one.

"Sold!" The auctioneer's gavel struck. "Congratulations, Mr. Lucas!"

Susan stood frozen, feeling herself shatter piece by piece. Now she understood the meaning of "hoist with one's own petard"—she'd delivered herself into the hands of the man who despised her most.

Andrew ascended the stage, his gaze fathomless.

"Susan," he gripped her chin, "you disgust me."
###Chapter 49: His Gaze Lingered on Her

The familiar figure vanished in the bustling crowd.

Susan Thompson curled her lips in self-mockery. Andrew Lucas should be wrapped up in sweet moments with Nicole Capra right now. Why would he be here?

Perhaps it was for the best. She didn’t want him to witness her at her most vulnerable.

In the dressing room, the makeup artist’s fingers glided over her face, punctuated by occasional gasps of awe. Susan kept her eyes closed, listening to the endless stream of compliments.

"You’re the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen," the makeup artist murmured, her voice tinged with regret. "It’s just… such a shame…"

Susan understood the unspoken words. She opened her eyes. The reflection in the mirror was breathtaking—yet she was about to become a commodity for sale.

The manager brought in an exquisite gown with flowing sleeves, its waist adorned with rubies that shimmered under the lights. The gemstones on her forehead ornament, necklace, and anklet were all genuine, making her look like a celestial being descended to earth.

The auction results for the first five girls had been announced. The highest bid was five million, won by a foreign tycoon in his seventies. Susan watched the girl in the ballroom forcing a smile, bitterness welling in her chest.

A sheer veil covered her face, leaving only her mesmerizing eyes visible. With one glance, the crowd below erupted in excitement.

"Stunning!" Torey Smith clapped Andrew on the shoulder. "Andrew, is this what they call an Eastern beauty?"

Andrew didn’t even lift his head, his brows furrowed with impatience. He despised these events. If not for his friend’s insistence, he wouldn’t have set foot here.

The music began. Susan raised her sleeves, each graceful turn radiating breathtaking beauty. The room fell silent as her slender waist swayed.

Torey was spellbound, beads of sweat forming on his nose. "Andrew, how does that Chinese poem go? 'Graceful as a startled swan'—"

Andrew finally looked up.

The moment his gaze landed on the stage, his pupils constricted.

That woman on stage—it was unmistakably… Susan.
###Chapter 50: Andrew Lucas's Frenzied Bidding

The stage lights dimmed abruptly.

A single spotlight focused precisely on the slender figure at the center.

Susan Thompson turned slowly in her white tulle dress. The skirt fluttered lightly with her movement, like a blooming night-blooming cereus.

Gasps rippled through the audience.

"My God..."

"Is she real?"

"Unbelievably beautiful..."

Andrew Lucas's pupils constricted sharply.

His grip on the crystal glass turned his knuckles white. The glass cracked under the pressure.

"Andrew!" Torey Smith clapped his shoulder excitedly. "This is the goddess I told you about! Stunning, isn't she?"

Andrew's Adam's apple bobbed.

He knew exactly how beautiful she was.

Four years ago, on that rainy night, she had danced for him one last time in that same white dress.

"I've decided!" Torey waved his bidding paddle eagerly. "I'm taking her home tonight!"

The auctioneer struck the gavel.

"Starting bid at one million. Increments of one hundred thousand."

"Two million!" A bald man in the front row raised his paddle immediately.

"Three million!"

"Five million!"

The price skyrocketed at an alarming rate.

Torey raised his paddle defiantly. "Ten million!"

The room fell silent for a second.

Susan's gaze drifted toward the voice. When she recognized the man beside Torey, her face paled.

Andrew Lucas.

What was he doing here?

Her nails dug into her palms, but she felt no pain. Her most humiliating moment had been witnessed by him.

"Eleven million!"

"Twelve million!"

The bidding continued.

Torey leaned toward Andrew. "Andrew, I might be short on cash. Can you—"

"Forty million." Andrew raised his paddle abruptly.

The crowd erupted in murmurs.

Torey gaped at his friend. "Andrew, you—"

"Fifty million!" The bald man ground his teeth.

Andrew smirked coldly. "Eighty million."

The number silenced the entire room.

Susan stared at Andrew in disbelief. His eyes were terrifyingly icy, yet his lips curled into a cruel smile.

He was punishing her.

"Eighty million, going once!"

"Eighty million, going twice!"

The bald man wiped sweat from his forehead and raised his paddle with trembling hands. "Eighty-five million!"

"One hundred million."

Andrew's voice was quiet but struck like a hammer.

The auctioneer's gavel slammed down.

"Sold!"

Torey shot to his feet. "Andrew! What the hell?"

Andrew adjusted his cufflinks leisurely, his gaze locked onto Susan.

"Exactly what it means." His lips curved. "This woman is mine."
###Chapter 51: Andrew, We Can't Go Back

One hundred million.

The auction hammer fell with a resounding thud, plunging the room into stunned silence.

Andrew Lucas tapped the armrest with his slender fingers, his cold gaze sweeping across the crowd. The balding man in the front row hesitated, then lowered his bidding paddle after recognizing him.

No one dared to challenge the third son of the Lucas family.

"Andrew!" Torey Smith shot to his feet, his blond hair disheveled. "You can't do this! I saw the Goddess first!"

Andrew didn't even glance his way.

"Doesn't your country value first come, first served?" Torey persisted, stepping closer. "Andrew, we're brothers!"

"Looking for a fight?" Andrew finally met his eyes, a dangerous smirk playing on his lips.

Torey immediately shut his mouth. The memory of his two-week recovery from their last encounter was still fresh.

"One hundred million, going once!"

"One hundred million, going twice!"

"Sold!"

Susan Thompson stood on the stage, her nails digging into her palms. She never imagined Andrew would be the one to buy her.

The man who once promised to protect her forever.

The manager eagerly pushed her forward. "Mr. Lucas, everything is prepared upstairs."

Andrew seized her wrist with bone-crushing force.

"Mr. Lucas, we should dance first—" Before she could finish, he swept her off her feet.

"Stop pretending," he sneered. "Coming to a place like this—you were just waiting to be sold to the highest bidder."

The hotel room door slammed open.

A contract hit Susan in the face.

"Sign it."

The terms were clear: lifetime mistress, available at his beck and call. Breach of contract would cost her one billion.

Her hands trembled as she signed. How ironic—from Mrs. Lucas to a shameful secret, her life had become a cruel joke.

"Kneel."

Susan's head snapped up, meeting his icy stare.

"Clause Three." He leisurely undid his cufflinks. "The buyer has the right to demand any form of service."

Tears welled in her eyes as she bit her lip.

This one act would sever everything.

Andrew, we lost our way long ago.
###Chapter 52: Susan Thompson, Nothing's More Disgusting Than Your Fake Innocence!

Her knees slammed against the hardwood floor. Susan trembled violently as she knelt. The sound of fabric tearing pierced the silent room like her soul being shredded to pieces.

Each fragment carried barbs that embedded deep into her heart.

At dawn's first light, Andrew Lucas finally released her.

He stood by the bed adjusting his cufflinks, the black suit accentuating his broad shoulders and long legs like an untouchable deity. Meanwhile, she curled up in the disheveled sheets, resembling a crushed butterfly.

"Reconstructive surgery?" Andrew suddenly sneered, his slender fingers gripping her chin. "Susan, your act of playing innocent has reached perfection."

She kept her eyes closed, lashes casting shadows across her pale face.

No explanations would come.

Last night's procedure had indeed been for the auction. To save Daniel, she'd do anything.

"Speak!" Andrew's hand closed around her throat.

"What would Mr. Lucas like to hear?" Susan opened eyes that once sparkled but now held only emptiness. "That I'd stoop to anything for money? You're right. That's exactly who I am."

His knuckles cracked ominously.

Dark fury swirled in Andrew's gaze. "That night when you were eighteen - was that faked too?"

The words stabbed like a blade twisting in her chest.

Her entire body shook as blood welled from her bitten lip.

The night she'd joyfully given everything now reduced to a calculated deception in his eyes.

"Susan," Andrew released her, voice colder than ice. "The greatest regret of my life was touching you."

The door slammed shut with enough force to rattle the walls.

Clutching herself, Susan dug nails into her arms. Just endure a little longer. The ransom money would save Daniel, she repeated silently.

The bank notification chimed as she struggled into ill-fitting borrowed clothes. Ten million - enough for the ransom.

At South Mountain's cliff edge, the kidnapper leader yanked her forward. "Where's the card?"

"I need to see Daniel first!"

The man grinned cruelly, pulling out his phone. "Should I have them execute him now?"

Hands trembling, Susan surrendered the bank card.

The minivan jolted up the mountain road. When the cliffside scene came into view, she froze in horror—

Andrew Lucas and Nicole Capra stood waiting.
###Chapter 53: Life or Death

The icy mountain wind howled, tangling Susan Thompson's hair. Her nails dug deep into her palms as she stared at the two figures near the cliff's edge.

Nicole Capra was held at the precipice by the kidnappers, her flawless makeup streaked with tears. On the other side, little Daniel Almond swayed dangerously in the wind.

"Mommy!" Daniel's voice rang out, clear as a wind chime.

Susan's tears fell instantly. Her son looked thinner, his face frighteningly pale—but his eyes still shone bright.

"Don't be scared, Daniel." Susan forced a smile. "Mommy's here."

The kidnapper leader smirked at Andrew Lucas. "Andrew, choose. Save your little lover or this bastard?"

"He's not a bastard!" Susan's voice cracked as she looked up. "Andrew, Daniel is your son!"

Andrew's brow twitched almost imperceptibly. His gaze locked onto Daniel—the boy's lips pressed tight, his eyes piercingly clear.

"One!" The kidnapper began counting.

Nicole suddenly thrashed. "Andrew, save Daniel! I'd rather die than see you suffer!" Blood seeped from her rope-burned wrists as she struggled toward the edge.

"Two!"

Susan threw herself at Andrew's feet, her forehead striking sharp rocks. "Please, save Daniel! I'll do anything!"

Blood trickled down her face, blooming crimson on the ground.

Andrew's fists turned white. He remembered Susan last night at the auction—dancing in that cheap red dress under mocking stares.

"Three!"

"Release Nicole." Andrew's voice was glacial.

Susan's world shattered. She lunged for the cliff. "Daniel!"

The kidnapper laughed as he let go. Daniel's small body plummeted like a leaf.

"No—!" Susan's scream tore through the sky.

At the last possible second, a dark figure flashed past. Andrew leaped off the cliff, catching Daniel midair.

"Hold on!" he growled, his other hand gripping a jutting rock.

Susan knelt at the edge, watching father and son dangle between life and death. Her tears mixed with blood, dripping onto Andrew's straining arm.

"Andrew..." She reached out, trembling. "Please... don't let go..."

The wind wailed like a lament for this cruel choice.
###Chapter 54: His Choice Doomed Her Forever

Andrew Lucas's gaze lingered briefly on Nicole Capra's tear-streaked face before settling on Daniel Almond.

The small figure trembled slightly in the cold wind.

A three-and-a-half-year-old child, who should have been carefree and joyful, stood heartbreakingly still.

Daniel's eyes remained fixed on Susan Thompson, filled with reluctance and longing.

Andrew's heart clenched. His hand instinctively reached out.

Then he froze mid-air.

"Andy, save Daniel!" Susan's forehead was bleeding from hitting the ground. "You'll regret this!"

Her plea stabbed through Andrew like a knife.

"Susan, Nicole can't be harmed."

Those words felt like a death sentence.

Susan went rigid. The light in her eyes dimmed.

She turned to the kidnapper, her voice hoarse. "Kill me! Take my life instead of his!"

"Your life is worthless," the kidnapper sneered.

"Mommy, don't cry." Daniel forced a smile, tears glistening in his eyes. "I like it when Mommy smiles."

Susan's tears hit the ground.

"Mommy should be happy every day." Daniel's voice grew fainter. "I don't want Daddy anymore. Mommy shouldn't want him either."

"Daniel!" Susan struggled desperately.

Daniel's final glance at Andrew held one word: "Unworthy."

The kidnapper shoved.

"No—!"

Susan lunged toward the cliff edge, grasping only air.

Swirling mist swallowed the small figure.

Blood and tears blurred her vision.

For a fleeting moment, she saw Andrew as a young man smiling at her.

"My dream is to be the best husband for Susan."

"I'll be the best father for Daniel."

Memories receded like the tide.

Reality pierced like ice.

Standing at the cliff's edge, Susan suddenly smiled.

The smile was breathtakingly beautiful yet hollow enough to chill the soul.

"Daniel, Mommy's coming."

She stepped forward.

The wind lifted her hair like a silent farewell.
###Chapter 55 Andrew, You're Disgusting!

Susan Thompson stood at the edge of the cliff, the mountain wind howling as it whipped at her clothes.

"Daniel is waiting for me," she murmured, her toes already hanging over the void.

"Susan!"

Andrew Lucas rushed forward and locked an arm around her waist. His steel-like grip trembled slightly.

"Let go!" Susan struggled violently. "Daniel said it's so cold down there..."

"I'll send people to search!" Andrew's voice was hoarse. "Don't do anything reckless!"

Susan suddenly laughed, the sound uglier than a sob. "Living is what's reckless."

She threw herself forward, but Andrew held her tight.

"Get away from me!"

When her struggles grew too fierce, Andrew simply scooped her into his arms. "I won't let you die."

"Nicole Capra saved me. I can't abandon her," he said quietly. "As long as you live, we can start over..."

The body in his arms went still.

Andrew looked down to find Susan unconscious. Blood streamed from her forehead and lips, staining his shirt crimson.

"Susan!"

He carried her to the car, completely forgetting Nicole's existence.

Halfway down the mountain, Susan woke.

To his surprise, she didn't fight. She only said calmly, "Take me to Willow Lane."

"Susan, Daniel—"

"Don't say his name." Her eyes were hollow. "He'd find it filthy."

Andrew's chest constricted. In silence, he pressed the accelerator.

At Willow Lane, Susan blocked the doorway.

"Mr. Lucas, please leave." Her voice was eerily steady. "I remember the agreement. That hundred million won't go to waste."

The moment the door closed, Susan slid to the floor.

Her fingers dug into her palms. How could Daniel survive such a high cliff?

Not even his body could be found...

Susan curled into herself, trembling soundlessly. Her Daniel—her little sun who used to warm her hands—was gone.

Fate was always this cruel. She'd finally scraped together the surgery funds, only for them to become useless forever.

She clutched Daniel's photo to her chest as if it were her only oxygen.

Outside, the distant sound of helicopters echoed. Andrew had sent search teams to the base of the cliff.

The next morning, the doorbell rang.

Nicole Capra stood there, wearing an unreadable smile.
###Chapter 56: No Remains Left!

Bella Quinn couldn't bear leaving Susan Thompson alone. She wanted to take leave to stay with her. But early in the morning, Grandma Thompson blocked Willow Lane's entrance, shouting and dragging her to work.

Susan curled up in Daniel's room. The wound on her forehead had scabbed, yet she still wore the bloodstained clothes. Like a walking corpse, she even forgot to close the door.

Nicole Capra entered gracefully in high heels, carrying an exquisite sandalwood box. Seeing Susan's state, a flicker of satisfaction crossed her eyes.

"Dear sister, how did you end up like this?" Nicole feigned concern with a sigh. "Andrew and I are so worried about you."

"Get out." Susan's voice was hoarse.

Instead of leaving, Nicole extended the box. "I came to bring Daniel home."

Susan snatched it, shocked by its unnatural lightness. This box couldn't possibly hold a child!

"Don't panic," Nicole's red lips curved. "This does contain Daniel, but..."

She slowly opened the box, revealing bloodied fabric scraps—Daniel's clothes from his fall.

Susan trembled violently. Her fingers spasmed, unable to grasp the fabric.

"Know why only these remain?" Nicole whispered like a venomous snake. "Wild beasts tore him apart. Andrew thought this would be easier for you."

Susan stood frozen, as if struck by lightning.

"Those beasts..." Nicole narrowed her eyes. "Did they snap his neck first? Or eat him limb by limb?"

"Ah—!" Susan hurled a teacup at her.

It shattered at Nicole's feet, glass shards flying.

"Invite me to the funeral," Nicole stroked the box's edge. "After all, he called me auntie."

Susan smashed a chair against Nicole's back. Nicole winced but smiled brighter. Satisfied, she left, heels clicking sharply on the wooden floor.

Alone, Susan clutched the box desperately. She pressed the bloodied fabric to her face, imagining Daniel's scent still lingered.

"Daniel... Mommy's sweet Daniel..."

The funeral was simple. Susan reserved a plot beside Daniel's grave. Back at Willow Lane, she began sorting his belongings.

Inside a black velvet box, she discovered...
###Chapter 57: The Lost Wish

The box was heavier than expected. Susan's fingers trembled as she lifted the lid, revealing a yellowed notebook nestled inside.

On the title page, crooked handwriting spelled out "For Mom." The ink had bled in places, as if soaked by tears.

"Mom, the doctor says I'm going to die soon," the first page began. "But I'm not scared. I just don’t want to leave you."

Susan's nails dug into her palms. The edges of the notebook were frayed, clearly turned countless times.

"You always called me your little sun," the childish scrawl continued. "But even the sun has to set. When I become a star, Mom, remember to look up at me."

The rustling of pages echoed sharply in the empty apartment.

"Yesterday, Nurse Auntie cried secretly. Don’t be like her, Mom. Daniel loves seeing you smile." Pinyin and characters mixed together, with simple doodles replacing words he couldn’t write. A lopsided smiley face was labeled "Mom’s smile."

Tucked in the middle was a photo. Three-year-old Daniel, in a hospital gown, flashed a peace sign at the camera. Behind him stretched the sterile white walls of the hospital.

"Uncle Murphy taught me to read!" another page suddenly declared. "He said Mom works too hard, so I need to grow up fast to protect you."

Susan’s vision blurred. On the back of the photo, a pencil had scribbled a date—the last day Vincent had visited them.

"Mom, don’t forgive that bad man." The pen strokes dug deep, nearly tearing the page. "He made you cry. Daniel is so angry. In my next life, I’ll grow taller than him and punch him into the sky!"

The last few pages grew erratic, sentences trailing off unfinished. The final entry held only half a phrase: "Mom, be hap—"

Susan snapped the notebook shut. Inside the back cover, a sticky note clung to the surface, bearing crooked musical notes on a staff. Beside it read: "Uncle Murphy’s 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.'"

A thunderclap cracked outside. Susan grabbed her coat and rushed out, only to collide with Andrew in the hallway, drenched from the rain.

He clutched a velvet box, his knuckles white. "Susan—"

She brushed past him without a word.

Rain dripped from her chin onto the notebook. In the backseat of the taxi, she noticed faint pencil marks on the last page—smudged by tears: "If Uncle Murphy becomes a bad man too, Mom, just ignore him. Daniel will be a real star and protect you."

The glass facade of King Corporation twisted in the downpour. As the elevator numbers climbed, Susan’s fingers brushed the faint mark on her ring finger—where a soda can tab "ring" from Vincent had once rested.

"Floor 58," chimed the automated voice.

At the end of the hall, Vincent stood in his crisp suit, speaking to his secretary. The man who once knelt on the floor building blocks with Daniel was now unrecognizable.

Susan froze. The notebook in her arms burned like it held the sun of an entire summer.
###Chapter 58: He Crushed All Her Hopes

Susan Thompson stood before the King Group headquarters, the icy wind cutting through her.

The familiar Lamborghini slowly approached, making her heart clench violently.

"Vincent!"

She waved frantically, her voice hoarse and broken.

The car window rolled down, revealing the face that haunted her dreams.

"Daniel, he—"

Tears blurred her vision before she could finish.

Vincent King's gaze was colder than ice.

"Get lost."

Trembling, Susan pulled a photo from her bag. "Look, this is Daniel—"

The photo was snatched from her hands.

In the next second, it was torn to pieces, fluttering down like snow.

Susan dropped to her knees, desperately trying to catch the falling fragments.

"No—"

Her fingers bled from the sharp edges, but she didn't even notice.

"Vincent, Daniel's last wish—"

"Shut up!"

The engine roared as the car sped past, its wheels grazing the hem of her coat.

A security guard roughly yanked her away. "Stop making a scene here!"

Susan collapsed into the snow.

A child's voice singing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star drifted from the distance, making her curl into herself.

By the time she returned to Willow Lane, she coughed up blood.

The gilded invitation on her bedside table gleamed coldly under the moonlight.

Three days later, the Golden Splendor Hotel was ablaze with lights.

Susan tightened her coat, scanning the crowd for that familiar figure.

At the corner, she suddenly froze.

"Is it done?"

Nicole Capra's voice came from the shadows.

"Relax. That little bastard will never speak again."

The man's words turned Susan's blood to ice.

She clamped a hand over her mouth, nails digging into her palm.

So Daniel's death...

Was no accident!
###Chapter 59: The Blood-Red Invitation

The sharp click of high heels echoed down the corridor, mingled with hushed, intimate gasps. Susan Thompson froze mid-step—she'd recognize that voice anywhere. Nicole Capra.

"Stop... someone might see us..." Nicole's tone dripped with deliberately subdued allure.

Susan clenched her handbag tighter. She had no interest in discovering which man Nicole was entangled with this time. Finding Vincent King was her priority.

"Nicole, I lost over a dozen men for you!" The rough male voice sent a tremor through Susan. The kidnapper leader.

She ducked behind a corner, nails digging into her palms. So the kidnapping had been Nicole's scheme all along—to force Andrew Lucas to abandon Daniel.

Her phone screen flickered briefly before dying. No battery. Susan bit her lip. These past days had left her too drained to even charge it.

"Louis Lynch, have you lost your mind? This is a charity gala!" Nicole's voice turned shrill. "I'll transfer the money. Don't contact me again!"

"Kicking the ladder away after climbing up?" Louis sneered. "Should I tell Mr. Lucas who ordered me to kidnap that little bastard?"

The air turned glacial. Susan's heartbeat pounded in her ears.

"Louis..." Nicole's tone instantly softened. "I panicked earlier. Tomorrow night, our usual spot?"

The sound of fabric rustling and nauseating kisses followed. Susan's stomach churned. As she retreated silently, her elbow knocked over a vase.

"Who's there?" Nicole snapped.

Susan sprinted toward the ballroom without looking back. Harsh lights made her squint, her palms slick with sweat. Now she understood—Daniel's death was never an accident.

At the center of the ballroom, Andrew Lucas held court. His tailored black suit accentuated broad shoulders and a narrow waist, the collar fastened meticulously to the top. The man always resembled an unsheathed sword—razor-sharp yet forbiddingly distant.

Nicole had reappeared at his side, a flame in red silk. She clung to Andrew's arm, gliding forward under envious gazes.

"Sister." Nicole produced a gilded invitation from her bejeweled clutch. "You simply must attend our engagement party next month."

The crimson invitation resembled spilled blood. Susan noticed the unmasked wrinkles on Nicole's skirt—still bearing another man's fingerprints.
###Chapter 60: Wishing You a Lifetime of Happiness

The engraved invitation burned Susan Thompson's fingertips.

She thought her heart had turned to ashes long ago. Yet when the gilded card was placed before her, a dull ache spread through her chest.

"Sister, Andrew and I are getting engaged next month." Nicole Capra smiled sweetly, her eyes glinting with hidden challenge. "We'd love you to witness our happiness."

Susan stared at the two names printed side by side. Then she laughed.

"An engagement..." She took the invitation slowly, tracing the embossed letters with her fingertips. "Should I bring a gift?"

Nicole stiffened, clearly unprepared for the question. "Well—"

"But honestly," Susan tore the invitation in half, "I'd rather feed money to stray dogs than give it to cheating scum."

Shredded paper fluttered onto Nicole's perfectly made-up face.

Andrew's expression turned icy. He grabbed Susan's wrist. "Susan!"

"Why so tense, Mr. Lucas?" She shook him off, smiling brightly. "I'm just giving you my blessing."

She took a step back, voice ringing clear. "May the whore and the dog live happily ever after!"

As she turned away, something wet trailed down her cheek. Susan wiped it away, straightened her spine, and walked toward the buffet.

Behind her, Nicole's fake sobs mingled with Andrew's comforting murmurs. Susan smirked and picked up a champagne flute from a passing waiter.

A sharp pain stabbed through her stomach. She set the glass down, searching for painkillers.

"Looking for Mr. King?" A server whispered. "He just went to the east lounge on the second floor."

Susan thanked him and glanced toward the staircase. The pain worsened. She decided to eat something before taking medication.

Across the room, Nicole watched Susan's retreating figure. She pulled a small vial from her clutch.

"Take this to Mr. King's room." She handed the server a glass of spiked wine. "Tell him... it's from Miss Thompson."

The server pocketed the heavy tip and carried the tray upstairs.

Nicole sipped her champagne, malice flashing in her eyes.

Tonight's show would be unforgettable.
###Chapter 61 Shameless Susan!

Painkillers should never be taken on an empty stomach.

Susan swallowed a few pieces of soft pastry and drank half a bowl of hot soup before her stomach finally settled.

She took a moment to compose herself before picking up her handbag and heading upstairs.

The so-called lounge was nothing more than a luxury suite on the top floor of the hotel. Susan knew which room Vincent was in, but she wasn’t sure if she could enter.

Would the man who despised her even open the door?

She spent the entire walk rehearsing excuses, only to freeze when she reached the doorway—it was slightly ajar.

Susan knocked lightly before stepping inside cautiously.

"Vincent..."

Before she could finish, a tall figure loomed over her. Vincent stood before her, his once-starry eyes now filled with nothing but icy disdain.

Suppressing the ache in her heart, Susan forced a smile. "I need to talk to you about something important. Just a few minutes?"

Vincent stared at her in silence, his gaze unreadable.

Taking his silence as permission, Susan pulled Daniel’s notebook from her bag and flipped to the page covered in stars.

"This was Daniel’s last wish. He wanted to hear you sing 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' one more time."

"I know it’s an unreasonable request. But if you remember…" Her voice trembled slightly. "During those four years in the dungeon, you sang it to him every night."

"Dungeon?" Vincent cut her off sharply. "What dungeon?"

"We were locked in a dungeon together for four years. Daniel was my child with Andrew. After he was born, we relied on each other to survive." Susan spoke urgently. "You taught him to read, sang to him… Do you really not remember any of it?"

"Pathetic." Vincent scoffed. "You’d stoop to making up such lies just to get close to me?"

"I did have four years of blurred memories, but that was from recovering in a sanatorium. Candy was the one who stayed by my side!" His voice rose suddenly. "There was no dungeon, no you, and certainly no child!"

Susan stared at him in shock. So it wasn’t amnesia—he’d been hypnotized?

The thought that Henry might have tampered with Vincent’s mind again sent a chill down her spine.

A sharp pain shot through her shoulder as Vincent’s fingers dug into her flesh.

"Susan, I’ve met plenty of women like you—willing to do anything to get what they want." His voice was frigid. "But the only woman I want is Candy."

"You’ve got it all wrong!" Susan hurried to explain. "I don’t have those kinds of feelings for you!"

"I just…" Her voice cracked. "Daniel suffered so much when he died. Thrown off a cliff, torn apart by wild animals…"

Tears blurred her vision. She turned her face away. "Maybe it’s better you don’t remember. At least you won’t grieve for us."

Vincent’s grip tightened unconsciously. He despised this persistent woman, yet hearing her claim she felt nothing for him stirred an inexplicable irritation.

"Still acting?" His voice was rough.

Suddenly, a wave of heat surged through him. Vincent immediately realized he’d been drugged.

That glass of red wine earlier—the server had said it was sent by "Miss Thompson." He’d assumed it was Candy, but it was this woman instead!

"You’d even resort to this to get into my bed?" He threw Susan to the ground and pinned her beneath him.

"Since you have no shame, I’ll give you exactly what you want."
###Chapter 62: Filthy Scheme

Vincent King's gaze was wrong.

Susan Thompson felt a chill run down her spine. She instantly realized he'd been drugged. Clenching her fists, her nails dug deep into her palms. This was clearly a trap—and she was the prey.

Slap!

The sharp sound of a slap echoed through the room.

"Vincent, snap out of it!" Susan barked.

Vincent shook his head, a flicker of clarity flashing in his eyes before being replaced by deeper disgust. He shoved her away roughly, his voice dripping with scorn. "Stop pretending. Wasn't this your plan all along?"

"You're insane!" Susan staggered to her feet. "We've been set up!"

She reached for her clutch, only to find her phone dead. Cold sweat trickled down her back. She had to get out of this room—now. If the "witnesses" arrived, everything would be ruined.

But before she could touch the doorknob, a brutal force yanked her back.

"Playing hard to get?" Vincent sneered, his eyes bloodshot. "Disgusting."

Susan crashed onto the floor, pain exploding behind her eyes. She fought desperately, but his strength overpowered her. Despair surged like a tide as she heard the sickening rip of fabric.

Meanwhile, in the banquet hall...

Nicole Capra hurried toward Andrew Lucas, who had just ended a call. Her face was the picture of distress. "Andrew, something terrible happened!"

"Hmm?" He pocketed his phone indifferently.

"It's Susan..." Nicole hesitated dramatically. "Someone saw her upstairs with Vincent..."

Before she could finish, Andrew was already sprinting away. Nicole watched his frantic retreat, a cold smirk curling her lips. Her meticulously laid trap was about to spring.

BANG!

The door burst open with violent force.

Andrew's vision turned red at the sight of the tangled figures on the bed. His fist collided with Vincent's face. The two men crashed into each other, the brutal sound of flesh striking flesh filling the room.

Susan struggled to stand, her clothes disheveled. Instinct made her step forward to intervene—until she saw the blood at Andrew's mouth. Her body locked in place. A sharp pain pierced her heart as she gave a bitter, self-mocking smile.

That tiny expression ignited Andrew's fury.

She was smiling?

Panicked for Vincent, but smiling at his pain? His strikes grew more vicious, each one aimed to kill.

"Stop!" Nicole rushed in, feigning distress as she grabbed Andrew's arm. "This must be a misunderstanding!"

She turned to shield Susan, her voice trembling with fake tears. "Vincent, how could you do this to her?"

In the shadows, Nicole's nails dug into her palms. Though the plan had deviated slightly, it was enough. By dawn, Susan would be branded a harlot—despised by the two men who mattered most.
###Chapter 63: Susan, I Believe You!

Nicole Capra's words trailed off, but everyone in the room understood her insinuation.

As expected, Vincent King responded with a cold sneer.

"Hah!"

His sharp gaze raked over Susan Thompson's face like a blade. "I took advantage of her? If she hadn't drugged me and shamelessly thrown herself at me, would I have touched her? Vincent King isn't that desperate!"

Susan didn't immediately defend herself.

She stared dazedly at Vincent's face, once gentle as jade but now frosted with hostility. This was how he was supposed to look at her. Those four years of mutual dependence now seemed like an absurd dream.

"Susan!"

Andrew Lucas's gritted voice snapped her back to reality.

"I didn't drug Vincent," Susan said calmly. "I was framed. I came to him only for Daniel."

"Framed?" Vincent's lips curled mockingly. "Miss Thompson, dare you say you didn't enter my room willingly tonight?"

"Dare you deny repeatedly seducing me in the King Corporation's underground garage? Dare you deny nearly killing Candy while trying to climb into my bed?"

"It wasn't me!" Susan's voice trembled. She had been to the garage but never with such vile intentions. Candy's injury was entirely Nicole's orchestrated drama.

"Susan, have you no shame!" Andrew suddenly grabbed her throat. "Can't you live without men?!"

His fist smashed into the wall with a reverberating thud.

Choking but defiant, Susan lifted her chin. "Yes, Mr. Lucas, I can't live without men. But that's my business. What's it to you?"

"Susan!"

"My mind is perfectly clear—no need to keep reminding me of my name!" She pried Andrew's hand away and turned to Vincent, her eyes reddening.

"Vincent, I know you don't believe me." Her voice cracked. "But all three times I sought you out were for Daniel. First to borrow money for his surgery, then to fulfill his dying wishes."

"I swear upon Daniel's spirit—if I ever harbored improper thoughts about you, may lightning strike me and my soul scatter!"

Vincent's pupils constricted.

He should despise this shameless woman, yet her desperate oath inexplicably filled him with panic and piercing pain—so intense it overshadowed the drugs in his system.

"If you truly had no ulterior motives," he heard himself demand uncontrollably, "why did you kidnap Candy?"

Susan searched his eyes deeply.

How could the once-perceptive Vincent be so blinded by a woman like Candy?

"Nothing to say?" Vincent sneered.

"Indeed, nothing." Susan smiled bleakly. "Because no matter what I say, none of you will believe me. But I'll say this—Susan Thompson has a clear conscience!"

"Your belief means nothing now."

As she turned to leave, a clear voice sounded at the door:

"I believe you!"

Susan looked up to see Ethan Sullivan, dusty from travel, standing at the threshold. Though weary, his eyes shone with familiar warmth.

Striding forward, he clasped her icy hand. "Susan, I believe you."

"Ethan..."

Tears suddenly overflowed.

She thought she'd cried herself dry, yet before this young man, she could still weep like a wronged girl.

"I'm back."

Ignoring the room's hostile stares, Ethan pulled her into a firm embrace.
###Chapter 64: The Truth Revealed! Nicole's Scheme

Susan's fingertips trembled slightly.

She looked at Ethan Sullivan, who had suddenly appeared at the doorway, and her eyes instantly reddened.

"Ethan..."

She threw herself into his arms, clinging to him like a lifeline. The familiar scent of him made her nose sting, and all her grievances lodged in her throat.

Andrew Lucas's gaze turned icy.

He stared at the embracing pair, his knuckles whitening from how tightly he clenched his fists. Vincent King's expression was equally grim, his lips curling into a mocking smirk.

A flicker of panic flashed in Nicole Capra's eyes.

But she quickly composed herself, forcing a gentle smile. "Ethan, you came just in time. Susan... might have just had a momentary lapse in judgment."

Her words pretended to defend Susan while subtly confirming her guilt.

Before Susan could refute, Ethan gently released her and clapped his hands.

A waitress in uniform stepped into the room.

Nicole's face drained of color.

"Surprised?" Ethan's smile was knowing. "I rushed here as soon as I landed, hearing Susan was at the gala. Then I overheard this waitress chatting in the hallway..."

He turned to the waitress. "Xiao Li, tell everyone—who asked you to deliver that drink?"

"It was Miss Nicole Capra!" Xiao Li answered without hesitation.

Nicole staggered back. "You're lying!"

She turned to Susan, tears welling in her eyes. "Susan, why would you frame me like this? Just because you failed to seduce Vincent doesn't mean you can pin the blame on me!"

Xiao Li's face flushed with anger.

"Miss Capra, I used to be your fan." She pulled out a thick stack of cash and threw it to the floor. "But now I'm ashamed I ever admired you! Take your money back!"

Nicole feigned composure. "I don't even know you. Susan, I won't hold it against you for hiring someone to slander me..."

She leaned weakly against Andrew. "Andrew, Susan is just heartbroken. Don't be angry with her..."

Xiao Li scoffed. "Miss Capra's acting is truly impeccable. But—" She pointed at the wineglass on the nightstand. "The fingerprints on this won't lie, will they?"

The room fell deathly silent.

Nicole's face turned ghostly pale.
###Chapter 65: He Couldn't Forget Her

Nicole's words struck Susan like a slap across the face.

Her lips trembled violently as her nails dug deep into her palms.

"Miss Thompson, consider this a declaration of war." Nicole smiled brightly. "If anything happens to me, I'll know it was you!"

A flash of malice crossed Susan's eyes, but she dared not act on it.

"Susan!" Ethan's voice cut through the air like ice, his boyish face stern. "Do we need to check the surveillance footage for you to admit it?"

Susan staggered back.

Suddenly, she dropped to her knees before Nicole, tears instantly welling up. "Sister, I was wrong..."

Andrew's pupils constricted sharply.

"Andrew..." Nicole clutched his sleeve, sobbing. "I was just so scared..."

Her tears splashed onto the carpet. "I've been by your side for four years, yet your heart still belongs to her..."

Andrew's entire body stiffened.

His gaze instinctively sought out Susan, only to find her lips curled in a mocking smile.

"It's not your fault." He pulled Nicole into his arms, but his eyes remained locked on Susan.

Susan let out a soft, derisive laugh.

How ironic.

She turned to leave, but Vincent blocked her path.

"Who said you could go?" His expression was terrifyingly dark.

Only now did he realize this woman had no intention of seducing him.

The realization left his chest uncomfortably tight.

"Did you need something, Mr. King?" Susan asked coldly.

Vincent's gaze fell on her hand entwined with Ethan's, his eyes turning stormy. "Fickle woman."

Ethan immediately stepped in front of Susan. "Watch your mouth!"

Andrew suddenly sneered. "Stop pretending to be virtuous."

He yanked Susan toward him. "What were you planning, sneaking into a man's room at night?"

"Andrew!" Nicole frantically grabbed his arm.

Susan shook off Andrew's grip, her eyes icy. "Since when do you care, Mr. Lucas?"

As she turned away, Vincent's furious voice followed her. "Susan Thompson, this isn't over."

The hallway lights stretched her shadow long and thin.

Ethan caught up and took her cold hand in his. "Ignore those lunatics."

Susan gazed out at the night beyond the window and gave a small nod.

She didn't see the two pairs of burning eyes still fixed on her retreating figure.
###Chapter 66: She Would Make Nicole Capra's Life a Living Hell!

Susan Thompson staggered as Nicole Capra suddenly clung to her leg.

Nicole's tears came on cue, soaking Susan's dress. "Sister, this is all my fault! I shouldn't have taken the liberty of setting you up... I just couldn't bear seeing you suffer after losing Daniel..."

"Let go." Susan's icy gaze bore into the drama queen.

"No! I'll kneel here until you forgive me!" Nicole tightened her grip, nails digging into Susan's flesh.

Susan stared at that hypocritical face, visions of Daniel's tragic death flashing before her eyes. She clenched her fists until her nails drew blood from her palms.

"Stop acting, Nicole."

"How could you think that of me?" Nicole raised her voice dramatically, drawing stares from nearby guests. "I'm sincerely apologizing!"

She made a show of kowtowing, only to be stopped by a shard of glass Ethan Sullivan kicked toward her.

"Kneel on this," Ethan sneered. "That would show real sincerity."

Nicole paled, casting a pleading look at Andrew Lucas.

Andrew yanked her up, his expression dark. "Know your limits, Ethan."

"Know my limits?" Ethan laughed bitterly. "Where was this energy when she bullied Susan?"

"My woman isn't yours to discipline." Andrew shielded Nicole behind him, enunciating each word. "Even if I marry Nicole, Susan will remain my mistress for life."

"Bullshit!" Ethan swung a punch.

Andrew wiped blood from his lip. "What else do you call a woman who sold herself at Elegant Art for 100 million?"

Susan's blood ran cold.

"Andrew!" Ethan roared.

"What?" Andrew's contemptuous gaze swept over Susan's ashen face. "She signed that contract herself."

Vincent King snorted and stormed out. The assistant hastily followed.

In the suffocating silence, Ethan's voice trembled. "Susan... is this true?"

She closed her eyes, nails biting deeper into her palms. "Yes. I sold myself... at Elegant Art."

Each word flayed her soul.

Andrew smirked at her shattered expression and left arm-in-arm with Nicole.

The AC hummed, yet Susan shivered uncontrollably. Hugging herself brought no warmth to her frozen heart.

Andrew... is this what you wanted?

To grind my last shred of dignity into dust.
###Chapter 67: Ethan, I'm Shameless

Susan bit her lip until she tasted blood.

She had sold herself, yet failed to save Daniel.

The metallic tang rose in her throat, but she swallowed it down. Lifting her gaze, she met Ethan Sullivan's eyes.

"That night, I auctioned myself for a hundred million," she whispered. "I received ten million."

"Ethan, thank you for your affection." Her smile was uglier than tears. "But I don't deserve it."

With those final words, her strength drained away.

She stood motionless, like a prisoner awaiting judgment.

Ethan's lips pressed into a thin line.

Susan suddenly remembered being caught by her foster father as a child. He'd called her shameless and slapped her.

She feared Ethan would do the same.

"Ethan, do you think I'm shameless?" she blurted. "I think so too—"

Before she could finish, she was pulled into a warm embrace.

His arms tightened around her.

"Susan, you'll always be the best girl in my heart," he murmured in her ear.

Her tears broke free.

She covered her mouth, but the sobs escaped anyway.

"Daniel's gone..." She buried her face in his chest. "I earned ten million, but I still couldn't save him..."

The dam of emotions burst.

"I called you..." Her voice hitched. "I tried everything... In the end, I had to go to Elegant Art..."

Ethan held her tighter.

He didn't think her dirty—only brokenhearted.

And he hated Andrew Lucas more than ever, for humiliating her instead of saving his own son.

But most of all, he hated himself.

Why had he gone abroad?

Had he stayed, she wouldn't have suffered, and Daniel might still be alive.

"I'm sorry, Susan." He stroked her back. "I won't leave you again."

Her crying intensified.

He hadn't rejected her. He'd apologized.

"Susan, what was Daniel's last wish?" Ethan gently pulled back to look at her.

Too choked up to speak, she handed him Daniel's notebook, opened to the final page.

Ethan studied the childish handwriting, picturing a little boy writing by the window.

His eyes burned, but he forced a smile. "Susan, I know 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' too."

"Let's go sing it for Daniel now."

That night, Ethan sang until his voice turned hoarse.

From dusk till dawn, he stubbornly repeated the lullaby.

Though no stars shone, Susan saw the night sky glittering.

Silently, she made a vow: Ethan, in our next life, I'll love you whole and healthy.

The next morning, Susan decided to start with the kidnapper leader, Louis Lynch.

She bought a new SIM card and dialed his number.

"Mr. Lynch, Miss Capra asked me to contact you," she said in a hushed tone.

"Nicole?" Louis snarled. "Tell her not to burn bridges!"

"She sent me to deliver money."

"Tell her to wait! I'm coming for her!" He hung up.

Susan grabbed her phone and rushed out.

Today, she would get evidence.
###Chapter 68: The Damning Recording

Susan Thompson hailed a taxi and rushed straight to Nicole Capra's villa.

Louis Lynch arrived before her. When Susan reached the property, the man in a baseball cap and face mask was loitering near the gates. Even fully concealed, she recognized him instantly—the murderer who had killed Daniel Almond. She could never mistake him, even if he were reduced to ashes.

Louis was furtively making a phone call. Susan hid behind the wall, clearly hearing his agitated voice: "Nicole Capra, don't push your luck! If you play games with me again, I’ll go straight to Andrew Lucas!"

After a tense silence, the villa gates finally opened. Nicole stepped out, her expression panicked. "Who told you to come here?" she hissed. "Get out of here!"

Susan quietly pulled out her phone. Unfortunately, Louis was too well-covered for a clear photo. She switched to audio recording instead.

"Trying to ditch me?" Louis sneered, stepping closer to Nicole. "Don’t forget, I still have those compromising videos of yours. Imagine if Andrew saw them—"

"Shut up!" Nicole’s face turned ghostly pale. "Delete those videos!"

"Threatening me?" Louis let out a sinister chuckle. "How did your grandmother die? And what about Daniel Almond? Those things—"

"Louis!" Nicole suddenly softened her tone. "Big Brother Louis, let’s talk this through. Just delete the videos, and I’ll give you whatever you want."

"Oh?" He smirked, tilting her chin up. "Then come keep me company tonight."

Nicole bit her lip and nodded. "Fine... After my engagement, I’ll spend three nights a week with you."

Susan clenched her phone tightly. This recording was irrefutable evidence! She tried to back it up to the cloud, but the signal was too weak.

Just then, a black Koenigsegg pulled up. Andrew Lucas stepped out with long strides. "Nicole, my second sister is back. Mom wants us for dinner."

As Nicole moved to greet him, a stray cat darted past Susan’s feet. "Meow—"

"Who’s there?" Nicole whirled around, her face draining of color. She lunged for Susan’s phone. "Sister! You can’t post those photos!"

Andrew frowned as he approached. "What’s going on?"

"Andrew!" Nicole burst into theatrical tears. "She took indecent photos of me and threatened to leak them online to ruin me!"

"Lies!" Susan raised her phone. "I recorded her conspiring with the kidnapper! They plotted Daniel’s murder together!"

As the recording played, Nicole’s face turned deathly pale.
###Chapter 69: Andrew Lucas, You Blind Fool!

"Sister, I'm begging you on my knees. Why won't you let me go?" Nicole Capra sobbed, her delicate shoulders trembling as if she had suffered unbearable injustice.

Susan Thompson watched her performance coldly, swiftly tapping to play the recording.

At first, there was only silence. Before Louis Lynch's voice could be heard, Andrew Lucas snatched the phone from her hands.

"Give it back!" Susan lunged for it but grasped nothing but air.

The phone arced through the air before smashing against the wall, shattering into pieces.

Susan stumbled forward, dropping to her knees as she frantically gathered the broken fragments. The screen had gone completely black, beyond repair.

Her last hope had been destroyed by Andrew's own hands.

"Andrew Lucas..." Susan slowly lifted her head, her eyes burning with fury. "Do you even know what you just destroyed?"

Andrew looked down at her, his handsome face icy. Before he could speak, Nicole clung to his arm.

"Andrew, I'm so scared..." She buried her face in his chest. "If those photos get out, how can I keep living?"

His expression darkened instantly. He seized Susan's chin, his grip so tight it threatened to crush bone.

"Susan Thompson, you're asking for death."

Susan suddenly laughed—a bitter, broken sound. With a sharp motion, she slapped him across the face.

Crack!

The sharp sound echoed through the hallway.

"Andrew Lucas, you're a blind fool!" Her voice was raw with rage. "You believe every word Nicole says, yet you can't even recognize the enemy who killed your own son!"

Andrew's eyes turned stormy, his entire body radiating menace. He grabbed her throat and slammed her against the wall.

"That bastard's death was my decision. Nicole had nothing to do with it." His voice was glacial as he leaned closer. "If you lay a finger on her again, I'll make Bella Quinn join him in the grave."

Susan's pupils dilated in horror.

"You wouldn't dare!"

"Try me." He released her, letting her collapse to the floor.

Her gaze landed on a loose brick nearby. In a flash, she grabbed it and lunged at Nicole.

"Die!"

Before she could throw it, Andrew kicked the brick from her hands. He stomped on her fingers, grinding his polished shoe into her skin.

"Ah!" Susan gasped, sweat beading on her forehead from the pain.

"Madwoman." Andrew sneered in disgust, turning to shield Nicole in his arms. "Don't be afraid. I'm here."

Susan lay on the ground, suddenly bursting into laughter—a chilling, hollow sound that sent shivers down the spine.

A handful of hundred-dollar bills rained down on her face.

"Susan, do something for me." Andrew's icy voice came from above.
###Chapter 70: Susan Humiliates Andrew Lucas!

Banknotes scattered across the floor like bloodstains.

Susan's fingers trembled as she fought the urge to throw the money back in Andrew's face. But thoughts of Bella Quinn forced her to bend down.

"Buy condoms and deliver them to Clearwater Bay." Andrew's voice was glacial. "Nicole can't get pregnant."

Susan's head snapped up, disbelief flashing in her eyes. He wanted her to purchase protection for him and Nicole?

"Having second thoughts about being a billion-dollar whore?" Andrew sneered. "Or do you want Bella to die sooner?"

Her teeth sank into her lower lip as she gathered the scattered bills.

"Fine, I'll buy them." Susan lifted her chin with mocking defiance. "I just never realized Mr. Lucas had such thick skin."

"With your pathetic size, you actually dare ask for condoms?" She deliberately raised her voice. "Make sure to get the smallest size—I'd be embarrassed otherwise!"

Andrew's face darkened instantly.

Susan turned on her heel, stilettoes clicking sharply. She knew he was lying, but any chance to humiliate him was worth taking.

Around the corner, she finally collapsed against the wall. Blood welled where her nails had dug into her palms, but the physical pain paled against the agony in her chest.

At the Clearwater Bay villa, Ethan Sullivan waited anxiously.

"Susan!" His expression twisted at the sight of her injured hand. "Who hurt you?"

"Just fell." She forced a weak smile. "What brings you here, Mr. Sullivan?"

Without explanation, Ethan pulled her toward his car. "I'm taking you somewhere."

As the car headed toward Clearwater Bay, Susan's pulse quickened. That was the last place she wanted to go.

Meanwhile, in Andrew's car, Nicole wept dramatically. "Andrew, what about me now that you've bought her?"

"You'll be Mrs. Lucas." Andrew stared straight ahead. "She means nothing."

Nicole clenched her skirt, venom flashing in her eyes. She wouldn't let Susan live to ruin her wedding.

Watching the approaching villa, Susan felt a growing sense of dread. The gears of fate were dragging them deeper into the abyss.
###Chapter 71: Susan Meets Andrew's Family

The golden gates of the Silver Bay Villas shimmered under the sunlight. This was the most prestigious luxury neighborhood in Seaview City, where land prices were exorbitant enough to deter ordinary people. The entire villa complex belonged to the Lucas Group.

Ethan Sullivan's sports car glided deeper into the estate. Susan gazed at the increasingly opulent scenery outside the window, her fingers tightening around the hem of her dress. She hadn't expected Ethan to bring her to such a place.

"We're here." Ethan parked and led Susan into a sprawling mansion. When she saw the people seated in the living room, she froze.

Andrew Lucas sat stiffly on the sofa, his expression cold, with Nicole Capra smirking beside him. But what shocked her more was the presence of Thomas Lucas, the head of the Lucas Group, and his wife Victoria. Also present were Ryan Lucas, the eldest son of the family, and Bella Lucas, an international superstar.

Ethan grinned and pulled Susan forward. He'd brought her here today specifically to gain the Lucas family's approval. If the elders liked her, Andrew would have no excuse to keep harassing her.

"Aunt Victoria!" Ethan spotted Victoria pouring tea. "Susan's hurt. Do you have any special ointment?"

Victoria looked up, her gaze warm yet assessing. As a renowned medical expert, she immediately noticed the severity of Susan's injuries. What surprised her more was the inexplicable sense of familiarity this girl evoked.

"I do." Victoria went upstairs and returned with two delicate porcelain jars. "Use the white one for her hand, the green for her forehead. Apply it regularly to prevent scarring."

Susan instinctively touched the wound on her forehead. She'd thought the scar would stay with her forever, but now there was hope.

"Thank you, ma'am." Ethan took the ointment and carefully applied it to Susan's injuries. His touch was so gentle, as if handling a treasure, that Andrew's glare turned icy.

Susan felt the piercing stare but deliberately avoided looking at Andrew. Instead, she focused on Ethan's attentive expression, warmth blooming in her chest.

"Does it still hurt?" Ethan asked softly.

Susan shook her head, her eyes stinging slightly. In this world, apart from Grandma Thompson, Ethan was the only one who cared for her like this.

Victoria watched their interaction with affectionate amusement before turning to Ethan. "Aren't you going to introduce us to this young lady?"

"This is Susan Thompson, the girl I'm pursuing." Ethan announced proudly, then whispered in Susan's ear, "That grumpy one is Ryan. We call him 'Little Ryan.' He was terrifying as a kid."

"Ethan Sullivan!" Bella suddenly jumped up. "How dare you badmouth my brother?"

Ethan immediately feigned innocence. "Bella, can't you let me save face?"

Bella burst out laughing and scrutinized Susan. "What do you see in this fool, sweetheart?"

Caught off guard, Susan stammered, "Ethan is... very kind."

Bella doubled over with laughter and pinched Susan's cheek. "Where did you find such an adorable girl, Ethan?"

Susan was stunned by the superstar's friendliness. Up close, Bella was even more radiant, her youthful glow belying her age.

"Bella," Susan blurted out, "you look younger than me."

The room erupted in laughter. Bella slapped her thigh in delight. "Such a charmer! I like you!" She leaned in conspiratorially. "So, when's the wedding?"
###Chapter 72: The Darkest Among the Lucas Men

Susan Thompson froze at Bella Lucas's sudden question. How did the conversation jump from cuteness to marriage?

Her cheeks burned. From the corner of her eye, she noticed Ethan Sullivan's face was even redder than hers.

Just as Ethan opened his mouth, Andrew Lucas's icy voice cut in. "Second sister, switching careers to matchmaking now?"

Bella stiffened, turning to face her younger brother's stormy expression. "Andrew, are you on the wrong meds?"

"You're the one with hormonal imbalances! Acting like a woman on her period!"

Andrew's face darkened further, especially at being humiliated like this in front of Susan.

"Alright, enough," Victoria Lucas intervened. "The food's getting cold. Let's eat."

She pulled Susan to sit beside her, piling her plate with dishes. "Susan, try my braised pork ribs."

Susan forced a smile and took a bite. Her expression instantly froze.

It was terrible!

But under Victoria's hopeful gaze, she bravely took another bite.

"Delicious, right?" Victoria beamed. "Thomas loves my ribs the most!"

Susan glanced at Thomas Lucas, who was eating the ribs without batting an eye. He met his wife's gaze with a tender smile. "Yes, my wife's cooking is the best."

Susan stared in disbelief. What kind of love could make someone lie so effortlessly?

Watching the couple, she was deeply moved by their silent understanding.

Though past fifty, time had been kind to Thomas. Sitting with his two sons, they looked more like brothers than father and sons. His mature charm outshone them both.

Victoria was equally well-preserved, her clear eyes girlishly bright. Standing with Bella, they resembled sisters.

The Lucas genes were undeniably strong. All three men shared striking handsomeness, yet each had distinct traits.

Thomas was steady and reserved, exuding aristocratic grace.

Ryan Lucas was aloof yet carried a reassuring warmth.

And Andrew... Susan stole a glance at him. He was like an unsheathed sword—sharp, dangerous, and brooding.

Thoughts of Daniel made her eyes sting. If he were still here, how happy he'd be...

Ethan noticed her distress, mistaking it for tears over the awful ribs. He snatched the rib from her hand and stuffed it into his mouth. "So good!"

Thud!

Andrew slammed his chopsticks down, glaring icily at Ethan.

He'd eaten the rib Susan had bitten!

Ethan ignored him, grinning as he leaned toward Susan. "Susan, I don't need to watch my figure. Feed me some shrimp, okay?"

His puppy-dog eyes reminded her of Daniel's playful pouts. Softening, she lifted a shrimp to his lips.

"And some broccoli!" Ethan pushed his luck.

Bella rolled her eyes. "Ethan, have you no shame?"

Victoria scolded her daughter. "It's called romance! No wonder you're single!"

Ethan smirked. "Exactly! Susan feeds me, and I'll be her devoted servant. Perfect!"

"Susan, will you feed me forever?"

Crash!

The glass in front of Andrew shattered, shards flying everywhere.
###Chapter 73: Nicole's Scheme

Andrew Lucas was gently serving Susan Thompson when he suddenly shattered his teacup.

The sharp sound made Victoria Lucas frown.

"Andrew!" She slammed the table, eyes blazing with anger. "What's wrong with you?"

Thomas Lucas set down his chopsticks, his stern gaze shifting to his eldest son.

The entire living room fell silent.

"My apologies." Andrew's voice was flat, but his eyes remained fixed on Susan.

His fists clenched, knuckles turning white.

Nicole Capra noticed, a flicker of malice crossing her eyes.

She gracefully lifted her teacup and took a sip.

"Aunt Victoria," she said sweetly, "do you know Susan's true identity?"

Ethan Sullivan shot to his feet, his gaze icy.

"Nicole!" he snapped. "Don't you dare!"

Susan's fingers trembled slightly.

Her worst fear was coming true.

"She's my adoptive mother's biological daughter," Nicole smiled, "and the one who turned my mother into a vegetative state."

A glass shattered at Nicole's feet.

Shards scattered everywhere.

"Get out." Ethan's voice was frigid. "Or I won't hold back."

Susan turned pale, shakily rising to her feet.

"I'm sorry..." she whispered, turning to leave.

A warm hand caught hers.

Victoria looked at her with firm resolve.

"I believe you."

Three simple words that made Susan's eyes burn.

Bella Lucas swirled her wine glass lazily.

"Ethan might be an idiot, but he's got good judgment."

She smirked at Nicole, her eyes full of mockery.

"Unlike some people," Bella sneered, "who've mastered the art of pretending."

Nicole's face darkened.

She hadn't expected the Lucas family to defend Susan like this.

"Aunt Victoria—" she tried again.

"Enough." Victoria cut her off. "This ends now."

Susan gazed at Victoria's gentle profile, warmth flooding her chest.

For the first time in this house, she felt what it was like to be trusted.

Andrew stood in the shadows, his expression unreadable.

Watching Susan surrounded by the others made his chest tighten inexplicably.

Nicole dug her nails into her palms.

She wouldn't accept defeat.

This war had only just begun.
###Chapter 74: Ethan's Grand Gesture, Andrew's Burning Jealousy

"Even if she were just an ordinary guest of the Lucas family, you shouldn't treat her this way!"

Bella Lucas's voice was icy.

Nicole Capra's eyes instantly welled up with tears.

"Bella, I—"

"Save your tears." Bella frowned in disgust. "I'm tired of this act."

Andrew Lucas watched as Ethan Sullivan and Susan Thompson intertwined their fingers, feeling as if a sledgehammer had struck his chest. He pulled Nicole into his arms.

"Second Sister, Nicole meant well."

Ethan sneered. "Andrew, don't come crying later."

He led Susan back to their seats, carefully picking bones out of a piece of fish.

"Susan, open up."

Before she could refuse, the fish was already at her lips. She took a small bite.

Andrew's grip on his chopsticks turned his knuckles white. He suddenly grabbed his glass, shattering it in his palm without flinching.

"Andrew!"

Nicole's scream snapped him out of it. He hid his bleeding hand behind his back, expressionless.

Just then, servants filed in carrying roses.

"Miss Thompson, you're beautiful."

"Miss Thompson, you deserve the best love."

In moments, the living room became a sea of roses.

Susan looked at Ethan in confusion. Mischief sparkled in his eyes.

"Look outside," the last servant said with a smile.

The yard was filled with children in red scarves, each holding a rose.

"Susan, Ethan likes you!"

"Be his girlfriend!"

Their cheers rose like waves.

A roar filled the sky as two helicopters unfurled banners: "Susan, I love you." Hot air balloons followed close behind.

The giant screen atop Oceanview Tower lit up with a heart, blooming into words of love.

The entire city was witnessing this grand confession.

Ethan took a rose from a child and knelt on one knee.

"Susan, I fell for you at first sight."

Tears welled in Susan's eyes. Before she could speak, Ethan added,

"Don't think too long. I want to love you every second I can."

He leaned in for a kiss—only to meet a pair of sharply defined fingers.

Andrew's hand.
###Chapter 75: Susan Thompson Isn't Good Enough for Ethan Sullivan!

Ethan stared at the hand he'd just kissed, his stomach churning violently.

He shoved Andrew away and doubled over, retching.

Andrew wiped his knuckles methodically, brows slightly furrowed.

"Andrew! Have you lost your mind?"

Ethan straightened up after wiping his mouth and shoved Andrew hard.

"Go kiss Nicole if you're so desperate! Stop interfering with Susan and me!"

Nicole quickly clung to Andrew's arm, voice trembling. "Andrew, must you break my heart like this?"

"If your mother finds out about you and Susan—"

Andrew's body stiffened. He turned away from Susan standing among the flowers.

Susan froze in place.

Did Ethan just kiss Andrew again?

Why did this man keep letting other men kiss him?

Ethan grabbed Susan's hand and ran.

His objective today was accomplished—now he just wanted alone time with the woman he loved.

Andrew's fingers turned white-knuckled. Only Nicole's tight grip stopped him from chasing after them.

Victoria's eyes widened.

She glanced between the fleeing Ethan and the ice-cold Andrew, her chest tightening.

"Thomas..." Her voice shook. "Why did Andrew block that kiss for Susan?"

"During dinner, I noticed he shattered his glass when Ethan served Susan food!"

"Could it be... he has feelings for Ethan?"

Thomas's mouth twitched.

He saw the truth but dared not speak it.

Seeing Andrew still staring into the distance, Victoria smacked his head in fury.

"Andrew Lucas! Ethan finally found love, and you're sabotaging it!"

"They're not compatible." Andrew's expression darkened. "That woman isn't good enough for Ethan."

Victoria nearly fainted.

This confirmed it!

No wonder he ignored Nicole—his target was her brother all along!

"Even if Susan and Ethan aren't perfect, you can't be with Ethan either!" Victoria lamented.

Andrew: ?

Thomas quickly embraced his wife. "Don't upset yourself."

"Get off!" She pushed him away, pointing at their three children. "Look what you've produced!"

"Andrew likes men! Our second son is allergic to women! Bella dumped her fiancé!"

"Will I ever hold a grandchild in my arms?!"

Thomas: "...Should we try for another?"

"Have one yourself!" Victoria stormed inside.

Ryan approached Andrew. "We need to talk."

Nicole tactfully stepped away.

"Speak."

"I know about your secret marriage." Ryan's gaze sharpened. "As your elder brother, I'll give you the same advice."

"The same one I gave our father years ago."
###Chapter 76 If She Dies, He'd Celebrate with Firecrackers!

"What do you mean?" Andrew Lucas frowned deeply.

Ryan Lucas maintained his usual aloof expression, though a trace of concern flickered in his eyes. "Cruelty brings momentary pleasure, but regret lasts a lifetime. Andrew, don't wait until it's too late."

"Regret?" Andrew scoffed. "If Susan Thompson dies, I'll celebrate with firecrackers!"

His words rang with absolute conviction, unaware that fate had already set the stage. Soon, he would indeed be standing at a crematorium, bidding Susan farewell...

Ethan Sullivan pulled Susan all the way outside the Clearwater Bay villas before stopping.

His sunshine smile remained unchanged. "Susan, now that we're alone, we can finally focus on our relationship."

Susan took a deep breath. "Ethan, I can't accept your feelings."

His smile faltered momentarily before rebounding. "That's alright. Feelings can develop over time."

"You deserve someone better." Her voice softened. "I'm not worthy of you."

"Nonsense! To me, you're perfect!"

Susan knew she had to be clear. "If I had years to live, maybe I'd try to love you. But my time is limited. I won't drag you down."

"What do you mean?" Ethan's grip on her hand tightened abruptly.

"Stage four gastric cancer." She spoke the diagnosis calmly. "Meeting you was my last stroke of luck, but I refuse to burden you."

Ethan's face drained of color. "Impossible!"

Without another word, he rushed her to City General Hospital. When the test results came, his hands trembled so violently he could barely hold the report.

"At most... two weeks." The doctor delivered the prognosis nervously.

Ethan collapsed as if all strength had left him.

"Now do you believe me?" Susan forced a smile. "Please forget about me."

Suddenly, she found herself engulfed in a crushing embrace. Ethan's voice broke. "I won't let go! Even if we only have one day left, I'll stay by your side!"

"We can visit Aunt Victoria—she'll know what to do!"

Susan shook her head. "I won't return to the Lucas estate."

Ethan's eyes reddened as he compromised. "Then let me stay as your friend. Please?"

She finally nodded, silently etching this kindness into her heart.

As they stepped out of the hospital, a screech of brakes shattered the air—

A horrific accident unfolded in the middle of the road. The figure lying in a pool of blood was someone Susan recognized instantly...
###Chapter 77: Irrefutable Evidence! Susan's Helpless Defense!

The evening streets buzzed with traffic when a screeching brake pierced the sky.

Susan Thompson turned toward the commotion, finding a crowd gathered at the intersection. She meant to walk away until a familiar face froze her in place.

Louis Lynch!

His bloodied features twisted grotesquely in the sunset. The missing mask revealed his contorted expression. Though his body lay mangled, that recognizable face remained intact—as if fate demanded Susan recognize him.

"They say the black car chased him down three times..."

The bystanders' whispers crawled into Susan's ears. Her nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

The monster who'd pushed little Daniel off the cliff had finally faced justice.

Then ice flooded her veins.

This wasn't an accident.

This was murder.

Nicole Capra was silencing witnesses!

Shivering, Susan returned to Willow Lane Apartments. Before she could process the horror, her front door shuddered under violent blows.

"Who's there?"

Her trembling fingers fumbled with a new phone. She'd barely dialed 9-1-1 when the lock shattered.

Four black-suited brutes stormed in.

Vincent King's men!

Memories of severed fingers surged through her. Susan barricaded herself in the bedroom, the emergency call connecting just as the door exploded inward.

"Help! Somebo—"

Her phone shattered against the floor. A burlap sack swallowed her whole, that familiar suffocation returning.

The trunk's jostling churned her stomach. When the sack ripped open, Vincent's livid face loomed under blinding lights.

"How dare you, Susan!"

His grip crushed her windpipe, stars bursting behind her eyelids.

"Hiring hitmen to kill Candy? You've got a death wish?"

Gasping, Susan shook her head. Oxygen deprivation blurred her vision.

"Not me... Candy staged it..."

"Lies!" Vincent released her, hurling papers at her face.

Bank transfers.

Recipient: Lucas Lynch.
Sender: Her account.

Susan's pupils contracted.

That account—the one she'd given the kidnappers!

Nicole had planned everything. The leftover ransom became Susan's death sentence.

"Any last words?" Vincent's voice could freeze hell.

The documents crumpled in Susan's white-knuckled grip.

She'd fallen into a meticulously crafted trap.
###Chapter 78: Crushing Susan Thompson!

"I have proof!"

Susan Thompson struggled to her feet, the wounds on her back burning with searing pain. She gritted her teeth. "That card was mine, but the kidnappers stole it three days ago!"

"When Daniel was kidnapped, they used that card to extort me!" Her gaze locked onto Vincent King's icy eyes. "Nicole Capra and Candy Wilson are working together. This is their scheme!"

"Susan." Vincent's lips curled into a chilling smile. "Do you really think I'd believe such a ridiculous story?"

His slender fingers tapped rhythmically on the wheelchair armrest. "For every drop of Candy's blood you spilled, I'll make you repay a hundredfold."

A bitter laugh rose in Susan's throat. The gentle Vincent she once knew had become this delusional monster.

"Vincent, listen carefully." She enunciated each word. "I have zero interest in you or Candy."

"Is that so?"

With a flick of his wrist, bodyguards rushed forward, binding Susan with coarse ropes. The other end was secured to his black Maybach.

Her pupils contracted.

"Vincent! Are you insane?" She thrashed violently. "This is murder!"

A sharp pain tore through her stomach. Blood gushed from her lips, staining her white blouse crimson.

Vincent's brow twitched almost imperceptibly before his expression hardened again.

He slid gracefully into the driver's seat, lowering the window. "Last chance. Confess."

"I did nothing wrong!" Susan lifted her chin defiantly.

The engine roared to life.

Tires screeched as Susan was yanked forward, her body slamming onto the gravel path. Jagged stones shredded her clothes, carving bloody gashes across her skin.

Pain.

Every bone screamed in agony.

Her vision blurred. In the haze, she remembered the Vincent who took a knife for her in that dungeon. Now he would kill her with his own hands.

"Vincent...you'll regret this..."

Her voice faded, swallowed by the howling wind.

Before darkness claimed her, she heard the piercing screech of brakes.

Splash!

Ice-cold water drenched her.

Susan woke coughing violently, tied to the courtyard's plane tree. Every inch of her body throbbed. The water had seeped into her wounds, sending fresh waves of torment.

"Ready to talk?" Vincent stood before her, his black coat billowing in the wind.

She lifted heavy eyelids. "I...didn't..."

"Stubborn fool."

Vincent turned toward the car. The engine growled again. This time, the vehicle pointed directly at her.

He meant to run her over.

Susan laughed. How ironic—the man she'd nearly died saving would now send her to hell.

The tires screeched closer.

Ten meters.

Five.

Three...

Boom!

The Maybach slammed into the tree. Leaves rained down as the trunk shuddered violently.

The hood stopped half a meter from her body.

Vincent emerged, gripping her chin with bruising force. "Three seconds."

Susan closed her eyes.

"Three."

"Two."

"One."

Silence.

With a snarl, Vincent punched the tree beside her head. "You're dead!"

He tore off his tie, retrieving a gasoline can from the trunk. The acrid smell filled the air.

"If you're so determined to protect your accomplices," he poured the liquid around her feet, "take your secrets to the grave."

The gasoline formed a deadly circle.

Click.

A blue flame danced from his lighter.

Vincent held it aloft, his eyes darker than the abyss. "Final warning."

Susan watched the flickering fire calmly.

"Vincent," she whispered, "when your memories return..."

"Don't grieve too much."
###Chapter 79: The Truth Revealed

Susan's eyelashes trembled violently.

She never imagined she would die this way.

Vincent's sports car sped down the highway, the wind howling like the whisper of death. Susan's back was already torn and bloody from the rough ground, but she felt no pain.

Images flashed through her mind, each one twisting her heart like a knife.

Daniel's innocent smile. Ethan's warm touch. And... Andrew's perpetually cold eyes.

"Boom!"

A deafening crash made Susan's ears ring.

She forced her eyes open to see a red sports car swerving recklessly toward them, forcing Vincent's car to a screeching halt.

The door was kicked open violently, and Ethan appeared like an avenging angel.

"Susan!"

His voice shook.

She had never seen him like this—his usually smiling eyes now bloodshot, veins bulging at his temples. He reached for her cautiously but flinched the moment his fingers grazed her wounds.

"I'm fine," Susan forced a weak smile.

Ethan's fist slammed into the car door with a sickening metallic crunch. "Vincent! Are you even human?!"

Vincent stepped out of the car, his black coat billowing in the wind. His cold gaze swept over Susan as if she were already a corpse. "She hurt my Candy. She has to pay."

"Bullshit!" Ethan knocked aside a bodyguard blocking his path. "Susan's been with me all day. When would she have time to hire someone to attack Candy?"

Vincent smirked. "The evidence is clear."

"Evidence?" Ethan suddenly laughed, the sound making Vincent tense. He pulled out his phone and dialed. "Nathan, bring it here!"

Within minutes, Nathan arrived, panting, clutching a tablet.

"Take a good look, Mr. King." Nathan tapped the screen, revealing footage of Candy sneaking around like a thief.

Vincent's pupils constricted.

The woman in the video bore no resemblance to the Candy he knew. She glanced around furtively before slipping into a private room. When the door opened, Vincent's face drained of color—

Inside sat the very men who had kidnapped Daniel.

"This... can't be..." Vincent's voice trembled.

Ethan grabbed his collar. "See it now? Your precious angel is the real viper!"

Susan lifted her head weakly, watching as all color left Vincent's face. His lips quivered, disbelief flooding his eyes.

"There's more." Nathan played an audio clip.

Candy's saccharine voice rang out: "Just do as I say, and money won't be an issue... Yes, pin it on Susan..."

The recording cut off abruptly.

Vincent staggered back as if struck. He turned to Susan, the disgust in his eyes replaced by shock.

"Convinced now?" Ethan sneered. "You nearly killed Susan for that woman!"

Vincent's throat worked, but no words came out. He remembered Candy's tearful accusations, the countless times he'd defended her...

He had been the fool all along.

Susan watched Vincent's shattered expression and found it bitterly amusing. She struggled to her feet, blood dripping from her wounds onto the pavement.

"Mr. King, may I leave now?"

Her voice was soft, but each word cut into Vincent like a blade.
###Chapter 80: The Truth Revealed

Vincent King stood at the private room's entrance, his fingertips trembling slightly.

He recognized the two men inside.

The dark-skinned, gaunt Lucas Lynch was the hit-and-run driver who had injured Candy Wilson earlier that day. The purple-haired gang leader in ripped leather? He had kidnapped Candy just last month.

Yet there Candy sat, laughing and clinking glasses between them.

"Mr. King..." Nathan Foster hesitated before handing over the tablet.

On screen, Candy beamed as she poured liquor for Lucas, patting his shoulder affectionately. This was no victim-perpetrator dynamic.

Ethan Sullivan yanked the bound Lucas up by the collar, grinding his polished shoe into the man's face.

"Look familiar?" Ethan sneered. "Nathan tailed Candy and caught a big fish."

Lucas' eyes darted nervously. "Miss Wilson ordered the hit! The bank records—"

"Bullshit!" Ethan's kick silenced him. "You're cozy with Candy in that video, now you play dumb?"

The tablet clattered before Lucas. The damning footage of their toast left him ashen.

"Mr. King, save me!" He lunged at Vincent. "I work for Miss Wilson!"

The words stabbed Vincent's heart like a blade.

He stared down at the man who'd once testified against Susan Thompson. Every piece of evidence had been an elaborate lie.

Ethan cradled Susan's limp body, eyes bloodshot as he brushed past. "You're blind, Vincent."

Vincent stood frozen.

Susan's bloodied sleeve grazed his suit. Drops from her severed finger stained his polished shoes. That searing crimson made his heart constrict.

"To the hospital." Ethan's voice shook with restraint. "We'll settle this later."

As the black Maybach vanished into the night, Vincent remained. Winter winds swirled snowflakes around the tablet buzzing in his grip.

The frozen frame showed Candy raising her glass, crimson nails resting intimately on Lucas' shoulder.
###Chapter 81: The Mystery of the Severed Finger

Blood seeped from Susan Thompson's severed finger again.

The rough ground tore open the half-healed wound, revealing a gruesome sight of mangled flesh. Vincent King stared at the mutilated finger, his heart gripped by an invisible fist.

A sudden realization struck him—Susan was innocent.

The truth nearly made him stagger. He had personally destroyed an innocent girl's life, making her lose that pinky forever.

What terrified him more was that if Ethan Sullivan hadn't intervened today, Susan would have been crushed beneath the wheels.

"Get out!" Vincent kicked Liu Jianwen aside and stormed toward the basement behind the villa like a madman.

Roger Davis hurried after him. He had never seen Young Master Vincent so unhinged.

Bang!

The wooden door shattered under Vincent's kick. His eyes bloodshot, he frantically rummaged through the basement like a deranged beast.

"Young Master, what are you looking for?" Roger asked cautiously.

"Susan's finger!" Vincent's voice was hoarse with desperation.

Roger froze. The severed finger should have rotted away by now. What was the point of searching? But he didn't dare question it, dropping to his knees to help.

The bloodstains remained, but the finger was nowhere to be found.

"Young Master... it might be gone," Roger forced himself to say.

"Gone?" Vincent's expression turned eerily calm. "What do you mean, gone?"

Roger immediately summoned all available hands to search. One trembling bodyguard hesitantly raised his hand.

"I... I know where the finger is."

"Speak!" Vincent barked.

"It... it was fed to the dogs," the bodyguard stammered. "Miss Wilson gave it to Miss Capra, and she fed it to the wolfhound in the backyard."

Vincent grabbed the bodyguard by the collar, his eyes flashing with a pain Roger had never seen before.

At that moment, Roger swore he heard something shatter.

Vincent shoved the bodyguard aside and strode out. By the time Roger caught up, the taillights of the black Lamborghini had already vanished into the night.

In the VIP hospital room, Candy Wilson lay weakly on the bed. When Vincent entered, her eyes instantly welled up with tears.

"Vincent..." she whimpered pitifully, tears streaming down. "It hurts so much..."

Instead of the expected embrace, she was met with Vincent's icy stare.

"Vincent, that car crash wasn't an accident," she ventured cautiously. "The driver hit me on purpose!"

"I know," Vincent replied tonelessly. "The driver confessed. He was hired."

Candy's heart leaped with joy, but she forced her expression into one of sorrow. "Who would want me dead?"

"Susan."

Candy nearly failed to suppress her smirk, quickly feigning devastation. "Why would Susan do this? I always thought of her as my best friend..."

"Best friend?" Vincent suddenly let out a cold laugh. "Candy, did you ever truly consider Susan a friend?"

It was the first time he had addressed her by her full name.

A chill ran down Candy's spine. She realized things had spiraled out of her control.
###Chapter 82: Possession Out of Control

Candy Wilson's fingers clenched the bedsheet until her knuckles turned white. She didn't understand why Vincent King suddenly asked that question, but her instincts told her she had to give the perfect answer.

"Of course!" She forced a sweet smile. "The three of us grew up together. Susan is like a sister to me."

A faint, chilling smirk curled at Vincent's lips, making her heart skip.

"Then why..." He suddenly leaned in, his long fingers gripping her chin. "Did you keep trying to harm her?"

Candy's pupils shrank. All color drained from her face. She instinctively tried to pull back, but Vincent held her firmly in place.

"Vincent, what are you talking about? I would never—"

"Look at this." He tossed a tablet onto the bed. The screen displayed clear footage of her secret dealings with Nicole Capra.

Candy trembled violently, tears instantly welling up. "You've been spying on me?"

"That's not the point." His voice was ice-cold. "Why did you tell Nicole to feed Susan's severed finger to the dogs?"

"I didn't!" she shrieked, then immediately caught herself, replacing her panic with a pitiful expression. "I was just... scared..."

She clutched his sleeve, tears rolling down. "I was afraid you'd fall for her!"

Vincent frowned.

"That night..." She choked back a sob. "You know what you did to Susan after being drugged! I tried to help you afterward, but you pushed me away..."

Her voice grew more frantic, nails digging into her palms. "Four years, Vincent! I've given you everything, yet you'd rather touch her than me!"

A flicker of emotion crossed his face as he recalled Susan's delicate fragrance that night. His Adam's apple bobbed unconsciously.

"Candy..." He sighed and pulled her into his arms. "I won't love anyone else."

Resting against his shoulder, a shadow of malice flashed in her eyes. She knew his weakness too well—guilt.

"Promise me..." She looked up with tearful eyes. "You'll never leave me."

The moment Vincent nodded, his phone rang sharply. It was the hospital—Susan had been admitted to the ER again.

Meanwhile, Susan Thompson stared at her phone screen. Andrew Lucas's text contained only one line:
"8 p.m. The usual place."

Her fingers shook as she deleted the message, unaware that someone hidden in the shadows had captured everything with a camera.
###Chapter 83 Susan, Get Your Ass Over Here!

"Susan, deliver the items within half an hour!"

What items?

Susan froze momentarily before realization struck.

Andrew Lucas urgently needed her to bring condoms for his night with Nicole Capra.

"Susan, I brought the ointment." Ethan Sullivan approached with a medical kit, concern evident in his eyes. "Let me help apply it."

"No need, Mr. Sullivan. I can manage." Susan forced a weak smile. "I've already troubled you enough today."

"Don't be ridiculous!" Ethan frowned. "I'd do anything for you willingly!"

His gaze fell on the broken door lock. "This isn't safe. Stay at my place tonight."

"Really, I'm fine." Susan shook her head. "The property management will fix it."

Unable to persuade her, Ethan left with final instructions: "Keep the wounds dry. Apply ointment three times daily..."

After seeing Ethan out, Susan trembled while removing her soaked clothes. The burning pain across her back made her vision blur as fabric scraped against raw flesh.

Gritting her teeth, she cut away the ruined back panel and slipped into a loose jacket. The ointment from Victoria Lucas worked miracles - the swelling on her hand had already subsided.

While disinfecting her wounds with alcohol swabs, her phone vibrated violently.

"Susan, get over here now!"
"If I don't see those items in thirty minutes, you'll regret it!"

Her fingers shook as she replied: "Can't I skip tonight? I'm really unwell."

"Unwell? Too busy in Ethan's bed?"
"Show up within thirty minutes or Bella Quinn dies tonight!"

The final text froze Susan's blood. He always knew where to strike deepest.

Bracing against the cold wind, she tightened her jacket. Blood seeped from her severed finger inside the glove while icy gusts tore at her back wounds.

Facing the supermarket shelf, she hesitated before selecting the largest box. She lacked strength to endure his wrath tonight.

What difference between living and dying?
Now she understood - living meant pain, while death promised eternal peace.

At the villa gate, a sign reading "Susan and Dogs Prohibited" swayed in the night wind. The silent butler led her upstairs before quickly disappearing.

Standing before the door, Susan's raised hand hadn't yet knocked when it suddenly jerked open.
###Chapter 84: You're Not Worthy of Him

Susan Thompson was violently yanked into the room, her back slamming against the wall with a painful thud. She gasped sharply from the pain, lifting her eyes to meet Andrew Lucas's dark, furious gaze.

"I've brought what you asked for, Mr. Lucas," she said through gritted teeth, holding out the shopping bag despite the throbbing ache.

Andrew ignored the bag. Instead, he seized her wrist in a bruising grip. "In such a hurry to leave?" His lips curled into a sneer. "Is Ethan Sullivan waiting for you in bed?"

Susan tried to pull free but failed. Her fever had spiked to 39 degrees, leaving her weak and lightheaded.

"You're mistaken, Mr. Lucas," she whispered hoarsely. "I just didn’t want to interrupt you and Miss Capra."

"Interrupt?" Andrew suddenly closed the distance between them, his hot breath fanning her face. "Susan, stop pretending to be virtuous."

The wounds on her back began to bleed again. She bit her lip, afraid to move.

"Ethan and I are just friends," she attempted to explain.

Andrew flung her onto the bed. The impact sent a wave of dizziness through her, nearly knocking her unconscious.

"Friends?" He ripped off his tie. "A woman like you doesn’t deserve friends."

Susan tried to push herself up, but her limbs felt like lead. She spotted the bloodstain spreading on the sheets and knew she couldn’t hold on much longer.

"Mr. Lucas..." Her voice was barely audible. "I really can’t today..."

Andrew leaned down, gripping her chin. "What, saving yourself for Ethan?"

Tears spilled down her cheeks as she shook her head. She wanted to explain, but she lacked even the strength to speak.

"Stop faking tears!" He tore open her coat with brutal force.

The fabric, stuck to her wounds, was ripped away. Susan arched in agony, her vision flickering.

"Andrew..." She finally broke. "I just had surgery!"

He froze.

Seizing the moment, Susan shoved him away and curled into the corner of the bed. The back of her nightgown was soaked with blood, revealing the gruesome wound beneath.

Andrew’s pupils contracted sharply. "Who did this?"

"It doesn’t matter." She wiped her tears. "In your eyes, I’ll always be the dirtiest one."

The room fell into an eerie silence.

Andrew stared at her pale face, an inexplicable tightness gripping his chest. He reached for her, but she flinched away.

"Don’t touch me." Her voice trembled. "You disgust me."

The words ignited his fury. He pinned her down again, but at the sight of her pained expression, his grip loosened against his will.

Susan scrambled off the bed, crawling toward the door on unsteady limbs.

"Stop!" Andrew barked.

She didn’t listen. Staying here any longer would kill her.

Her fingers brushed the doorknob when a heavy thud sounded behind her. She turned to see Andrew on his knees, his face even paler than hers.

"You—" Susan froze in shock.

Andrew lifted his head, his gaze both fierce and fragile. "Susan, take one more step and see what happens."

Darkness swallowed her vision. Her body gave out, and she collapsed to the floor.
###Chapter 85: Bloodstained Scars - Andrew's Rage

Andrew Lucas's heart stopped beating.

His eyes remained fixed on Susan Thompson's pale face. Only when he saw the faint rise and fall of her chest did his pulse resume.

"Susan!" His voice was hoarse beyond recognition.

His fingertips brushed against the dampness on her back. When he pulled his hand away, it was covered in crimson. Andrew's pupils constricted violently as unprecedented fury surged through him.

"Who did this?"

Silence answered him.

He carefully gathered her into his arms but froze when his hand grazed her left wrist. The leather glove was soaked with blood, fused to the wound beneath.

His movements were impossibly gentle, yet fresh droplets of blood still welled up.

"Mmm..." Susan frowned unconsciously in her unconscious state.

Andrew's breath hitched. He had never seen her like this—so fragile she might shatter at the slightest touch. The woman who usually bared her claws at him now lay frighteningly still.

Another patch of red bloomed across her shirt.

Andrew tore off his tie and dialed Bella Lucas. "Bring Mom's special medication. Now."

"You're hurt?" Bella's voice shot up an octave.

"Twenty minutes." He hung up and called Leo Miller instead. "Find out who hurt her. I want answers before dawn."

Before Leo could respond, the sound of shattering glass came through the line.

"Boss?"

"If you can't find out, get your ass transferred to the African branch."

When Bella burst into the apartment, she found Andrew standing by the bed, his aura dark and oppressive. The sight of the curled-up figure on the mattress drained the color from her face.

"You actually—"

She yanked back the thin blanket and gasped. Crisscrossing wounds still oozed blood across Susan's back, and her left hand was a mangled mess.

"Andrew, have you lost your mind?" Bella hurled the medical kit at him. "Torturing a woman? You're a disgrace to the Lucas name!"

Andrew sidestepped the projectile, his expression murderous. "It wasn't me."

"Then who? Nicole Capra?" Bella sneered. "Hurting the real deal over some stand-in? How impressive!"

Susan jerked violently when the antiseptic touched her wounds.

"Be gentle!" Andrew seized Bella's wrist.

She shook him off. "Now you care?" Suddenly leaning closer to Susan's face, she recoiled in shock. "This is... Susan?"

The air turned to ice.

"You found her?" Bella's voice trembled. "And then did this to her?"

Andrew's jaw clenched. "I said it wasn't me."

"Then who?" A strange look crossed Bella's face. "Don't tell me... it's because of Ethan Sullivan?"

Seeing her brother's stormy expression, realization dawned. "You're jealous she's with Ethan? Andrew, when did you become so despic—"

"Shut up!"

At that moment, Susan's eyes fluttered open.

The cotton swab fell from Bella's fingers. She whirled on Andrew and grabbed his collar. "You're finished! I'm calling Ethan right now!"

"Don't you dare!"

"Watch me!" Bella pulled out her phone. "When Ethan finds out what you did to his girlfri—"

"She's my wife."

Five simple words froze Bella mid-motion.

"What?"

Andrew stared at the frail figure on the bed, his gaze unreadable. "Susan has always been my wife."
###Chapter 86: The Ruthless Third Young Master Lucas

"Bella, don't call Ethan Sullivan!"

Susan Thompson grabbed Bella Lucas's wrist before she could dial. She'd already troubled Ethan enough tonight and didn't want to disturb him further.

"But Andrew hurt you this badly..." Bella's heart ached as she took in Susan's pale face.

"It wasn't Mr. Lucas." Susan forced herself upright, wrapping the quilt around her bruised body. "I was just delivering something."

Gritting her teeth, she gathered her scattered clothes. Each movement felt like torture as her wounds stuck to the fabric. The searing pain in her stomach made her vision blur, but she kept her back straight.

"My delivery is done. I'm leaving now."

"Stop!" Andrew Lucas reached for her, but Bella blocked him.

"Bullying a girl? How pathetic!" Bella turned to Susan, softening her tone. "Let me drive you home?"

"No need." Susan shook her head. "I'll take a cab."

Seeing Andrew's rising fury, Bella flicked his forehead hard.

"Bella Lucas!" His eyes turned icy.

"What?" She planted her hands on her hips. "Want me to tell Mom how you harassed Ethan's girlfriend?"

That shut him up. Bella's gaze landed on the scattered condom boxes, and her eyes widened.

"Andrew Lucas! You made Susan deliver these?" She pointed at her brother in disbelief. "You ignore Nicole Capra, have no women around, and need these for what? Blowing balloons?"

"Get out!" His face darkened.

"Tch!" Bella adjusted her sunglasses and mask. "The air here is polluted!" She stormed out in her stilettos.

Silence barely settled when Leo Miller's call came through.

"It was Candy Wilson's doing."

"Candy?" Andrew frowned.

"A rising star under our label. Just landed the lead in a major IP adaptation."

"Blacklist her." Two casual words ended an actress's career.

Hanging up, Andrew stared out the window at the falling snow. The image of Susan's frail figure flashed in his mind.

"Damn it!" He snatched his keys and bolted out.

Meanwhile, Susan had already hailed a cab—miraculously finding one right outside the villa. Clutching her stomach, she urged the driver to hurry.

The lock on her Willow Lane apartment was still broken. Pushing the door open, she heard Ethan's anxious voice: "Susan!"

"Why are you here?"

"You're hurt, and the door's broken..." His ears turned pink. "I was worried."

A sudden wave of pain hit. Her vision blacked out as she collapsed.

"Susan!"

"Medicine... bedroom..."

Ethan carried her to bed and administered her pills before exhaustion claimed him. Half-asleep, he instinctively climbed onto the mattress, hugging a pillow.

When Andrew kicked the door open, he found them entwined in slumber—an intimate scene that froze his blood.
###Chapter 87: She Committed Murder!

Andrew Lucas stood frozen at the bedroom doorway, his fingernails digging bloody crescents into his palms.

The quilt rose in suggestive curves. Susan Thompson's dark hair fanned across the pillow while Ethan Sullivan's bare arm peeked from beneath the covers. The sight drove into his chest like a serrated blade.

Lovers entwined.

On the very bed he'd once shared with Susan.

Andrew's vision swam crimson, the metallic tang of blood flooding his mouth. He remembered scouring the city like a madman for this woman last night. What a pathetic joke.

"Susan. You disgust me."

He turned sharply, knocking over a porcelain vase in the entryway. The shattering echoed through the silent night—just like their shattered past, impossible to piece back together.

Icy wind hurled snow pellets against his face, but Andrew felt nothing. His trembling hands failed to light the cigarette between his lips.

Morning sunlight filtered through sheer curtains when Susan startled at the figure sprawled on her floor.

Ethan lay spread-eagled, his pajama shirt riding up to expose his navel, a corner of the duvet clamped between his teeth. Susan rushed to help him up when a dull thud interrupted.

"Christ, my spine—" Rubbing his head, Ethan blinked up at Susan's guilty expression. "Don't look at me like that, Sue. Floor sleeping's fantastic. Really!"

A violent sneeze catapulted him upright before he finished.

Susan's phone buzzed violently. The color drained from her face when she answered.

"What's wrong?" Ethan frowned.

"It's Bella." Susan's fingers turned to ice. "She's... been charged with murder."

In Greenhill Prison's visitation room, Susan barely recognized the woman before her. Bella Quinn crouched in the corner, her prison jumpsuit stained with rust-colored splotches, left ring finger bent at a sickening angle.

"They tortured you?" Susan's voice shook.

Bella's chains clanked as she shook her head. "Bruce said he'd spare the baby... if I confessed."

"It's Michelle, isn't it?" Susan gripped the bars. "The victim was William Ferber from Starlight Media. He exposed Michelle's casting couch scandal last month!"

Bella's pupils contracted.

"There was someone else in that private room." Susan leaned closer. "Who? Tell me!"

A snowflake drifted through the barred window, landing on Bella's cracked lips. She remembered Bruce's hands around her throat last night: "Mention Andrew, and your sickly sister dies on the operating table."

"No one else." Bella closed her eyes. "Sue, take care of Grandma."

As guards dragged Bella away, Susan deciphered three silent words on her friend's lips. She stood paralyzed until Ethan shook her shoulders.

"Sue? You're white as a ghost."

Susan turned mechanically. "Ethan, can you take me somewhere?"

She opened her palm, revealing smeared lipstick letters: "Surveillance Room." Bella's final clue.
###Chapter 88: She Doesn't Deserve to Bear His Child!

"Bella, are you okay?" Susan Thompson pressed her palm against the glass partition, her heart aching at the sight of Bella Quinn's bruised face.

Bella forced a weak smile, her pale fingers tracing her flat abdomen. "Susan... I'm pregnant."

Susan's pupils constricted.

"I want to keep this baby." Bella's whisper was feather-light. "Help me get bail. I'll return after the delivery."

Susan nodded immediately. She knew how dangerous prisons were—especially for pregnant women.

"I'll find a way." Susan clenched her fists. "I'll clear your name."

As Susan left the visitation room, Bruce Bowman entered with an icy aura.

Bella instinctively shrank back.

"Pregnant?" Bruce sneered, his gaze slicing across her stomach like a blade. "Seeking bail?"

Bella turned ghostly pale, shielding her abdomen. "How did you—"

"Bella Quinn." Bruce yanked her slender wrist. "Did you really think I'd let you win?"

"No!" She struggled. "This is your child!"

Disgust flickered in Bruce's eyes. "You think you're worthy of bearing my heir?"

He released her abruptly and barked toward the door, "Take her."

Black-clad men stormed in, dragging Bella away.

They shoved her into a trunk. Darkness swallowed her whole—just like her hopeless future.

In the private hospital's operating room, blinding white lights made Bella squeeze her eyes shut.

"Bruce, please—" Her voice cracked. "I really was the one who saved you during the earthquake—"

"Silence." Bruce stood impassively by the operating table.

A doctor approached with cold steel instruments.

"You'll regret this..." Bella whispered, shutting her eyes in despair.

"My only regret is not killing you sooner." Bruce turned away. "Proceed."

As agony tore through her, Bella remembered the eight-year-old boy who'd promised her a home. That same boy had now destroyed everything.

...

Susan's right eyelid twitched violently as she exited the prison.

She needed Andrew Lucas' testimony. As an eyewitness that night, his account was crucial.

Outside her apartment, she collided with a drunken Andrew.

"Susan." He seized her throat, bloodshot eyes burning. "Did you enjoy your time with Ethan Sullivan?"

Gasping for air, Susan still thought of Bella. "Andrew... help her—"

"Answer me!" Andrew tightened his grip in fury.
###Chapter 89: The Humiliation That Shattered Her Heart

Susan Thompson found Andrew Lucas utterly incomprehensible.

Her fingers clenched tightly, nails digging deep into her palms.

"Mr. Lucas, I don't understand what you mean," she forced out through gritted teeth, her voice trembling with suppressed fury.

"Stop pretending to be innocent," Andrew sneered, his dark eyes burning with cruelty. "Tell me—how many times have you slept with Ethan Sullivan?"

"You're despicable!" Susan's entire body shook with rage. "Ethan and I have never crossed that line!"

"Pathetic act," Andrew scoffed, gripping her chin roughly. "Susan, you disgust me."

The first time she heard those words, they had torn her apart.

Now, after hearing them so often, she felt nothing but numbness.

"Mr. Lucas," she closed her eyes wearily. "I need your help."

"Michelle Thompson committed murder, and Bruce Bowman is forcing Bella Quinn to take the blame. You were there—please testify for her."

The image of Bella covered in blood made her throat tighten.

"Greenhill Prison will kill her... Please..."

Andrew suddenly released her, his lips curling into a cruel smirk.

"Begging me? Is this how you ask for favors?"

Susan lowered her head, her voice barely audible. "Please... save Bella..."

"Fine." He leaned in, his breath hot against her ear. "Entertain me. If you satisfy me, I'll help her."

Her head snapped up, her face deathly pale.

"I'm injured... Can't you ask for something else?"

"Injured?" His gaze darkened. "Yet you still had the energy to seduce Ethan?"

A phone rang abruptly.

After answering, his lips twisted into a mocking smile.

"Trying to use a pregnancy to bail Bella out? Too bad... Bruce killed that child."

Susan's legs gave way, and she barely caught herself against the wall.

That was his own flesh and blood...

How could these men be so heartless?

"Entertain me," Andrew commanded coldly. "Or I'll make sure she rots in that cell."

Mechanically, she followed him inside.

The air in the living room was suffocating.

Trembling, she stepped forward, her lips bleeding from how hard she'd bitten them.

It didn't matter... She was dying anyway...

It didn't matter... She was already tainted...

"Take it off," he ordered icily.

Her coat clung to her wounds, and tearing it away sent sharp pain shooting through her, nearly making her black out.

Her stomach churned with agony, but she didn't dare stop.

As her clothes fell to the floor, the cold air bit into her skin.

"Kneel," he commanded, looking down at her with disdain. "Beg me to take you."
###Chapter 90: The Death of Bella Quinn

Susan's eyelashes fluttered like butterfly wings dampened by rain.

Her gaze drifted to the falling leaves outside the window, gradually losing focus. Her soul seemed detached, carried away by the cold wind.

She had surrendered at last.

Like a dog begging for mercy.

Her heart felt repeatedly sliced by a blunt knife. She couldn't tell whether her body or her heart hurt more. The pain was endless, clinging like a shadow.

Suddenly, she found it laughable.

How could a walking corpse still feel pain?

In her haze, she couldn't recall how long Andrew had tortured her. She only remembered collapsing on the floor like a discarded rag when it ended.

Too weak to even pick up her clothes.

"Susan, speak!" Andrew gripped her chin. "Who pleases you more—me or Ethan?"

Silently, she dressed herself and steadied herself against the sofa.

"Mr. Lucas, will you testify now?"

Dusk deepened outside the window.

Susan mocked herself—her battered body was surprisingly resilient, still clinging to life.

Her phone rang abruptly.

Seeing Michelle's name, her heart plummeted.

"Susan, I'm calling to inform you of Bella Quinn's death." The voice on the line dripped with sickly sweetness. "She jumped into the shark-infested waters. The suicide happened in the shark zone."

The phone clattered to the floor.

Susan trembled violently.

"Impossible... Bella was fine this morning..."

"The sea was red with blood." Michelle chuckled. "Too bad the sharks devoured her remains. Out of sisterly affection, I'm telling you to visit Golden Shark Bay to bid her farewell."

The call ended.

Darkness clouded Susan's vision.

Her dearest friend—gone without even a body left behind.

"Ugh—"

Blood gushed from her mouth.

"Susan!" Andrew frowned, then sneered. "Still playing the victim?"

Susan slowly raised her head.

Her eyes burned with bone-deep hatred.

"Bella is dead." Her voice was hoarse. "Are you satisfied now?"

Her heart threatened to explode from agony.

"Andrew Lucas, I hate you!"

"I'll never forgive you!"

A sudden panic seized Andrew.

For the first time, he truly felt he was losing her.

"Stop!" He grabbed Susan as she tried to rush out.

Her laughter was heartbreakingly beautiful. "What more can you threaten me with? Daniel's gone. Bella's gone..."

Her eyes were lifeless ashes.

"I have nothing left."
###Chapter 91: This Was Premeditated Murder!

"Andrew Lucas, your schemes won't work on me!" Susan Thompson straightened her back, her eyes blazing with defiance. "I have nothing left to fear now!"

"If you're still not satisfied—" She let out a bitter laugh. "I can give you my life too!"

"Don't touch me!"

Susan violently shook off Andrew's outstretched hand. The irony struck her—how easily love could turn to disgust.

As if she was born to despise this heartless man!

The mere sight of him made her sick.

Andrew's face darkened like storm clouds. No woman had ever dared treat him this way.

"Susan, do you really think I care about your worthless life?"

Her lips curved into a radiant yet painful smile.

She realized her mistake—her life hadn't belonged to her for a long time.

That organ donation agreement had robbed her of even the dignity of a proper burial.

Andrew hated her indifferent expression most—as if nothing in this world mattered to her, not even him.

His fingers clamped around her wrist like a vise, threatening to shatter bone.

He wanted to punish this insolent woman, yet feared she might actually break in his grasp.

"Going out dressed like that?" His voice dripped with scorn. "Do you enjoy being ogled by men?"

Only then did Susan notice her disheveled state. Stumbling into the bedroom, she changed clothes with the sluggish movements of an old woman.

She dry-swallowed painkillers before rushing out without water.

Andrew watched her swaying figure, his brow furrowed. When he saw the pills, his eyes turned glacial.

Birth control?

So desperate to avoid carrying his child?

Of course—a woman like her probably couldn't even identify her baby's father!

He hurled the pill bottle against the wall.

Downstairs, Ethan Sullivan arrived in a flurry, waving a red-stamped document.

"Susan! The bail's approved!" His grin was boyishly triumphant. "We can get your friend now!"

Susan stared blankly at the paper before tears erupted.

Too late.

Everything was too late.

"Ethan..." Her voice fractured. "Bella... she jumped..."

Ethan's face paled as he pulled her into an embrace. "We're going to Golden Shark Cliff now!"

The sports car shot like an arrow, reaching the blood-stained cliffs within forty minutes.

Nicole Capra stood there pushing Michelle Thompson's wheelchair, both basking in the sunset like victors.

"Too late, sister." Nicole's smile was saccharine. "Bella Quinn's already shark food."

Susan trembled violently. "What did you do to her?"

"We were just taking her to the hospital." Nicole batted innocent lashes. "Who knew she'd seduce four men right after her miscarriage..."

"When caught, she got so ashamed she jumped."

Susan's vision darkened. She knew Bella—this was cold-blooded murder!

Those monsters didn't just kill Bella's baby—they trampled her dignity in death!

SLAP!

The resounding crack echoed across the cliffs as Susan's palm connected with Nicole's face.
###Chapter 92: That Filthy Woman Deserved to Die!

Nicole Capra's smug grin hadn't even faded when Susan Thompson's palm cracked across her cheek.

"Sister, why did you hit me?" Nicole instantly transformed, tears welling in her eyes. "It hurts so much..."

Susan had no patience for her theatrics. She raised her hand to strike again.

A cold, powerful hand suddenly clamped around her wrist.

"Susan Thompson, you're asking for death!" Andrew Lucas's eyes burned with fury. Remembering how she'd embraced Ethan Sullivan moments ago, his grip tightened viciously.

Ethan rushed forward and shoved Andrew away. "Have you lost your mind, Lucas?"

He tenderly cradled Susan's reddened wrist. "Does it hurt, Susan? Let's go home and treat it."

"Oh, Susan's here." Michelle Thompson wheeled closer in her chair. "No one wanted what happened to Bella Quinn. Don't take it too hard."

Susan stared at that hypocritical face, her voice icy. "Did you hire those four men?"

"Susan, what are you talking about?" Michelle feigned innocence. "Bella brought it on herself—"

Crash!

Susan overturned the wheelchair.

Michelle fell onto jagged rocks, a long gash opening on her hand. "Bruce, help me! It hurts!"

Bruce Bowman finally snapped out of his daze at the cliff's edge. He strode over and gathered Michelle into his arms.

"Susan!" His eyes were bloodshot. "That bitch got what she deserved!"

"She had it coming!" Bruce's voice turned hoarse, as if trying to convince himself. "A filthy woman like that—she deserved to die!"

Susan's hand flew out in another stinging slap.

The crisp sound left everyone stunned.

"Susan!" Bruce roared with rage.

Ethan immediately stepped between them. "Touch her and you'll regret it!"

Bruce's hand froze midair. The girl who used to sweetly call him "big brother" was truly gone forever...

"Bruce," Susan's voice trembled, "do you feel no remorse for killing your own child? For driving Bella to her death?"
###Chapter 93: Unrequited Love and a Cursed Bloodline

Bruce Bowman staggered, his eyes burning with crimson fury.

His fists clenched so tightly his nails drew blood from his palms. Yet his spine remained rigid, his voice cold as steel. "She got what she deserved. Death was too merciful!"

"Hahahaha—"

Susan Thompson threw her head back with a shrill, broken laugh. She gazed at the churning waves in the distance, doubling over until tears streamed down her face.

Did you hear that, Bella? He doesn't regret it. Not even a shred of remorse!

This is the man you gave your life loving!

The laughter died abruptly. Susan whirled around, her eyes blazing with hatred.

"Bruce Bowman, remember your words today!"

"I curse you—may you never obtain what you desire, and may your bloodline end with you!"

How she wished she could kill this heartless man with her bare hands. But she was unarmed, and no match for him.

All she could do was carve this vicious curse into his bones with every syllable.

"Susan!" Michelle Thompson gasped. "How dare you speak to Bruce like that? He's your—"

"Shut up!" Susan snarled. "Michelle, do you really think fate will stay blind forever?"

"Stolen things must be returned!"

"I wish you a long life—one more miserable than death!"

Without another glance, she sprinted toward the cliff's edge.

The waves crashed against jagged rocks, spraying icy foam. A single plunge would leave barely a ripple.

The search team still combed the waters for any trace of Bella Quinn.

By midnight, they recovered only a bloodstained snow boot.

Susan clutched it with bone-white fingers. The dried blood had turned black, but the metallic stench remained.

She could almost see the sharks' razor teeth tearing into Bella's flesh...

"Susan..." Ethan Sullivan pulled her into his embrace, heartbroken. "Don't cry..."

Her entire body trembled as tears soaked his shirt. "Bella's gone... How much pain did she endure..."

Andrew Lucas stood in the shadows, his gaze venomous.

Watching the pair embrace felt like a knife twisting in his chest. He turned away without hearing Nicole Capra's call.

Susan wept until she collapsed, carried back to the apartment by Ethan.

She awoke at noon the next day. A sharp pain lanced through her stomach—but the painkillers on her nightstand had vanished.

The doorbell rang.

Nicole stood there, smiling sweetly. "Sis, I came to tell you the truth."
###Chapter 94: She Bore All the Filth Alone

"What truth?" Susan Thompson regretted asking the moment the words left her lips. There was only one truth—the truth about Bella Quinn's death.

Nicole Capra entered uninvited, settling gracefully onto the sofa. "The truth about Bella Quinn's suicide."

"Susan, last night was too crowded. Now I can tell you everything." Her cold smile widened as she glanced at the phone on the coffee table, confirming it wasn't recording.

"Those four men were specially arranged for Bella by Michelle and me."

"We watched as they tortured her to death."

Nicole smoothed her skirt with deliberate slowness. "Those beasts told us Bella jumped into the sea in utter humiliation. Do you know what we instructed them to do?"

She leaned close, whispering into Susan's ear, "I said—make sure not a single inch of her skin remains untouched."

Susan's nails dug deep into her palms.

"The blood on the cliff was all hers." Nicole's sweet laughter filled the room. "Can you imagine how brutal it must have been to leave that much blood behind?"

"Nicole!" Susan's eyes burned red, her entire body trembling.

"I told you this because I wanted to see you suffer." Nicole rose, looking down at her with icy satisfaction. "Your pain brings me joy."

Susan lunged, but Nicole easily shoved her to the ground. The agony in her stomach left her too weak to rise.

"With a body like yours, you should hurry and join your dead son." Nicole pressed her shoe against Susan's face. "If you take too long, I’d be happy to help."

The door slammed shut. Susan curled into herself, blood trickling from her lips.

She remembered Bella once asking, "Susan, what do you think is the most important thing in life?"

Back then, she had answered, "Happiness." But Bella had said, "Purity. To come into this world pure, and leave it the same way."

That reserved girl had only ever wanted to give herself to the one she loved. Yet in her most vulnerable moment, she had been defiled by filthy beasts.

Trembling, Susan reached for her phone and dialed Andrew Lucas.

"What is it?" His voice was cold.

"You promised to clear Bella's name."

"Only if you satisfy me." He scoffed. "And you’ve been anything but satisfying."

Susan clenched her teeth. "What do you want?"

"Nine tonight. Room 2208, A Variety of Beauties." The call ended abruptly.

Susan knew what that meant. But for Bella to leave this world pure, she swallowed her painkillers, wrapped herself in her coat, and stepped out.

The winter wind cut like knives. She stood shivering outside the upscale club.

When she pushed open the door, she finally understood Andrew's intention—

Ethan Sullivan was waiting inside the private room.
###Chapter 95: Andrew Lucas is History

He clearly intended to humiliate Susan in front of Ethan Sullivan.

Susan's eyes instantly reddened. Andrew Lucas always knew how to push her to the brink of embarrassment.

She could endure it from others. But Ethan was different—he genuinely cared for her. Being humiliated by Andrew in front of him felt like losing all dignity before family.

She turned to leave, but Ethan grabbed her wrist.

"Susan!" His eyes sparkled. "I was just looking for you!"

He affectionately took her hand. "We're so in sync."

"Hmph." Andrew let out a cold laugh, his gaze darkening ominously.

Susan stiffened, bracing for whatever cruel words might follow.

"The Goddess of Luo?!"

A surprised exclamation came from inside the private room. Susan turned to see the foreign man she'd met at Elegant Art.

Torey Smith waved excitedly. "I'm your biggest fan! Your dancing is breathtaking!"

Ethan proudly wrapped an arm around Susan's shoulders. "Finally, someone with taste!"

His eyes suddenly lit up. "Torey, how about giving Susan an audition?"

Torey immediately adopted a professional demeanor, studying Susan carefully. "Her look fits, but I need to see her acting. Come for the audition tomorrow—I'll judge fairly."

Susan was baffled. In her current condition, how could she possibly film anything?

"Wait," Torey frowned. "You said 'your Susan'? I thought the Goddess of Luo was with—"

"What?" Ethan cut him off casually. "Can't our Susan have an ex-boyfriend?"

The words "ex-boyfriend" stabbed at Andrew's heart like a knife.

Torey suddenly understood and patted Andrew sympathetically. "Andrew, you really missed out. Such a beauty, and Ethan snatched her up."

He raised his glass. "Ethan, may you grow old together!"

Andrew's expression darkened dangerously, his fists clenching audibly.

Oblivious, Torey continued fueling the fire. "By the way Andrew, isn't your current girlfriend Nicole Capra? That award-winning actress. Honestly, your taste—"

"Torey." Andrew's icy tone cut through the air.

Torey wisely changed the subject. "Nicole's also coming for the audition tomorrow. I'm curious—who's the better actress, her or Susan?"

He grinned proudly at Susan. "Did I use that idiom correctly?"

Susan forced a smile. "Perfectly."

Encouraged, Torey poured two more drinks. "To the Goddess of Luo's success tomorrow!"

He downed his glass. As Susan raised hers for a token sip, Ethan intercepted it.

"Making my woman drink?" Ethan drained the glass in one gulp. "Torey, do I not exist?"
###Chapter 96: He Knelt for Her

Torey smacked his forehead in frustration. "Ethan, my bad! How could I make a lady drink!"

He downed his glass in one gulp. "My beautiful goddess, I punish myself with this drink!"

Ethan Sullivan set down his glass, the playful glint in his eyes fading. His gaze deepened as he stared at Susan. "Susan, you never have to force yourself in front of me."

Andrew Lucas's knuckles turned white as he glared at the glass.

They'd indirectly kissed again.

What infuriated him more was Ethan's words—a real man never lets the woman he loves drink. Yet he had once forced Susan to toast with clients.

"Andrew! Your hand!" Torey's shocked cry shattered the silence.

Andrew looked down to find the stemware shattered in his grip, blood dripping from his palm.

Torey pried his fingers open in alarm. "God! Do all you Eastern men enjoy self-harm? Bruce did the same thing at noon!"

"Want to try?" Andrew coldly pressed a shard into Torey's hand.

Torey flung it away. "Andrew, you'll scare off every woman like this!"

Leaning back on the sofa, Andrew radiated icy hostility. "Ethan, do you really think she came here for you?"

Susan's heart clenched.

"Speak!" Andrew's sharp gaze pierced her. "Why did you come to A Variety of Beauties?"

She bit her lip hard enough to draw blood but lifted her chin defiantly. "Mr. Lucas, I'm asking you to testify for Bella."

"Asking?" Andrew sneered. "Then show me the attitude of someone begging."

Memories flooded in—

"Andrew, I want ice cream~"
"Sweetheart, not during your period."
"Please?"
"What's good for you doesn't require begging. What's bad for you, no amount of begging will change."

The tenderness of the past became today's blade. Susan turned her face away, forcing back tears.

"Unwilling?" Andrew's voice was glacial. "This is your last chance."

Torey tried mediating. "Andrew, be the bigger man after a breakup—"

"I beg you." Ethan's sudden declaration cut through the tension. He gripped Susan's trembling hand and dropped to one knee. "Andrew, I'm begging you—Ethan Sullivan begs you to testify for Bella Quinn."

Susan stared at him in shock. This proud man was kneeling for her.

Tears blurred her vision. This debt of gratitude, she could never repay.

Andrew's face darkened. He scrutinized Susan, trying to discern what magic this woman possessed to make Ethan bow his head.

"Now. Is this sincere enough?"
###Chapter 97: Crimson Dusk

Ethan Sullivan's lips curved into a smile, radiant as sunlight without a trace of shadow.

He knelt on one knee, his spine straight and proud—still every bit the spirited second son of the Sullivan family.

"Ethan, get up!"

Susan Thompson couldn't hold back any longer. She rushed forward to grab his arm. "Don't do this... I'm not worth it..."

"Susan," Ethan gently wiped the tears from the corner of her eye. "If Bella Quinn leaves with injustice hanging over her, you'll be heartbroken."

He tilted his head and made a silly face. "Keep crying and you'll turn into an ugly monster!"

Susan laughed through her tears.

"Andrew," Ethan turned to Andrew Lucas. "For the sake of our years of brotherhood, testify for Bella Quinn."

Andrew's knuckles turned white, his gaze locked on their intertwined hands.

"Fine," he ground out through clenched teeth.

Ethan immediately sprang to his feet, winking at Susan. "Feel better now?"

"Thank you..."

"Really want to thank me?" Ethan suddenly leaned close to her ear. "Then give me a kiss."

Andrew's eyes turned to ice.

Torey Smith rubbed his arms in protest. "Save the PDA for somewhere else!"

"We'll continue at home," Ethan slung an arm around Susan's shoulders and led her out.

In the hallway, Susan gently pulled away from his embrace. Ethan smiled carelessly, but a flicker of loneliness flashed in his eyes.

They decided to go grocery shopping.

"Susan, that commercial would be perfect for you," Ethan coaxed as they walked.

"I can't act..."

"You don't need to do anything," Ethan looked at her earnestly. "Just be yourself."

Susan opened her mouth to reply when suddenly her pupils contracted.

A black minivan was speeding straight toward them.

"Ethan, look out!"

In a split second, Ethan shoved her aside.

Amid the screech of brakes, his body was flung into the air before crashing heavily to the ground.

Blood bloomed beneath the sunset, a blinding crimson.
###Chapter 98: A Promise at Death's Door

"Ethan Sullivan!" Susan Thompson's scream pierced the air.

She watched in horror as the minivan slammed into Ethan, sending him flying. Her entire body turned to ice.

Even worse, the minivan reversed, preparing to run him over again.

At the critical moment, a black Koenigsegg sped around the corner. The minivan driver immediately accelerated and fled.

Susan staggered toward Ethan's bleeding body, her vision filled with nothing but blinding crimson.

The scene felt eerily familiar.

Just like when Nicole Capra had orchestrated Louis Lynch's hit-and-run.

"Ethan..." Susan dropped to her knees beside him, hands hovering helplessly.

His white shirt was soaked in blood, his face pale as parchment.

"Susan..." Ethan forced his eyes open, managing a weak smile. "Don't cry..."

She bit her lip hard, but tears streamed down uncontrollably.

"The ambulance is coming." Andrew Lucas stood nearby, phone pressed to his ear, his expression dark.

Ethan's breathing grew shallower. He tried lifting his hand, but it fell limply.

Susan immediately caught it, pressing his palm against her cheek.

"Ethan, hold on," she pleaded, voice trembling. "You promised to take me to see the northern lights."

His lashes fluttered. His whisper was barely audible. "Susan... promise me something..."

"Anything!" she blurted without hesitation.

"If I survive..." Each word cost him tremendous effort. "Marry me... okay?"

Her tears splashed onto his face. "Yes! I'll marry you!"

Andrew's fists clenched until his knuckles turned white.

"Really?" A faint light sparked in Ethan's eyes.

"Really!" Susan nodded fiercely. "Once you recover, we'll get married!"

Ethan closed his eyes, contentment softening his features.

"Ethan?" Panic seized her. "Don't fall asleep—please!"

She pressed a kiss to his forehead, but couldn't feel his breath.

"Andrew!" she cried desperately. "Check him!"

Andrew crouched down, fingers shaking as he felt for Ethan's pulse.

"He's still alive," he rasped. "The ambulance is almost here."

Finally, sirens wailed in the distance.

Susan clung to Ethan's hand, vision blurred. "Ethan, do you hear that? Help is coming..."

"You promised to teach me perfumery," she choked out. "You can't break your word..."

"I agreed to marry you. You have to... you have to live to make me your wife."

Andrew stood rigidly nearby, face stormy.

His gaze shifted between Susan's tear-streaked face and his critically injured friend. A boulder seemed to crush his chest.

Paramedics arrived and swiftly loaded Ethan onto a stretcher.

Susan stumbled after them, murmuring, "Ethan, I'll wait... I'll wear a wedding dress for you..."

Her voice faded into silent sobs.

Andrew remained rooted in place, watching the ambulance disappear. His fists remained clenched.

He pulled out his phone and dialed. "Track down that minivan. Now."
###Chapter 99: Susan's True Husband

The doctor rushed over, his brow furrowing at the sight of Ethan Sullivan's injuries.

Susan Thompson clenched her fists so tightly her nails dug into her palms. She wanted to ask about his condition but feared interrupting the treatment, so she bit her lip hard.

The ambulance sped to the hospital, and Ethan was immediately wheeled into surgery.

As the red emergency light flickered on, Susan leaned against the cold hospital wall. The scene felt hauntingly familiar—just like when Daniel had been hospitalized.

Andrew Lucas stood a short distance away, his gaze dark and fixed on her.

"Susan!" He suddenly charged forward, gripping her shoulders. "You still want to marry him?"

She slowly lifted her eyes, her expression hollow. "Yes. I'm marrying Ethan Sullivan."

"Say that again."

"I said," she enunciated each word, "I'm marrying the second young master of the Sullivan family."

Andrew's fingers tightened, his knuckles turning white. "Susan, how dare you!"

"Why wouldn't I dare?" She let out a soft, bitter laugh. "Mr. Lucas, who do you think you are?"

"Don't forget your place!"

"A mistress?" She tilted her head. "Go ahead and sue me over that contract. I don’t care anymore."

His pupils constricted.

"The first time I ever wore a wedding dress in my life was for Ethan." Her voice was feather-light. "He is my husband."

"You mean nothing to me anymore."

Andrew slammed her against the wall, his breathing ragged.

Susan stared blankly at the ceiling, faintly recalling a vow from years past.

"Andrew, in my next life, I'd rather marry a beggar than be your bride again."

The sharp click of heels echoed down the hallway.

"Sister!" Nicole Capra rushed forward. "What did you do to Ethan?"

Susan smirked coldly.

"Andrew..." Nicole's tears fell like petals. "Why would she do this to me?"

Andrew patted her back soothingly.

Then Susan moved.

She yanked Nicole to the ground and kicked her hard. "This is for Daniel!"

Another kick. "This is for Bella!"

And another. "This is for Ethan!"

Nicole shrieked, curling into a ball.

Andrew lunged forward in fury but was blocked by arriving security.

Just then, the operating room doors swung open.

"The patient needs a blood transfusion. Who’s family?"

Susan stumbled forward. "I'm his fiancée!"

Andrew's face turned ashen.
###Chapter 100 Nicole Capra Gets Beaten Beyond Recognition!

Susan Thompson's foot connected brutally with Nicole Capra's face.

She realized punching Nicole always gave her an indescribable thrill.

"Have you lost your mind, Susan?" Nicole covered her face, summoning tears on command. "What did I even do to deserve this?"

Susan smirked.

The fake innocent act was starting again.

If Nicole loved performing so much, she'd give her a show to remember.

Susan's gaze landed on the steel trash can in the corner.

Before Andrew Lucas could react, she grabbed it and swung with full force at Nicole's head.

"Thud!"

Nicole collapsed instantly, blood trickling from her forehead.

The trash can lid flew open, dumping its contents onto her body.

Banana peels, apple cores, used tissues, even sticky phlegm.

A putrid stench filled the air instantly.

Nicole had only meant to play victim for sympathy, never expecting Susan's brutality.

"Andrew!" she shrieked. "She's trying to kill me!"

Andrew finally snapped out of his daze.

His nose wrinkled at the sight of Nicole covered in garbage.

"Apologize, Susan," he commanded coldly.

Susan curled her lips. "Apologize? After I'm done teaching her a lesson!"

She raised the trash can again.

Nicole's eyes widened in disbelief.

"Crash!"

The remaining garbage cascaded onto her head.

Nicole trembled with rage.

She longed to claw Susan's eyes out, but had to maintain her fragile facade for Andrew.

"Andrew, it hurts..." She sobbed, lunging toward him.

"Thump!"

She hit the floor hard, her head smacking against the wall.

Andrew had instinctively stepped aside.

The smell was unbearable.

His germaphobia kicked in.

Yet strangely, he'd never minded Susan's messes.

He still remembered holding her all night four years ago when she'd vomited on him drunk.

"Andrew..." Nicole wailed louder. "I'm so filthy..."

Andrew wanted to comfort her, but couldn't bring himself to touch her.

Susan had no patience for their drama.

Her only concern was Ethan Sullivan in the emergency room.

"Andrew," Nicole sniffled. "Make her leave the hospital. She hurt my mother and brother..."

Andrew nodded curtly. "Fine."

He didn't want Susan near Ethan.

Susan's head snapped up. "You're the one who should leave!"

She locked eyes with Andrew. "Ethan was deliberately attacked. I'll ask you one last time—"

"Do you believe Nicole hired those killers?"
###Chapter 101: Susan, How Do You Want Ethan to Die?

"Susan, Ethan is Nicole's younger brother!" Andrew Lucas's voice was icy.

"Mr. Lucas, Ethan got hit saving me!" Susan Thompson's nails dug into her palms. "Nicole tried to kill me!"

"Ridiculous!" Andrew grabbed her chin. "Nicole would never do that!"

Susan suddenly laughed.

A bitter, mocking laugh.

In his eyes, Nicole would always be the pure white lily. While she, Susan, would forever remain the venomous liar.

"Sister, how could you do this to Ethan?" Nicole Capra rushed over with reddened eyes. "He got hurt because of you—"

She turned abruptly to the bodyguards. "Throw her out! Ethan doesn't want to see her!"

Four black-suited bodyguards seized Susan.

"Let me go!" Susan struggled desperately. "Nicole, I hope you rot in hell!"

Her gaze pierced through the crowd, locked onto the operating room doors.

They opened.

A doctor emerged saying something, but she was already being dragged into the elevator. The words were lost.

Outside the hospital entrance, bodyguards stood like iron sentinels.

"Let me in!" Susan stumbled forward. "Just one look—"

She was shoved violently to the ground.

Blood sprayed across her lashes, blurring her vision.

Underground parking garage.

Susan leaned against the wall, each step like walking on knives.

Finally reaching the patient floor.

Nicole stood by the doorway, her freshly washed curls still dripping.

"My, aren't you persistent." Her smile was venomous. "Pity..."

"Move!" Susan reached for the door.

Two bodyguards instantly shielded Nicole.

"Andrew's men." Nicole waved her phone triumphantly. "He doesn't want you finishing Ethan off either."

"Toss her out." The order came lightly.

Susan was dragged roughly to the stairwell and thrown down.

Nicole's stiletto pressed into her stomach.

"Hurts?" She bent down, red lips nearly touching Susan's ear. "This is just the beginning."

"What... do you want?"

"If Ethan wakes up, he'll believe your lies." Nicole's nail traced Susan's cheek. "So..."

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "He'll never wake up."

"You're insane! He's your brother!"

"Hah." A cold laugh. "I killed our mother. What's a brother to me?"

She yanked Susan's hair. "Let's make a deal. Tell me... how do you want Ethan Sullivan to die?"
###Chapter 102: Crimson Attire for Love, A Vow Beyond Life

"Nicole Capra, what the hell are you trying to do?"

A sinister smile curled at Nicole's lips. "Susan Thompson, I'm merely asking for your opinion. Tell me, how should I send Ethan Sullivan to his grave? Drug injection? Surgical accident? Or... should I make him bleed out right before your eyes?"

Susan trembled violently. "Don't you dare touch him! Come at me if you have the guts!"

Nicole's stiletto pressed cruelly against Susan's chest. "Killing you outright would be too boring. I want you to watch everyone you care about disappear, one by one."

"You're insane!" Susan struggled helplessly.

Nicole's phone suddenly rang. She answered impatiently, then paled.

"Andrew Lucas is back? With Nathan Foster?" She gritted her teeth and hung up. "Lucky you."

Susan exhaled in relief. With Andrew here, Ethan was safe—for now.

After Nicole stormed off, Susan leaned against the wall, struggling to stand. She glanced toward the hospital room and whispered, "Ethan, please get better soon."

The audition was held on the top floor of Sullivan Tower.

Susan wore light makeup, her bruises expertly concealed. When she entered, all eyes turned to her.

Nicole scoffed. "An extra dares to compete for the endorsement?"

Candy Wilson stood beside Vincent King, radiating confidence. Andrew appeared to accompany Nicole, yet his gaze never left Susan.

The audition required performing a tragic love story: an innocent girl loses her family, transforms into a vengeful seductress, and ultimately sacrifices herself for love.

When Susan's turn came, she discovered her prepared heels were broken.

"What happened?" a staff member panicked. "These were the last backup pair."

Susan took a deep breath. "It's fine. I'll perform barefoot."

As the music began, she stepped onto the stage, her bare feet meeting the cold floor. The crimson gown swirled with every turn, each movement carrying desperate beauty.

When the scene called for dancing with her lover's lifeless body, Ethan's face flashed before Susan's eyes. Silent tears fell as she spun like a phoenix rising from flames.

The final note faded. The room fell silent.

Suddenly, the doors burst open. Ethan staggered in, covered in blood. "Susan, stop! There are needles in the shoes!"

She looked down. Her feet were already stained red. The broken heels had concealed razor-thin silver needles.

"Ethan..." Darkness swallowed her vision as she collapsed into familiar arms.

Ethan held her tightly, roaring at the stunned crowd, "Who did this?!"

Nicole turned pale, backing away. Andrew blocked her path. "Care to explain, Nicole?"

Chaos erupted. Before losing consciousness, Susan heard Ethan whisper, "This time, I'll protect you."
###Chapter 103: The Enchanting Dance

The silver high heels appeared flawless, showing no signs of tampering. But the moment Susan Thompson took her first step, the heel snapped without warning.

Her body swayed, but years of dance training gave her the flexibility and reflexes to quickly regain balance. A sharp pain shot through her ankle, though thankfully no sprain occurred.

Equipment provided by Capra Group for auditions would never have quality issues. Someone had clearly sabotaged these shoes.

Susan couldn't be bothered whether it was Candy Wilson or Nicole Capra behind this. The immediate problem was finding replacement footwear.

Each audition participant received custom costumes and shoes. Susan considered borrowing from other actresses, but her feet were unusually small - not even a size 35. The smallest available was size 38, completely unsuitable.

When her turn came, Susan decisively discarded the broken heels. Bare feet were better than ill-fitting shoes.

Nicole and Candy's performances earned praise from the judges, but Director Torey Smith remained unsatisfied. He sought something extraordinary, not merely competent.

When Susan stepped onto the stage barefoot, Torey's eyes lit up.

Her makeup wasn't heavy, yet she perfectly embodied the seductive charm of the imperial concubine. No exaggerated eyeliner or dark eyeshadow needed - her mere presence radiated the allure that could topple kingdoms.

Innocence and sensuality blended seamlessly in her. Every smile and glance held mesmerizing power.

Torey nodded inwardly. This was how a true femme fatale should be - not through cosmetic darkness, but innate, lethal magnetism.

Clutching the prop pillow, Susan recalled the script's scene where the concubine dances for her beloved. The pillow should have looked ridiculous, but thoughts of Ethan Sullivan - still comatose after saving her - brought a pang of sorrow.

As music began, she raised her flowing sleeves, bare feet lightly touching the stage. Pain flared from her back wounds, but remembering Ethan's wish to see her shine, she gritted her teeth and danced with increasing grace.

Her delicate feet gleamed like jade under the lights. The audience held their breath, eyes tracking her every movement.

Vincent King knew he shouldn't stare, yet couldn't look away from those perfect feet. He even considered covering them with his jacket to hide them from others.

Seeing this, Candy dug her nails into her palms. She pressed against Vincent, cooing, "Vinny..."

Vincent remained oblivious, gaze fixed on the stage. Andrew Lucas witnessed this, fury igniting in his eyes.

That wanton woman dared seduce so openly! Andrew clenched his fists, barely restraining himself from dragging her offstage.

At the dance's climax, Susan became one with her role. Clutching the pillow, tears glistened as she choked out, "Ethan, I'll marry you! Just wake up and I'll marry you! Together in life, united in death!"

These scripted lines became her heartfelt vow.

Andrew's aura turned glacial. What did she say? Marry whom? United even in death?

The set fell utterly silent, everyone stunned by this unexpected declaration. Only Candy's face darkened with barely contained rage.
###Chapter 104: Hands Off Another Man's Woman

Andrew Lucas radiated icy hostility, yet couldn't dampen the thunderous applause filling the venue.

The judges' panel erupted in continuous praise.

Those who had moments ago lavished compliments on Nicole Capra and Candy Wilson now unanimously favored Susan Thompson's performance.

Candy's sweet features clashed jarringly with the seductive femme fatale role.

Though Nicole's appearance somewhat fit the part, her stiff dance moves fell far short of embodying a devastating beauty.

Susan's minor flubbed line became insignificant.

She had channeled the enchantress's allure to perfection.

Torey Smith charged onto the stage and engulfed Susan in a bear hug.

"Perfect! Goddess Luo, you're the enchantress I envisioned! After this commercial airs, you'll haunt every man's dreams!"

"Yes! That bewitching aura! It steals men's breath!"

Susan gasped for air in his crushing embrace.

Two icy voices snapped simultaneously: "Release her."

Andrew and Vincent King had materialized onstage.

"Vincent..." Candy's eyes reddened with hurt.

Vincent startled awake from his trance.

He'd nearly drawn his blade to sever Torey's offending hands.

Masking his lapse, he descended the platform stone-faced.

"Vincent...do you...have feelings for Susan?" Candy bit her quivering lip. "If you do, I'll step aside—"

Blood-drenched memories flashed before Vincent's eyes.

The small hands that had pulled him from death's brink belonged to Candy.

He yanked her into his arms. "I only want you, Candy. Susan means nothing to me."

As if convincing himself, he repeated: "Absolutely nothing."

When Torey finally released Susan, only Andrew's stormy expression greeted him.

"Andrew, you're right! Hands off another man's woman!" Torey retreated with an awkward chuckle.

The phrase darkened Andrew's glare further.

He knew Torey referred to Ethan Sullivan.

"Goddess Luo, you embody my vision! Only you can portray this enchantress!"

Susan flushed at the effusive praise.

"I should personally thank Ethan for this opportunity." Her eyes softened mentioning him. "He's the one who recommended me for the audition."

Andrew seized her wrist violently.

"Susan, must you parade your charms before every man? This commercial shoot is canceled."

"Andrew!" Torey interjected. "This is art! Don't insult artistic expression!"

"Letting her perform would defile art!"

"Harassing your ex makes you less than a man!" Torey dared to counter.

Andrew's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Repeat that."

Torey instantly cowered. "I said nothing..."

"Withdraw from the audition," Andrew commanded.

The thought of countless men fantasizing over Susan's images set his blood boiling.

Torey gulped but stood firm. "Ethan granted me full authority over casting decisions!"

"Petty revenge after being dumped? That's pathological—"

"Torey!"

The director promptly silenced himself.

Nicole seized the moment to cling to Andrew's arm. "Andrew, I have a compromise..."
###Chapter 105: Her Ultimate Downfall

"What's the plan?" Torey narrowed his eyes.

Nicole gracefully tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, her red lips curling into a scheming smile.

"Let Susan be my dance double. She'll perform the moves while I show my face."

She had to admit—Susan's dancing was breathtaking. If she could use those skills to enhance her own image, this endorsement deal would be even more spectacular.

After all, the audience would only remember her face.

Torey studied her in silence, his gaze lingering.

Nicole pressed her advantage. "My popularity and body of work have already proven marketable. Using a newcomer is too risky."

She lifted her chin confidently, waiting for his surrender.

Torey suddenly let out a derisive laugh.

"Miss Capra, do you think I'm blind? Why would I choose you when I have Susan, who dances like a goddess?"

Nicole's face twisted.

"You—"

"Just stating facts." Torey shrugged. "With Susan here, I'd never settle for second best."

Second best?!

Her nails dug into her palms. She was widely recognized as a beauty—how dare this foreigner insult her like this!

"Andrew..." She turned to him with wounded eyes.

"You're beautiful," Andrew said flatly, but his gaze remained locked on Susan.

The words pierced Susan's heart.

True beauty wasn't about appearance—it was about the way the one you loved looked at you.

"I'll go prepare the contract," she murmured before hurrying away, her slender frame disappearing down the hall.

Nicole leaned against Andrew's shoulder, venom flashing in her eyes.

If she couldn't take it by force...

Then she'd destroy Susan instead.

Susan carried a bouquet of daisies to the cemetery.

"Happy birthday, Bella," she whispered, brushing her fingers over the photo on the tombstone.

The girl in the picture smiled brilliantly, forever frozen at twenty-two.

"I'm sorry I haven't gotten justice for you yet."

A cold wind tugged at her coat as four hulking men suddenly blocked her path.

Susan's pupils contracted.

It was them—the monsters from that night.
###Chapter 106: Desperate Cry for Help

Susan's nails dug deep into her palms, her knuckles turning white. She stared fixedly at the four leering men before her, her stomach churning.

Reason told her she couldn't fight them head-on.

"Pretty thing, why'd you stop running?" The scar-faced leader swung his DSLR camera, lens pointed at her pale face. "Miss Capra's waiting for some exciting photos of you."

Susan whirled around and bolted down a side path. Cold wind burned her throat, carrying the metallic taste of blood. She knew she couldn't outrun them, but she had to buy time.

The cemetery gates stood three hundred meters ahead.

"Damn bitch can run!" Crude shouts followed her. Susan stumbled, her knees slamming hard against stone steps. She fumbled for her phone, fingers trembling as she hit the speed dial.

"Andrew, help me..."

A cold laugh answered. "Susan, what game are you playing now?"

"I'm really—"

"Drop dead." The call ended abruptly.

The camera smashed into her face. The taste of iron filled her mouth. Scar-face yanked her hair, dragging her toward the trees. "Miss Capra wants photos of you getting gang-raped. We'll give you a good time."

"Wait!" Susan suddenly smiled. "How much is Nicole paying you? I'll triple it."

The men exchanged glances. Scar-face loosened his grip. "You got five million?"

"I need my phone to transfer it." She pointed to the shattered device in the distance. "Why not send one guy with me to get cash?"

Bright licked his lips, stepping closer. "Boss, she's hotter than Bella Quinn. Let's—"

"Idiot!" Scar-face backhanded him. "Money first!"

Susan's fingers closed around the razor blade hidden in her boot. As Scar-face bent to grab her, she pressed the sharp edge to his throat.

"Don't move!" Her voice was raw. "Or I slit his windpipe!"

Sirens wailed in the distance. The men paled. Susan shoved Scar-face into his companions and sprinted for the cemetery gates.

Police lights cut through the twilight. As Susan collapsed before the officers, furious shouts followed her. "You bitch! Miss Capra won't let this go!"

Her shattered phone lay on the ground, screen still displaying Andrew's contact. Something cold trailed down her cheek—blood or tears, she couldn't tell.
###Chapter 107: Cage of Darkness

Cold moonlight filtered through the cracks of the wooden cabin, casting mottled shadows across Susan Thompson's face. She stared at the four men before her, their twisted expressions making her stomach churn with pain so intense it nearly suffocated her.

"Miss Capra wants these photos to be spectacular," Monkey grinned, revealing yellowed teeth. "Don't you agree?"

Susan dug her nails deep into her palms. She knew exactly what they intended—once those photos were leaked, she'd never be able to hold her head up again.

"You'll pay for this," she rasped, her voice like a curse dragged from the depths of hell.

Bright suddenly burst into laughter, the sound grating in the hollow cabin. "Pay for it? Bella Quinn said the same thing before she jumped into the sea!" He yanked open Susan's coat. "Too bad we're still doing just fine."

Susan trembled—not from cold, but from overwhelming hatred. She saw Howie adjusting the DSLR camera, its lens aimed at her like a greedy, unblinking eye.

"Don't touch me!" She lashed out with a kick toward Monkey's groin, but Hammer seized her leg.

"Stay still!" Hammer backhanded her across the face. Blood welled at the corner of Susan's lips. The metallic taste filled her mouth, yet she smiled. "Is that all you've got?"

Enraged, Monkey tore open her collar. The shutter clicked repeatedly, each sound like a knife carving into Susan's heart.

"Make sure her face is clear!" Bright commanded excitedly.

Susan went still. Her gaze fixed on the frayed rope dangling from a ceiling beam, her eyes hardening with resolve. Better death than this humiliation—

"Thinking of dying?" Hammer caught her intention instantly, gripping her chin. "Miss Capra said you have to live long enough to see your photos in the papers!"

Agony blurred Susan's vision. The sound of fabric ripping. Cold air against exposed skin. Despair crashed over her like a tidal wave—until it froze abruptly.

An engine roared outside.

Everyone froze. No one should be in this wilderness.

"Check it out!" Monkey hastily pulled up his pants. Bright barely reached the door before it was kicked in, slamming into him with crushing force.

Moonlight outlined a tall figure stepping through the splintered wreckage. Susan couldn't see his face, but the men's terrified screams told her everything:

"It's... it's Andrew Lucas!"

Andrew stood in the doorway, his black trench coat billowing in the night wind. When his eyes landed on Susan, his pupils constricted violently.

The next moment, the cabin echoed with screams.

Susan curled in the corner, watching the man who'd once hurt her most now breaking each assailant limb by limb. She should feel relief. Instead, she tasted only bitter irony.

When the last thug collapsed unconscious, Andrew shrugged off his coat and wrapped it around her. The familiar scent of his cologne filled her senses. Susan laughed softly.

"Andrew," her voice was feather-light, "you're too late."

His body stiffened. Susan seized the moment to shove him away, staggering to her feet. Clutching the coat tightly, she stared at the four unconscious men, dark flames igniting in her eyes.

"These people," she enunciated each word, "I'll deal with them myself."

Lightning split the sky outside. The stark white glare illuminated Susan's face—the tear tracks still fresh, the icy smile etched on her lips.
###Chapter 108: Obsessed with Her, Never Parting in Life or Death

"Bitch! Let go!"

Hammer's eyes burned with fury as he saw his companion's arm mangled by teeth. He swung his arm in a wide arc, delivering a brutal slap. Susan Thompson's cheek swelled instantly, yet she kept her jaws locked on Monkey's arm.

Her eyes blazed with insane hatred, as if she wanted to tear the flesh clean off the bone.

"Ah—!" Monkey's face twisted in agony. He wanted to strike back but couldn't even lift his hand.

Susan wanted to demand they delete the photos, but she didn't dare loosen her bite. The metallic taste of blood filled her throat, driving her to clamp down harder.

She had always despised violence, yet now she reveled in the thrill of vengeance.

Nicole Capra, you'd better pray I die here!

If I make it out alive, I'll make sure you suffer worse than death!

"Madwoman! You're insane!" Monkey hopped in pain while his flustered accomplice scrambled for something to pry her mouth open.

Suddenly, Monkey let out a bloodcurdling scream.

A chunk of flesh slid from the corner of Susan's lips.

She had actually bitten off a piece of Monkey's arm!

"I'll kill you!" Enraged, Monkey grabbed his Swiss army knife, only for Hammer to yank him back.

"What about the two million?" Hammer hissed under his breath.

Conflict flickered in Monkey's eyes before he settled on glaring at Susan. "You'll pay for this later!"

Susan smirked and spat the bloody flesh out the window.

She wasn't afraid of death—did he really think threats would work?

The taunt sent Monkey into a frenzy. He tore open his shirt, ready to lunge. "I'll make you beg for mercy!"

"Ah!" The searing pain from his wound sent him crumpling to the floor.

"Finish her!" Monkey snarled, pointing at Susan.

Hammer stuffed a filthy rag into her mouth. Exhausted, Susan collapsed onto the bed like a broken doll.

But she didn't regret it.

At least she'd had her moment of defiance.

The relentless shutter clicks of the camera told her exactly how degrading those photos would be.

Yet she was powerless to stop it.

In that moment, she finally understood why Bella Quinn had chosen death.

The wooden door burst open with a crash.

Vincent King stood silhouetted against the light, radiating murderous rage.

For a fleeting second, Susan thought she'd been transported back to the dungeon days.

The Vincent who would protect her had returned.

She watched as he kicked Bright across the room and wrested the knife from Monkey's grip. The thugs fled in panic, abandoning even their camera.

Susan's eyelids grew heavier.

She wished this were all just a nightmare.

When she woke, Daniel would call her "Mommy" in that sweet voice. Vincent would tousle her hair gently. Bella would smile and link arms with her.

"Susan!"

Vincent tore the bloodied rag from her mouth, wrapped his coat around her battered body, and crushed her against his chest.

Reason told him to stay away from this woman.

But right now, all he wanted was to fuse her into his very bones—never to let go.
###Chapter 109: Susan Is Vincent's Mistress

Vincent's fingers trembled slightly.

He never expected to encounter Susan in such a place. The chilly night breeze in the suburbs scattered the last shred of his rationality.

The screech of brakes shattered the silence.

A stray cat darting across the road had saved her. Vincent stared at the lone sneaker by the roadside, his pupils constricting abruptly.

He remembered.

Susan had worn those shoes during her audition that morning. The small size, as delicate as she was.

An unmarked black sedan idled nearby.

Vincent's temple throbbed. He snatched up the shoe and charged toward the cabin, kicking the door open—only for his blood to run cold.

Several men surrounded Susan.

"Get out!" His voice was sharper than a blade.

The intruders fled in panic. Only then did Vincent notice Susan's condition—her unfocused gaze, the unnatural flush on her cheeks.

"Susan?"

No response.

He bent to retrieve the discarded shoe. Her ankle was startlingly slender, her sole pale as jade. His Adam's apple bobbed involuntarily.

The moment his fingers brushed her skin, Susan flinched.

"Vincent, stop teasing..."

That whisper struck his heart like a hammer. Memories of the dungeon surged forth—days and nights spent relying on each other, finding joy in hardship.

She always lost their guessing games.

And she'd pout like this whenever he tickled her feet.

Vincent yanked her into his arms. Susan struggled dizzily, her small hands fumbling.

"Take that for bullying me..."

She mumbled, reaching to tickle his ribs—a secret only the closest would know.

Vincent's breath hitched.

"Susan, still refusing to give up?"

"Of course not!" she retorted indignantly, her fingers already at his shirt buttons.

The last thread of his restraint snapped.

Vincent flipped her beneath him, kissing her with desperate hunger. He conjured a thousand excuses, but none outweighed one truth—

He wanted her.

"I'll pay you," he panted against her ear. "But don't expect anything more."

The words doused her like ice water.

Susan jolted awake. Was this cold man truly the same Vincent who'd once vowed to protect her forever?

"Let go!"

Her shove earned a mocking laugh.

"Playing hard to get?" Vincent gripped her chin. "Remember your place. You'll always be mine—"

"Susan!"

Andrew's roar exploded from the doorway, laced with fury.

The air inside the cabin froze.
###Chapter 110: Who Gave You Permission to Touch Her!

"Bang!"

Andrew Lucas's fist struck Vincent King's handsome face with thunderous force. He grabbed Vincent by the collar and slammed him against the wooden table.

"Who gave you permission to touch her!"

Andrew's eyes burned crimson like an enraged beast. He delivered another backhanded blow, drawing blood from Vincent's lip.

Vincent wiped the blood from his mouth with deliberate grace, straightening his posture as a mocking glint flashed in his eyes.

"My woman. I'll touch her whenever I please. That's none of your concern, Andrew."

"Your woman?" Andrew's laugh was icy, his gaze freezing over.

His eyes caught the stark bloodstain on the bed's edge, his heart constricting violently. Had this woman really undergone that surgery again to please Vincent?

How laughable. He'd called in every favor, even owed his eldest brother a debt, just to find her. And what did he discover? Her entangled with Vincent in this remote cabin!

"Susan Thompson, you're quite the actress." Andrew's voice cut like a blade. "Selling yourself to me at Elegant Art, then climbing into Vincent's bed. How revolting."

Susan tightened her coat around herself, her face pale as paper.

She couldn't be bothered to explain. In this man's eyes, she'd always be nothing but a cheap whore.

"Think whatever you want, Mr. Lucas." Her voice was hoarse. "My affairs are none of your business."

"None of my business?" Andrew laughed in fury, reaching for her slender neck.

Vincent suddenly stepped between them, his gaze sharp. "That's enough, Andrew."

As tension crackled between the two men, Vincent's phone rang. His expression changed instantly when he saw the caller ID.

"Candy?"

Candy Wilson's weak sobs came through the line. "Vincent... I have a fever..."

Vincent ended the call hastily, throwing Susan a meaningful glance before leaving. "We'll continue this another time."

Silence reclaimed the cabin. Susan fought to stay conscious when Andrew suddenly gripped her chin.

"See that? To Vincent, you're not worth one of Candy's fingers." His voice dripped with cruel satisfaction. "Playing innocent won't help. You'll always be his dirty little secret."

Susan turned her face away, her voice feather-light. "That's still none of your concern, Mr. Lucas."

"Susan!"

Andrew kicked the ground in rage, his foot connecting with a black object—a Canon DSLR camera. The lens was shattered, but the memory card remained intact.

He bent to pick it up, a flicker of suspicion crossing his features.
###Chapter 111: Susan, Do You Love Vincent That Much?!

Andrew Lucas stared at the DSLR camera on the floor, his fingertips trembling slightly.

As he bent to pick it up, the screen was still illuminated.

A graphic photo assaulted his vision without warning.

Susan Thompson curled in the corner, watching the veins bulge suddenly on Andrew's forehead, her heart clenched by an invisible fist.

She knew exactly how vile those photos were.

Even after enduring countless insults of being "dirty," she still feared seeing disgust in his eyes.

But then she remembered—the Andrew who once cherished her was long dead.

The man before her now was a stranger.

Susan wanted to leave, but the pain immobilized her.

She could only close her eyes and brace for the coming storm.

Andrew glared at the photo.

He recognized those men instantly.

The murderers of Bella Quinn.

How could Susan, who cared so deeply for Bella, willingly take such photos?

The truth was obvious.

His heart felt slashed by a blade, but the thought of her throwing herself at Vincent King transformed the pain into raging fury.

Crash!

The DSLR shattered against the floor.

"Susan, do you love Vincent that much?!" His voice was glacial.

Too exhausted to explain, Susan remained silent.

Her silence ignited Andrew's wrath.

He ground the camera fragments under his heel, his expression terrifying.

"Imagine how disappointed Ethan would be if he saw you like this."

Susan's eyes flew open.

"You don't get to mention him!"

"Andrew, who I love is none of your business!"

"Stay out of my life from now on!" Her voice was hoarse. "You think I'm dirty? To me, you're worse!"

Andrew suddenly smirked.

He picked up the intact memory card, twirling it between his fingers.

"Wonder what Ethan would think seeing these?"

Susan's face drained of color.

She scrambled up, lunging for the card—

And missed.

"Give it back!"

Andrew had no intention of leaking the photos.

The mere thought of those men seeing her made him homicidal.

But her panic for someone else was unbearable.

"Afraid your innocent act will crumble?" He sneered. "Yet you seemed to enjoy it in the photos."

"You—" Susan trembled violently, shoving him. "Try being raped yourself! See if you'd enjoy it!"

Andrew froze.

Her defiance mirrored the girl from four years ago.

Seizing his hesitation, Susan staggered toward the door.

"Show them to whoever you want!"

"I'm done with your threats!"

Just as she reached the exit, a powerful arm slammed her against the door.

Andrew's eyes churned with a terrifying tempest.

"Susan, you're not escaping."
###Chapter 112: Andrew, I Refuse to Bear Your Child!

Susan's back pressed against the cold wall.

Andrew's gaze was like a poisoned dagger, scraping inch by inch across her skin. She knew that look too well. Whenever his expression darkened like this, she could predict exactly what would follow.

"Let me go!" She shoved against his chest with all her strength, nails digging deep into his flesh.

"Dream on." Andrew's冷笑 echoed as fabric撕裂 with a sharp sound in the silent room.

Susan bit down on her lower lip until she tasted blood. She hated her traitorous body—how it still trembled under his touch despite the hatred burning in her bones.

"Andrew, you bastard!" Her hand flew toward his face, but he easily caught her wrist and pinned it above her head.

When it was over, dusk had settled outside the window.

Susan slid to the floor like a broken doll, legs too weak to stand. She fumbled for her coat, wrapping it around her shaking body.

"Get back here!" Andrew's voice cut through the air behind her.

She ignored him, using the wall for support as she staggered toward the door. The winter wind sliced at her exposed skin, but she felt no pain.

The roar of a Koenigsegg engine approached, and suddenly she was swept off her feet.

"Dressed like that—who are you trying to seduce?" Andrew's voice simmered with suppressed rage.

Susan closed her eyes, too exhausted to argue.

The car stopped at Willow Lane villa. She stumbled toward the nightstand, fingers trembling as they closed around a pill bottle—only for Andrew to snatch it away.

"Afraid of carrying my child?" His grip on her chin threatened to crush bone.

Susan laughed then, so hard that tears streamed down her face.

"Yes. I'd rather bear a dog's pups than yours, Andrew Lucas!"

Her words detonated his fury. He threw her onto the bed, eyes blazing.

"Say that again!"

"I said I'd rather die than have your child!" She lifted her chin defiantly. "You don't deserve it."

Andrew's fist slammed into the pillow beside her head. As he glared at her pale face, he noticed blood trickling from the corner of her mouth.

"What's wrong?" His voice cracked unexpectedly.

Susan turned away, swallowing the metallic taste rising in her throat.

"None of your business."

Outside, the last sliver of sunset vanished into darkness. Just like the light between them—long extinguished.
###Chapter 113: The Urn of Young Master Sullivan

"Say that again, Susan."

Andrew Lucas's eyes burned with violent crimson, his knuckles cracking under pressure.

Yet Susan Thompson only smiled more bewitchingly, her red lips parting. "I'd rather bear a beggar's child than carry your seed again."

She was thrown violently onto the bed.

As his weight crushed her, she heard her bones protest with brittle snaps. The hatred in Andrew's gaze was tangible, like poisoned blades flaying her inch by inch.

That rainy night four years ago resurfaced. When she'd killed their child, blood had mingled with rainwater as it rolled down his forehead, stealing his last shred of warmth.

"Hah."

Just as Susan thought she'd suffocate, Andrew suddenly laughed coldly.

"Susan, do you even deserve it?"

A wad of cash struck her face, the sharp edges slicing her cheek.

"Remember to take the pill." Andrew adjusted his cuffs with aristocratic calm, as if his earlier fury had been an illusion. "If you dare get pregnant—"

He leaned down, whispering demonically in her ear, "I'll strangle it with my own hands."

The door slammed shut with thunderous force.

Susan stared at the ceiling with a hollow laugh. Her body, ravaged by late-stage stomach cancer, had long lost the ability to conceive. The blood-red bills lay over her like fallen leaves—she couldn't be bothered to brush them away.

In the depths of pain, darkness became her only solace.

......

Outside the apartment, Andrew snapped a memory card in half.

The filthy images burned behind his temples. Only after grinding the fragments to dust did he call his assistant.

"Clean this up."

Four words—a death sentence.

......

Her new phone had barely powered on when an unknown number flashed across the screen.

"Miss Thompson, it's Nathan Foster."

At the voice of Ethan Sullivan's assistant, Susan's fingers trembled.

"Young Master Sullivan... passed this morning."

A stifled sob traveled through the receiver. "His last wish was for you to live well."

The phone clattered to the floor.

By the time Susan staggered into the hospital, the VIP room stood empty. A nurse was changing the sheets, the blinding white fabric searing her eyes.

"Where is he? Where's Ethan Sullivan?"

She gripped the nurse's wrist, nails digging deep. The nurse gasped in pain. "He was taken to the funeral home at dawn..."

The words "funeral home" exploded in her ears.

Susan knocked over an IV stand as she whirled around. Amid the shattering glass, a familiar figure appeared at the end of the hallway—

Nathan Foster approached, cradling a black ebony urn, his eyes red-rimmed.
###Chapter 114: Consuming Hatred

"Mr. Sullivan?" The nurse changing the sheets didn't look up, her tone indifferent.

"Yes! Is he out of danger?" Susan Thompson pressed urgently.

"Mr. Sullivan has been discharged," another nurse answered with an impatient glance.

Susan's heart dropped. "Discharged? When?"

"His family handled the paperwork this morning." The nurse yanked off the old sheets, voice flat. "Heard he was transferred abroad for treatment."

Susan froze. Her phone buzzed—a text from Nathan Foster: "Mr. Sullivan is gone. In the morgue."

Her fingers trembled uncontrollably. Darkness clouded her vision.

That bright, smiling young man would never call her "Susu" again.

She had promised to be his bride.

But yesterday, Andrew Lucas had taken her by force.

Had her betrayal killed him?

The phone rang abruptly. Torey Smith's voice was apologetic. "Ms. Thompson, the 'Enchanted Love' endorsement... Mr. Lucas pressured me. I had to replace you."

Susan bit her lip until blood filled her mouth.

"It's fine," she replied mechanically.

This was Ethan Sullivan's last wish for her. Now, even that was gone.

The icy wind cut deep, but she felt nothing. Until Nathan appeared at her apartment door, holding a sandalwood box.

"Ms. Thompson." His voice was hoarse. "Before he left... he wanted to stay with you."

Susan took the urn with shaking hands. Its weight nearly buckled her knees.

"He asked me to tell you..." Nathan's eyes were red. "Live well."

The turn of the lock was unnaturally loud. As Susan stepped inside, Nicole Capra's voice slithered through the air:

"Sister, aren't you going to invite me in to meet your new... roommate?"

She turned. Nicole strode past her in stilettos, uninvited.
###Chapter 115: Bloodstained Wedding Gown

Susan's fingers dug into the edges of the urn, her knuckles turning white. When Nicole walked in wearing high heels, Susan didn't even glance up.

"Sister, Ethan left so suddenly." Nicole's red lips curled into a sinister smile. "The doctors said he was out of danger."

Susan's head snapped up, fury blazing in her eyes. "It was you!"

"Yes, it was me." Nicole leaned in closer, her perfume mingling with the metallic scent of blood. "He shouldn't have protected you. My dear brother died so meaningfully."

When the urn crashed to the floor, Susan felt her heart shatter along with it. She dropped to her knees, hands trembling as she gathered the pale ashes.

"Oops, my hand slipped." Nicole's laughter was like a viper's hiss. "Don't worry, sister. I'll leave now."

The moment the door closed, Susan's tears finally hit the floor. She carefully collected every speck of ash, whispering, "Ethan, I promised to marry you..."

The diamond ring in the mall display case glittered coldly. As Susan swiped her card, the clerk asked, "Is the bride choosing the ring alone?"

"Yes." She traced the engraved initials "LYC" inside the band. "He's busy."

In the bridal boutique of Elysium, a crimson gown embroidered with golden phoenixes caught her eye. Just as her fingers brushed the sleeve, a familiar voice rang out.

"Andrew, let's pick this set for our wedding!" Nicole clung to Andrew's arm, freezing when she spotted Susan.

Vincent stepped in front of Candy with a frown. "Bad luck."

Susan walked straight to the most extravagant phoenix coronet and robe set. "Wrap it up." As she turned, her skirt swept past Nicole's feet, stirring a blood-tinged breeze.

"Susan!" Andrew suddenly grabbed her wrist. "Who are you marrying?"

The glass display reflected her pale smile. "Someone who will never betray me."

Outside the store, Susan touched the bottle of sulfuric acid in her bag. The cold wind blew her bangs aside, revealing eyes sharp with venom.
###Chapter 116: Obsessed and Mad for Her

Susan Thompson sneered inwardly. Today was truly unlucky.

She strode into the bridal boutique with her head held high. The crimson wedding gown shimmered under the lights.

The modernized traditional dress hung quietly in the corner, yet it seemed to pull at her gaze like a magnet.

The fiery red gown had clean, sharp lines. Golden embroidery bloomed at the waist. The semi-transparent cape featured a pair of mandarin ducks in flight, so lifelike they might take wing.

The price tag of 180,000 stung her eyes.

In the past, she would have walked away. But now, she wanted to indulge herself one last time before the end.

"Let me try this one," she said.

As she turned with the gown in her arms, she collided with three familiar faces.

"Getting married, sis?" Nicole Capra's saccharine voice made her stomach turn.

Susan ignored her, but Andrew Lucas seized her wrist.

"Who are you marrying?" His eyes churned with a terrifying storm.

"Ethan Sullivan." She met his gaze. "I promised I would."

The name pierced her heart like a blade. That sunny, warm young man was now nothing but ashes.

Andrew's fingers dug into her bones. The hanger in his grip twisted out of shape.

The fitting room door opened.

The red gown hugged her slender waist. The translucent cape fluttered lightly. Her pallid complexion glowed like peach blossoms against the crimson, her frail body adding a fragile beauty.

The staff held their breaths.

Vincent King's eyes darkened, his fingers tightening unconsciously.

"Vincent, I want this one too!" Candy Wilson tugged his arm, pouting. "I'll wear it when I marry you!"

Susan turned before the mirror, her lips curling in a mocking smile.

This wedding dress was fated to lie in the earth with her.
###Chapter 117: She Wants to Outshine Susan

Vincent King stood frozen in place.

Andrew Lucas caught Candy Wilson's call, his gaze inadvertently sweeping over Vincent's infatuated stare. His expression darkened instantly.

No one knew better than him how slender Susan Thompson's waist was.

And no one understood more deeply how intoxicating that delicate curve felt beneath his fingers.

The thought of Vincent fantasizing about those moments made Andrew's aura turn murderous.

If Vincent dared to look at Susan one more time, he would make him pay.

"Vincent, did you hear me?" Candy raised her voice. "I adore this wedding dress on Susan!"

"Can we buy it?"

Vincent finally snapped out of his trance, gently squeezing Candy's hand.

But when his eyes landed on Susan, they turned icy.

"Susan, take it off."

Susan froze, startled by his public demand.

She glanced down at the exquisite gown and let out a cold laugh.

"I'll take this one," she told the shop assistant. "Please wrap it up for me."

Before the assistant could respond, Vincent strode forward.

He loomed over her, his gaze slicing through the fabric like a blade.

"I said, take it off."

Candy immediately put on her sweetest act, clinging to Vincent's arm. "Vincent, it's fine. I love it, but I don't want to force Susan—"

"If you like it, no one gets to take it from you." Vincent tightened his grip on Candy's hand. "Susan, hand it over."

Susan scoffed.

Some things never changed.

As a child, Candy stole her toys. Now, she was stealing her clothes.

"Fine. It's mediocre anyway." Susan turned toward the fitting room. "Enjoy your shopping."

Candy's smile stiffened.

But she had no choice now. She forced herself to try on the dress.

When she stepped out, the staff exchanged awkward glances.

The manager recovered first, plastering on a smile. "Miss Wilson, you look stunning! Mr. King is so lucky!"

Candy's confidence surged.

She straightened her posture, only making her flat silhouette more obvious.

"Vincent, do I look beautiful?" she cooed.

"Hmm." His reply was absentminded.

Candy pressed on eagerly. "Who wears it better—me or Susan?"

Silence answered her.

Vincent's gaze had already followed Susan's retreating figure, disappearing around the stairwell.
###Chapter 118 The Price of Betrayal

Susan's fingers lingered on the wedding gown before slowly withdrawing. She recognized that greedy look in Candy's eyes—it was the same as a starving wolf eyeing its prey.

She turned toward another gown when a metallic taste flooded her throat. Susan bit her lip hard and staggered toward the restroom.

Blood splattered across the pristine white sink like blooming crimson flowers. A searing pain tore through her stomach as she curled into the corner, sweat drenching her back.

When she finally managed to stand, the mirror reflected a woman with a ghostly pale face.

Vincent's imposing figure blocked the hallway the moment she opened the door. The ice in his gaze made her shiver.

"Made your decision?" His voice was frigid.

Susan frowned. "You must be mistaken, Mr. King."

"One million." Vincent stepped closer. "Every month." His slender fingers lifted her chin. "Move to the Hillside Villa tonight."

Candy's scream pierced the air. "Vincent! How could you—"

Tears streamed down her face, smearing her carefully applied makeup. Andrew stood at the stairwell, his eyes burning with fury.

"Andrew..." Nicole's delicate hand grasped his arm. "Our engagement ring..."

Andrew shoved her away but froze when he saw Candy. His venomous glare sliced through Susan before he turned and left.

Nicole whispered meaningfully to Candy, "Don't give that vixen an opening."

Candy trembled violently before suddenly throwing herself into Vincent's arms. "I trust you... This must be a misunderstanding..."

Vincent pushed her away impassively. "You'll always be Mrs. King."

The words stabbed Candy like a knife. She clenched her skirt, nails digging into her palms.

"I refuse!" Her voice was hoarse. "You promised you'd only love me!"

Vincent's eyes turned cold. "Don't make a scene."

Candy's tears froze on her cheeks. Seeing Susan's bloodless lips, she suddenly smiled eerily.

"Fine." She said softly. "I'll wait for you at home."

As she turned away, a venomous glint flashed in her eyes. This game had only just begun.
###Chapter 119: His Cruelty Left Her No Escape

"Vincent, I'd like to speak with Susan alone."

Candy's voice was feather-light, yet it made Vincent King's brow furrow slightly. He glanced at his watch before nodding.

"Ten minutes."

Candy's fingers twisted the hem of her dress absently until Vincent disappeared around the staircase. She took a deep breath and turned to Susan Thompson.

Susan leaned against the wall, her forehead beaded with sweat from the sharp pain in her stomach. She just wanted to leave.

"Susan."

Candy suddenly grabbed her wrist with surprising force.

"Let go."

Susan tried to pull away, but the pain left her weak.

"Stop pretending to be innocent," Candy hissed, a flicker of madness in her eyes. "Vincent postponed our engagement party because of you. How dare you deny seducing him?"

Susan scoffed. "Get help."

"I hate that look on your face!" Candy abruptly released her and stepped back. "Who do you think you are? Just Andrew Lucas's discarded trash. You're not fit to compete with me."

Susan ignored her and turned to leave.

A scream pierced the air.

Susan whirled around just in time to see Candy tumbling down the stairs, her white dress blooming with bright red stains.

Vincent rushed forward as Susan instinctively reached out.

"Candy!"

He gathered the bloodied woman into his arms, his expression darkening dangerously.

"Vincent... our baby..." Candy weakly clutched his collar. "I wanted... to surprise you..."

Vincent froze. Two months ago, when he'd regained his memories, they had...

"She pushed me..." Candy's tears mixed with blood. "She said... she'd make me suffer..."

Susan stood rooted to the spot as murderous intent crystallized in Vincent's gaze.

"It wasn't me."

Her denial was drowned out by Candy's sobs.

Vincent lifted Candy and shot Susan one last look before leaving. That single glance plunged her into an icy abyss.

Roger Davis appeared behind her without warning, his grip like iron around her wrist.

"Miss Thompson, come with me."

The staff kept their heads down, pretending not to see anything.

As the car door slammed shut, Susan met Candy's triumphant gaze in the rearview mirror. Vincent's profile was as cold and sharp as a blade.
###Chapter 120: The Truth Behind Blood Debt

Vincent King held Candy Wilson tightly in his arms as the black car sped through the night. Roger Davis's hands trembled slightly on the steering wheel. Susan Thompson sat in the passenger seat, watching Vincent's bloodshot eyes in the rearview mirror.

She had never seen him like this before.

"Stop the car," Susan suddenly said. "I need to go back to Elysium to get the surveillance footage."

Roger's fingers tightened on the wheel as he glanced at Vincent through the mirror.

"Innocent?" Vincent's voice was icy. "I saw you push her with my own eyes."

Susan whipped her head around. "Candy fell on her own!"

"Susan!" Vincent slammed his fist against the seat. "If anything happens to Candy or the baby, I'll make you pay with your life!"

The hospital hallway was bathed in harsh white light.

Roger kept watch over Susan as her phone screen lit up. Bella Lucas replied quickly: "Don't worry, Susan. I'll retrieve the footage right away!"

"The camera was broken?" Susan stared at the latest message, her fingers turning cold.

The emergency room doors suddenly swung open.

"We couldn't save the baby," the doctor said, causing Vincent to stagger. "And... Miss Wilson will never be able to conceive again."

When Vincent turned, Susan saw murderous rage swirling in his eyes.

"Susan." He grabbed her throat. "How will you repay this?"

"It's Candy who owes a debt!" Susan gasped for air. "She's acting!"

Vincent's grip tightened. "Say that again?"

Susan's vision began to blur, but at the last moment, she spotted a familiar figure at the end of the hallway—Candy's assistant hastily putting away her phone.

The surveillance might be gone, but the truth would never stay buried.
###Chapter 121: He Wants to Destroy Susan's Child!

"Mr. King!" Nicole Capra rushed into the hospital room, her face deathly pale. "Candy... she's trying to kill herself with a fruit knife!"

Vincent King's pupils constricted violently. He shoved Susan Thompson aside and sprinted toward Candy Wilson's room.

Susan stared at Nicole's deceitful face, nausea churning in her stomach. This woman was like a persistent shadow, always appearing at the worst possible moments.

She tried to slip away, but Roger Davis blocked her path like an immovable wall. Bodyguards seized her without explanation, dragging her roughly toward Candy's room.

Candy lay on the hospital bed, her complexion ashen and eyes hollow. Blood trickled from her bitten lips.

The consequences of that reckless night had come too soon. She'd thought herself safe—no protection during her supposed infertile period—yet somehow gotten pregnant. What was meant to be a scheme against Susan had backfired, costing her the ability to ever bear children.

"Let me die..." Candy suddenly tore out her IV tube, staggering toward the window.

Vincent burst in and caught her, his voice trembling. "Candy, don't do this!"

"I'm ruined..." she wailed hysterically. "I can never give you children! Vincent, just let me go!"

He crushed her against his chest, knuckles whitening. "Don't say that. I need you alive. Always."

"But I—"

"We'll get married." His declaration brooked no argument. "Next month."

Candy froze, tears spilling as she looked up. "Really?"

"The only woman who will ever be Mrs. King is Candy Wilson." He gently wiped her cheeks. "And I'll make whoever hurt you pay."

After Candy fell asleep, Vincent stormed out with a face like thunder.

Susan was pinned against the wall by bodyguards, helpless. Vincent approached slowly, his dress shoes clicking like a death knell.

"You killed my child." He gripped her chin. "Your bastard may be dead, but its grave remains."

Nicole interjected smoothly, "Mr. King, I know where that bastard is buried."

Susan's blood turned to ice. "Don't you dare!"

Vincent shoved her aside and followed Nicole without a backward glance.

Susan fought desperately. By the time she broke free and reached the parking garage, only taillights remained. She flagged a taxi with shaking hands, nails digging bloody crescents into her palms.

At the cemetery, Vincent's men had already desecrated two graves. Daniel's bloodstained clothes and Bella Quinn's boots were trampled underfoot, coffin planks scattered like trash.

"Stop!" Susan threw herself over the tiny bloodied garment, unleashing a wounded animal's cry. Her tears splashed against the cold headstone.

She couldn't protect them in life. Now even their rest was violated. This all-consuming hatred would one day demand payment in blood.
###Chapter 122: The Last Obsession

Susan's fingers trembled violently as they brushed against the bloodstained fabric.

It was a torn fragment from Daniel's last piece of clothing.

"Stop!" She lunged at the man tearing apart the tombstone, her nails digging deep into his arm.

The man yelped in pain and backhanded her across the face.

Susan collapsed into the muddy ground, blood trickling from the corner of her mouth.

"Miss Thompson, don't waste your energy." Nicole stepped closer in her high heels, deliberately grinding Daniel's photo beneath her toe. "Keeping these things around is just bad luck."

Susan's gaze locked onto the shattered smile in the photo.

It was taken on Daniel's fifth birthday.

"Nicole, karma will get you." Her voice was hoarse, barely recognizable.

"Karma?" Nicole bent down, her blood-red nails gripping Susan's chin. "Look who's suffering right now?"

Vincent stood a short distance away, watching the scene unfold with cold indifference.

His pristine suit made him starkly out of place amidst the wreckage.

"Vincent," Nicole turned to him with tearful eyes, "Candy is still in the hospital. The doctors said... she might never..."

A shadow crossed Vincent's expression.

"Keep destroying it," he ordered, his voice icy. "Leave not a single brick standing."

Susan suddenly laughed.

The sound made everyone freeze.

"Vincent," she staggered to her feet, "do you remember that winter in the dungeon?"

He frowned.

"Daniel had a high fever. You wrapped your last coat around him." Her tears fell onto the dirt. "You promised to take him to Hokkaido to see the snow once we got out."

For a fleeting moment, something flickered in Vincent's eyes.

Then it vanished.

"Nonsense," he sneered. "Why would I know a woman like you?"

Susan didn't argue.

She simply clutched the button in her palm—the one Bella had pinned to her collar before leaving.

"Vincent!" Nicole gasped. "She's hiding something in her hand!"

Vincent strode forward and seized Susan's wrist.

"Let go."

She shook her head, her nails biting into her own flesh.

The bones in her hand creaked under the pressure.

"I said let go!" Vincent tightened his grip.

Blood seeped between Susan's fingers, dripping onto the remnants of the tombstone.

Still, she refused to release the button.

"Stubborn." Vincent abruptly released her and turned to his men. "Bring the gasoline."

Susan's pupils constricted.

"No..."

"Since you love this trash so much," Vincent took the canister, "let's make it disappear completely."

The sound of splashing liquid pierced her ears.

As the lighter clicked open, Susan threw herself forward.

Flames erupted, the scorching heat throwing her backward.

She watched as the fabric and button curled, blackened, and turned to ash in the fire.

"Happy now?" Vincent looked down at her. "This is the price for hurting Candy."

Susan didn't answer.

Her eyes remained fixed on the ashes. Then, suddenly, she reached out and grabbed a handful of the still-smoldering remnants.

The stench of burning flesh filled the air.

"Susan!" Vincent instinctively stepped forward before forcing himself to stop.

"It's fine." She pressed the ashes to her chest, her smile more painful than tears. "This way... they'll always be with me."

Nicole recoiled in disgust. "Madwoman!"

Vincent's expression grew complicated.

As he turned away, Susan whispered something so softly only the wind could carry it:

"Vincent, I'll wait for the day you regret this."

The ashes scattered into the distance like black snow.
###Chapter 123 Vincent, I Hate You to the Core!

Susan Thompson clutched the bloodstained fabric scrap with bone-white knuckles.

It was from Daniel's last outfit, still bearing traces of Bella Quinn's blood. Her only remaining memento. Her final solace in this world.

"Hand it over."

Vincent King's voice cut like ice, his once-tender eyes now glacial.

"Why?" Susan stepped back, her voice raw. "You've taken them from me. Won't you even leave me this?"

Vincent seized her wrist with bone-crushing force.

"Vincent!" Pain blurred Susan's vision. "Was destroying Bella's grave not enough? Candy's death had nothing to do with me!"

"Silence!"

He pried her fingers open. The bloodied fabric and wooden button clattered to the ground.

Susan lunged for them, but Vincent's shoe came down.

"No!" She shoved at him uselessly, like pushing against a mountain.

The splintering wood echoed the shattering of her heart.

Vincent's men swept the fragments into the fire. Flames devoured her last hope.

Susan collapsed, watching ashes scatter in the wind.

"Vincent," her voice feather-light, "I hate you."

The words struck him strangely. He gripped her throat, trying to choke off the unsettling declaration.

"I... hate you..." Susan gasped, her eyes terrifyingly empty.

Nicole Capra's gloating laughter pierced the air.

With sudden fury, Susan grabbed a broken plank and hurled it at Nicole.

"Susan!" Vincent slammed her to the ground.

Her answering smile unsettled him.

"Escort Miss Capra home," he ordered coldly, eyes locked on Susan.

Nicole shot Susan a triumphant look before leaving.

Vincent yanked Susan up roughly. "You owe me. Time to pay."

"I owe you nothing." Her whisper barely carried.

"You killed my child," Vincent snarled. "Now you'll give me and Candy another."

Susan closed her eyes as silent tears fell.
###Chapter 124: Susan Thompson, Ending This Miserable Life

Every inch of Susan's body ached.

Her skin and bones felt shattered, then clumsily reassembled. The excruciating pain blurred her mind, muffling Vincent's words.

She only remembered being thrown into a car. The Lamborghini's roar and violent jolts dragged her into darkness.

Suffocation yanked her back to consciousness.

Pressure around her throat triggered instinctive struggle. Her eyes opened to meet bloodshot ones.

"Vincent..."

Her voice barely escaped. The man once gentle as jade now radiated icy hatred.

"You owe me a life, Susan."

His grip tightened. She clawed at his fingers, but they were iron vices.

"Daniel's grave—" she choked out, her mind filled with images of her son's desecrated resting place.

"Silence!" Vincent released her throat only to slam her onto the bed. "Candy can never bear children because of you!"

Susan coughed violently, blood coating her tongue.

"I didn't push Candy—"

"I saw you shove her down the stairs!" His laugh was cruel. "Now you'll repay this debt with your womb."

Her pupils contracted. She understood—he'd force pregnancy, then kill her after childbirth.

"You're insane." Her voice shook. "I can't conceive."

Vincent stilled.

"The last miscarriage... The doctor said my uterus—" Blood spilled from her lips. "—is ruined."

Crimson stained the sheets. Vincent stared, his heart inexplicably twinging.

"Lies!" He seized her chin. "You think this act fools me?"

Susan shut her eyes in despair. She should've known—this man would never believe her again.

"Once you're pregnant," Vincent's voice dripped with venom, "you can die."

Warm liquid trailed her cheek. Not blood—tears.

"Vincent..." Her whisper faded. "Kill me now... Just end it..."

Better death than being reduced to a breeding vessel.

His kiss descended like punishment. Susan thrashed like a beached fish, drowning in pain.

"Death?" He hissed in her ear. "Too merciful."

Her fingers crept toward the nightstand. The shattering glass went unheard beneath rustling fabric.

She grasped the sharp fragment.

Better this than living in degradation...
###Chapter 125: Blood Redemption

The fruit knife on the nightstand gleamed coldly.

Susan Thompson's fingers trembled as they brushed against the icy handle.

She had considered pointing the blade at Vincent King's throat.

But four years of living together had carved itself into her bones. She couldn't do it.

If she couldn't hurt him, she would end herself instead.

As the sharp edge sliced her wrist, a strange relief washed over her.

This was better.

No more humiliation. No more pain.

"Daniel... Bella... Mommy's coming to see you now."

Vincent noticed the sudden stillness beneath him.

He smirked.

What new game was this woman playing?

Just as he moved to continue, the door burst open with a crash.

"Mr. King, I tried to stop Mr. Lucas—" The maid's panicked voice cut off.

Andrew Lucas's pupils constricted.

The blood staining the sheets stabbed at his vision.

"Susan!"

He threw Vincent aside with a roar, scooping up the barely breathing woman.

Vincent's fist flew at him with a whoosh. "Give her back!"

Andrew dodged, his eyes burning with fury. "Driving a woman to suicide? You're truly impressive, Vincent."

"Lies!" Vincent's face darkened. "She wanted—"

His words died.

Only then did he see the gruesome wound on Susan's wrist.

The bloodied knife lay mockingly by the bed.

Andrew slammed a flash drive against Vincent's face.

"See for yourself! You and Candy will pay a hundredfold for what you've done to her!"

As ambulance sirens wailed, Vincent stood frozen.

The video on the drive struck him like lightning.

The footage clearly showed Candy Wilson deliberately tumbling down the stairs.

Susan's outstretched hand had been trying to catch her.

"Mr. King?" The maid's timid voice snapped him back.

Vincent suddenly charged out like a madman.

Susan's faint words echoed in his mind:

"I'm going to die soon."

If she really died—

The thought turned his blood to ice.
###Chapter 126: Bloodstained Redemption

A sharp pain suddenly pierced Vincent King's chest.

He mechanically slid into the driver's seat. Only when his foot hit the accelerator did he realize with a start - he had no idea which hospital Andrew Lucas had taken Susan Thompson to.

Greenhill City had over a hundred hospitals. Searching blindly would be like finding a needle in a haystack.

His hands trembled as he dialed his assistant Roger Davis.

"Find out which hospital Susan's at immediately!"

After hanging up, Vincent sped aimlessly through the streets. Within ten minutes, Roger called back.

Susan had been taken to the same hospital as Candy Wilson. She was currently in emergency surgery.

Vincent jerked the steering wheel, running three red lights before screeching into the hospital parking lot in under twenty minutes.

Standing in the lobby, he suddenly realized he hadn't asked for the emergency room's exact location.

As he reached for his phone again, snippets of conversation drifted from a nearby hallway.

"That poor girl was covered in blood..."

"She was gone before the doctors could even start treatment."

"Young people these days take their lives so easily. Imagine her parents' grief."

"Her clothes were torn... probably assaulted..."

Vincent's ears rang. Only one detail registered - someone had died.

He grabbed the middle-aged man who'd spoken. "Who died? Where?"

The man stammered under Vincent's glare. "The... the girl who slit her wrists... probably in the morgue..."

Vincent's grip slackened.

He staggered back two steps, his chest feeling caved in by a sledgehammer.

In the morgue, a nervous doctor pointed to a gurney with a white sheet.

Vincent's hand hovered, unable to lift the covering.

When he finally saw the dead woman's face, he exhaled in relief - not Susan.

His phone vibrated. Roger's text gave the correct location: fifth floor emergency room.

Vincent took the stairs two at a time.

Outside the ER, Andrew Lucas paced restlessly. The normally composed third son of the Lucas family now had a loosened tie, wrinkled suit, and bloodshot eyes.

The ER doors swung open.

"She's lost too much blood and needs an immediate transfusion. But she's Rh-negative and we're low on stock."

"Take mine!" Andrew rolled up his sleeve without hesitation. "I'm Rh-negative too."

Watching Andrew follow the doctor inside, Vincent hated his own blood type for the first time.

His phone rang abruptly.

"Vincent! Candy's having another episode!" Nicole Capra's voice trembled. "She pulled out her IV and keeps screaming about stomach pain..."

Vincent glanced toward the inpatient wing at the end of the hall.

Candy's shrieks carried faintly: "Don't touch my baby! Help—"
###Chapter 127: The Agony of Truth

Vincent stood outside the hospital room door, his fingers hovering midair.

The memory of that rainy night four years ago flashed through his mind—Candy drenched, standing before him with starlight shimmering in her eyes.

He pushed the door open. The sharp scent of disinfectant assaulted his senses.

Candy leaned against the headboard, tear tracks staining her pale face. Her slender fingers clutched the blanket, knuckles turning white.

"Vincent!" Nicole rushed forward. "Candy just woke up from a nightmare. She's been crying nonstop."

His gaze settled on Candy's face.

Her lashes trembled as tears rolled down. He knew this look too well—the same fragile expression she wore whenever she felt wronged.

"Vincent..." Her voice shook. "I dreamed about our baby..."

His Adam's apple bobbed.

"He kept crying, asking why we abandoned him..." She covered her face, shoulders heaving violently. "It was Susan! She killed our child!"

The room fell into suffocating silence.

Vincent slowly walked to the window. Sunlight filtered through the blinds, casting fragmented shadows across his face.

"Candy." His voice was soft. "The security footage from Elysium has been restored."

Her sobs cut off abruptly.

Nicole's water glass slipped from her hand and shattered on the floor.

"Impossible!" Candy jerked her head up. "The cameras were—"

She bit her lip hard, cutting herself off.

Vincent turned. Ice filled his eyes. "Were what? Destroyed?"

All color drained from her face.

"I saw the video." He enunciated each word. "Susan never even touched you."

"You're lying!" she shrieked. "She pushed me!"

She threw off the blankets, only to trip over the IV line and crash onto the floor. The needle tore from her hand, blood welling instantly.

"Candy!" Nicole scrambled to help.

Vincent didn't move.

Candy lifted her face to him from the ground. Tears mixed with blood, streaking down her cheeks.

"Why..." Her voice was raw. "Why do you always believe her over me?"

He bent to pick up the fallen medical chart.

"Uterine perforation. Permanent infertility." He read the diagnosis quietly. "Was framing Susan worth it?"

Her pupils contracted violently.

"I didn't!" she screamed hysterically. "Susan did this to me!"

Vincent tossed his phone onto the bed.

The screen played a video: Candy standing at the top of a staircase, glancing around before deliberately throwing herself down.

Her breathing turned ragged.

"Fake... That's fake footage..." She shook her head wildly. "Susan doctored it!"

His expression frosted over completely.

"Candy Wilson." For the first time, he used her full name. "We're done."

She went eerily still.

Slowly, she sat upright and wiped her face clean. When she looked up again, all traces of vulnerability had vanished.

"Vincent King." She smiled coldly. "You think this is over?"

Outside the window, dark clouds swallowed the sun.
###Chapter 128: Vincent's Devotion Wasted

Candy's tears fell like broken pearls. She clutched Vincent's sleeve with trembling fingers, her voice shaking uncontrollably.

"Vincent...are you abandoning me?"

Her nails dug into her palms, yet she felt no pain.

"I deserve this! It's all my fault! Now I can't even be a mother anymore. How could I face you?"

Vincent frowned deeply.

The weeping woman before him overlapped with the girl who had stayed by his side during his darkest days.

"Candy..."

"Don't!" She cut him off sharply. "I know you think I'm vile! But I just couldn't help it..."

She suddenly threw herself into his arms, sobbing violently.

"Seeing you with Susan...it felt like a knife twisting here!" She pounded her chest desperately.

Vincent's hand froze midair.

Four years ago on that rainy night, Candy had pulled him from the mud. Now she lay broken in his arms—he couldn't remain indifferent.

"Let's get married."

Candy's crying stopped abruptly.

Her eyes widened in disbelief.

"Vincent, you..."

"We'll register tomorrow." His voice was calm, but his gaze drifted to the window where a leaf spiraled downward.

Candy buried her face against his chest, a triumphant smile curling her lips. Nicole had been right—mentioning those four years always softened him.

But she missed the ice in Vincent's eyes.

Meanwhile, in the hospital room...

Susan's lashes fluttered.

She dreamed of walking along the River Styx, where Grandma Thompson held little Daniel's hand waiting for her.

"Mommy!" Daniel ran toward her.

She knelt and hugged the child she'd longed for.

"Susan." Ethan Sullivan smiled at her from nearby. "I've come for you."

They held a simple wedding—no guests, no flowers, only blessings from loved ones.

"Ethan..." she murmured, fingers tightening unconsciously.

"Susan!"

A furious shout yanked her back to reality.

Andrew Lucas loomed over her, stormy eyes blazing with rage.

"Look at me! I'm Andrew Lucas!"

She blinked dazedly as dream and reality blurred then separated.

She wasn't dead.

The realization tightened her chest.

"Let go," she said coldly.

Andrew only gripped her wrist harder, veins bulging.

"I gave 1200cc of my Rh-negative blood to save you!" He ground out each word. "And your first words are another man's name?"

Susan suddenly laughed.

The sound made Andrew's eyes sting.

"Mr. Lucas, did I ask to be saved?"

She yanked her hand back, revealing needle bruises.

"I'd rather have died in that basement than be saved by you."

Andrew stood so abruptly his chair screeched across the floor.

He seized her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze.

"Say that again."

She stared straight into his eyes. "I. Would. Rather. Die."

His pupils contracted violently.

Releasing her, he suddenly punched the wall.

Blood streaked down the white surface.

"Fine. Perfect." His back trembled slightly. "You're ruthless, Susan."

The door slammed shut behind him.

Susan stared at the ceiling as silent tears fell.
###Chapter 129: Susan, You're Mine!

"Andrew Lucas, let me go!" Susan struggled violently, her slender wrists fragile in the man's grip.

She knew her time was running out. She had to fulfill her final wish soon. Daniel and Bella Quinn's coffins were still exposed in the wilderness, and Ethan Sullivan's ashes lay alone in Willow Lane.

"Going to find Ethan?" Andrew sneered, tightening his hold. "Don't even think about it!"

Susan tumbled off the hospital bed, her knees hitting the floor hard. She gritted her teeth and tried to push herself up, but he yanked her back.

"Get off me!" she screamed hysterically, her nails leaving bloody scratches on his arm.

Andrew threw her onto the bed and pinned her down. His kiss was punishing, rough against her lips.

"You're mine!" he growled, his fingers digging into her shoulders.

Susan suddenly stopped resisting. Her eyes were empty as she stared at the ceiling. "Touch me again, and I'll slit my wrists again." Her voice was feather-light, but it froze Andrew in place.

"You wouldn't dare!" He grabbed her chin in fury.

Susan gave him a bleak smile. "Try me."

His pupils contracted violently. The memory of her pale face in the ER, the ghastly wound on her wrist, flashed through his mind. Rage and fear tore at his chest, finally erupting in a low snarl. "You're not allowed to love him!"

"That's not your call." She shoved him away and stumbled toward the door.

The icy wind howled through the corridor, snowflakes swirling inside. Her thin hospital gown flapped wildly, but she felt no cold.

"Stop!" Andrew caught up and roughly wrapped his coat around her. His voice dropped suddenly. "Forget him... Let's start over."

Susan walked into the blizzard without looking back.

In the cemetery, the shattered coffin was buried under snow. Susan knelt in the frozen mud, digging with her bare hands. Her nails broke, blood mixing with dirt, but she seemed numb to the pain.

"Daniel... Mommy's here..." she whispered, piecing the coffin fragments back together.

Snowflakes melted on her trembling lashes, falling like tears. Behind her, a shadow crept closer...
###Chapter 130: Susan, Why Are You Dying?!

"I'm sorry, little ones."

Susan's throat tightened as she gazed at the familiar names carved into the tombstone.

She slowly knelt down, fingertips tracing the cold stone surface as if she could touch her lost loved ones through it.

"Mommy misses you so much..."

Her unfinished words dissolved into tears that fell onto the damp earth.

Taking a deep breath, she fought to suppress the overwhelming emotions.

The wind had scattered some soil from the grave. She carefully gathered it back, handful by handful.

Her movements were slow, deliberate - like performing a sacred ritual.

"Wait for me..."

Susan murmured to herself, thinking she should bring a piece of clothing to bury here.

At least this way she'd have a resting place.

She had signed the organ donation agreement. After death, not even ashes would remain.

But she feared. Feared that without a grave, she might lose her way in the afterlife.

Feared she wouldn't find those she longed to see most.

As she stood up, she collided with a pair of dark, intense eyes.

Vincent stood silently behind her, his presence sudden and unexpected.

Susan froze, instinctively stepping back.

Dark memories flooded her mind like an incoming tide.

"Susan."

His voice made her fingers tremble.

She feared he'd demand compensation for that nonexistent child again.

"Vincent, let me go."

Her voice was soft but resolute.

"I've already died once. We're even now."

Vincent's brow furrowed.

This wasn't the first time she'd mentioned death.

"What's wrong with you?"

He stepped forward; she immediately retreated.

"I'm dying."

A bitter smile touched her pale lips.

"I can't have any more children."

Vincent's heart lurched.

"Explain yourself!"

He grabbed her wrist.

"Agh—"

Susan gasped in pain.

Only then did Vincent notice the bandages wrapping her wrist.

He released her as if burned.

"I'm sorry..."

The words startled even himself.

Susan stared in shock.

"It's been cleared up."

Vincent's voice was low.

"You didn't push Candy down the stairs."

Susan exhaled deeply.

At least this was something.

No more forced pregnancies.

She turned to leave but his voice stopped her.

"What did you mean by 'dying'?"

Even Vincent didn't recognize the urgency in his own voice.

"None of your concern."

Susan didn't look back.

Vincent suddenly grew agitated.

He blocked her path, voice turning harsh.

"Explain yourself!"

Susan retreated under his pressure.

Her wounds throbbed dully.

"If you truly want to make amends..."

She glanced at Daniel's grave.

"Sing 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' for him."

Vincent's expression darkened.

"Impossible!"

He never sang. Certainly not for that child.

Susan had expected this answer.

Her lips twisted slightly.

"Then forget it."

Tears welled but didn't fall.

"When I'm gone..."

"Visit Daniel sometimes."

Her words were barely audible, like a sigh.

"Susan!"

Vincent seized her shoulders.

"What are you hiding? Why are you dying?"

His voice held an unfamiliar panic.

Susan met his gaze with terrifying calm.

"Vincent, we ended long ago."

She gently removed his hands.

Her legs nearly gave way as she turned.

Late-stage cancer made every step agony.

Vincent stood rooted, watching her unsteady retreat.

Something clenched painfully in his chest.

He suddenly remembered the girl who used to chase after him, sweetly calling him "Vincent."

Now only this fragile shell remained.

"Susan!"

He called again.

This time, she didn't turn back.
###Chapter 131: Susan, You Shatter My Heart

Susan turned to leave. Vincent's tall figure blocked the path ahead. Without hesitation, she veered onto a side trail.

Her back was straight, yet an indescribable loneliness clung to her.

Vincent's chest tightened.

A nameless dread seized him—if he let her walk away today, he might never see her again.

"Susan!" The words burst from his lips. "I'll sing! I'll sing 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' for that child!"

The moment he spoke, he froze.

A bitter laugh escaped him.

Since when had Vincent King, heir to the King fortune, compromised like this for a woman?

Candy had begged him countless times to sing, but he'd always refused, claiming he didn't know how.

"What did you say?" Susan whirled around, her voice trembling.

"I said I'll sing." Vincent pulled out his phone to search for the lyrics, clearing his throat awkwardly.

"Twinkle twinkle little star,
How I wonder what you are..."

That voice—so achingly familiar.

Susan's eyes welled instantly.

Memories crashed over her like tidal waves.

In the dungeon, Vincent had cradled a feverish Daniel, singing this song on repeat.

Daniel had loved his voice more than anything.

That time Daniel fell badly, scraping his knees and forehead, crying until he could barely breathe—

Vincent had gathered him close, humming softly as if soothing an infant.

Gradually, Daniel's sobs had softened into even breaths.

Susan walked to the gravestone, wiping her eyes.

Daniel, can you hear?

Uncle Murphy is singing for you.

He fulfilled your last wish. Can you forgive him now?

He just... forgot us.

Vincent's voice abruptly cut off.

He'd never sung this before, yet every note felt unnervingly familiar.

Flashes of hazy images—

A limping man holding something, singing the same melody over and over.

His head throbbed violently.

Gritting his teeth, he forced out the final note, his back drenched in sweat.

"Thank you." Susan smiled, tears glistening. "Daniel must be so happy—"

Blood sprayed from her lips before she could finish.

Crimson streaked down her pale fingers, horrifyingly vivid.

Susan turned hastily, but more blood gushed forth.

"Susan!"

Vincent caught her, trembling fingers brushing her bloodied mouth.

Each wipe revealed fresh red.

An invisible fist clenched around his heart.

Not even Candy's bloodied collapse had terrified him like this.

"To the hospital!"

"No... Home... I need Ethan..."

Even now, she thought of another man!

Vincent shoved her into the car, flooring the accelerator.

"Stop!" Susan suddenly grabbed the door handle.

"Are you insane?" He swerved, pinning her down.

Blood soaked the seats—and stained his vision red.
###Chapter 132: Destroying Nicole's Face!

"Susan!"

Vincent King nearly shattered his molars from clenching his jaw, yet still slammed on the brakes.

This marked the first time in his life he'd yielded to a woman.

The car door had barely cracked open when Susan stumbled out. Her legs gave way, knees buckling as she nearly collapsed, only managing to stay upright by clutching the doorframe.

Vincent followed swiftly, seizing her slender wrist.

"Let go!"

Susan recoiled like a startled rabbit, but the man's iron grip held firm.

His expression darkened, fury roiling in his chest, yet his voice softened. "I'll take you home."

Susan's head snapped up, her damp eyes wide with disbelief.

She offered no further protest, silently withdrawing her hand before sliding back into the car.

The Lamborghini glided through bustling streets. Through the rearview mirror, Vincent watched the pale woman in the backseat, unconsciously easing off the accelerator.

Willow Lane arrived.

When Vincent moved to escort her upstairs, Susan's wary gaze barred him at the threshold. He narrowed his eyes—no matter. His prey would be his eventually.

The key's turn screeched unnaturally loud.

Upon opening the door, Susan froze as if struck by lightning—

Ethan Sullivan's urn lay in shattered ruins!

Sandalwood fragments littered the floor, ashes defiled by fresh spit. Susan trembled violently, nails biting into her palms.

On the table, a saliva-drenched note glared up:

"Dear sister, do you like my gift? Watching you suffer keeps me awake with joy."

The handwriting twisted like venomous serpents.

Susan crushed the paper and hurled it against the wall, hatred surging like a tidal wave in her chest. Gently cradling the ashes, her tears fell onto the grayish powder.

"Nicole..."

From the drawer, she retrieved the prepared sulfuric acid bottle. The knife's edge glinted coldly under the light.

The upscale villa's security recognized this "Capra heiress" and waved her through.

Before ornate European gates, Susan stood with the warming acid bottle. She only needed to wait—for the viper to slither into her trap.

Within half an hour, Nicole approached in clicking stilettos.

"Sister?" Her feigned surprise arched an eyebrow.

Susan wasted no words.

The acid bottle traced a perfect arc through the air, thick liquid flying toward that exquisite face—

"Aaaah!!"

A bloodcurdling scream pierced the night.
###Chapter 133: Susan's Blade of Vengeance

"Are you insane, sister?!"

"Andrew, save me!"

The pungent stench of sulfuric acid exploded in the air. Nicole Capra's pupils constricted in terror.

Her meticulously planned scheme had failed to kill Ethan Sullivan, but she'd faked his gruesome death to shatter Susan Thompson's last shred of sanity.

Yet she never imagined Susan would come seeking revenge with sulfuric acid.

Nicole desperately shielded her face, her legs buckling. At the critical moment, a figure yanked her into a protective embrace.

"Hiss—"

Concentrated acid splashed across Andrew Lucas's back.

"Andrew!" Nicole trembled as she inspected his injuries.

The thick winter coat dissolved into grotesque holes, revealing charred, bubbling flesh beneath. The acid still sizzled, emitting acrid white smoke.

Tears streamed down Nicole's face.

She shuddered at the thought—had that acid struck her face instead...

"I'm fine." Andrew subtly shifted away from her touch. "Are you hurt?"

"You fool!" Nicole sobbed dramatically. "How can you worry about me in this state?"

Susan's hand trembled around the empty bottle.

She hadn't expected Andrew to shield Nicole.

Her heart felt cleaved by a blunt knife, but she forced herself to look away.

No matter. She had another weapon.

The fruit knife hidden in her purse gleamed coldly.

"Susan!" Andrew's roar cracked like thunder. "How dare you attack Nicole like this!"

"Yes, I want her to suffer!" Susan's laugh was chilling, her eyes burning with madness.

Nicole instantly switched to damsel-in-distress mode, stepping forward with tearful eyes. "Sister, what did I do wrong? A woman's face is her most precious asset!"

"Precious?" Susan's voice was hoarse. "More precious than lives?"

She suddenly seized Nicole's collar and slammed her against the wall.

"You killed Daniel. You killed Grandma. You killed Bella..." Blood-tinged tears streaked Susan's face. "And now you won't even spare their ashes!"

"You've lost your mind, Susan!" Andrew snapped. "Nicole had nothing to do with those tragedies!"

"Nothing to do with it?" Susan's hysterical laughter sent chills down their spines.

In a flash, she drew the fruit knife, its blade aiming straight for Nicole's heart.

Nicole subtly adjusted her angle—

"Thud!"

The sharp blade sank into her left shoulder, instantly staining her white blouse crimson.

"This stab is for Daniel!"

Susan's voice carried a curse straight from hell.
###Chapter 134: Blood for Blood

"Ah—"

Nicole Capra's scream pierced the air as she staggered back, clutching her shoulder, her face twisted in terror. "Andrew! She's gone mad! She's trying to kill me!"

Susan Thompson's hand trembled around the kitchen knife. She knew she'd fallen into Nicole's trap again, but she had no choice left.

"Nicole Capra, die!"

The blade flashed forward—only to be caught mid-air by a strong, bony hand.

"Susan, that's enough!" Andrew Lucas's voice was icy.

Susan looked up into eyes that had once been tender. Now, they held nothing but disgust and fury.

"Andrew, move!" Her voice was hoarse. "She killed Daniel! She killed Bella Quinn! She killed Ethan Sullivan!"

Nicole hid behind Andrew, the ghost of a smirk playing on her lips. "Sister, please calm down..."

"Shut up!" Susan's entire body shook. "Were you calm when you spat on Ethan's ashes?"

Andrew's brow furrowed. "Susan, you're insane."

"Yes, I am!" Susan laughed wildly. "I lost my mind the day you murdered Daniel!"

She wrenched her hand free and lunged at Nicole again. The knife gleamed coldly under the lights.

"Thud—"

Andrew sidestepped, sending Susan crashing to the floor. The knife skittered away with a sharp clatter.

"Andrew..." Nicole whimpered weakly in his arms. "It hurts..."

Blood bloomed across her white down jacket like a poppy in full bloom.

Andrew scooped Nicole up, pausing only to cast Susan one final glance. "You belong in a mental institution."

Susan lay on the ground, staring at her trembling hands. The bandage on her left wrist was soaked with blood, her right wrist swollen and purple.

"Nicole Capra..." she whispered. "You'll die a wretched death..."

Over Andrew's shoulder, Nicole flashed a triumphant smile, mouthing silently: "You lose."

Sirens wailed in the distance. Susan gazed at the ceiling, suddenly remembering that rainy night four years ago.

Back then, Andrew would hold an umbrella for her. He'd call her "Susie."

Now, he carried her enemy away without a backward glance.

With great effort, Susan pushed herself up and retrieved the bloodstained knife.

"This isn't over..." She wiped blood from her lips. "Blood debts must be paid in blood."

Outside, snow began to fall—just as cold as that night four years ago.
###Chapter 135 Prisoner of the Madhouse

Andrew's fingertips trembled slightly.

He looked down at Nicole's deathly pale face in his arms, then at Susan swaying unsteadily in the distance. His chest ached as if pierced repeatedly by a sharp blade.

"Susan, kneel and apologize to Nicole!"

"Apologize?" Susan suddenly laughed, the sound colder than winter's bitter wind. "Andrew, you want me to apologize to the murderer who slaughtered my entire family?"

Nicole whimpered weakly, burrowing deeper into Andrew's embrace. Blood from her shoulder bloomed across the snow like crimson plum blossoms.

"Daniel... Grandma... and Ethan Sullivan..." Susan's pupils dilated, her gaze growing vacant. "They all died by Nicole's hand. Now not even their ashes remain—"

"Enough!" Andrew snapped sharply, cutting her off. "Ethan is clearly at the laboratory—"

His words died abruptly.

The look in Susan's eyes chilled him to the bone. Those once-starry eyes now gaped like bottomless voids.

"Andrew..." Nicole moaned in pain. "I'm so cold..."

Andrew jolted back to reality, pulling out his phone to call Leo. "Dispose of her." He scooped Nicole into his arms and strode away without a backward glance.

Susan watched their retreating figures until suddenly, blood gushed from her lips.

The scarlet droplets splattered across the snow, mirroring the red roses Andrew had gifted her on that Valentine's Day long ago.

When Leo arrived, Susan already lay unconscious in a pool of blood. Frantic, he called Andrew. "Mr. Lucas, Miss Thompson has vomited blood and lost consciousness. Should I send her to the hospital—"

"Admit her to Greenhill Mental Hospital." The roar of jet engines nearly drowned out Andrew's voice. "Book two tickets to Paris."

Three days later, Susan awoke to a bone-chilling cold.

The stench of mildew mixed with disinfectant assaulted her nostrils. She tried to sit up but found her limbs strapped tightly to the metal bed with leather restraints.

"Awake?"

That familiar voice sent tremors through Susan's body. Nicole sauntered in on ten-centimeter heels, her red dress blazing like fire.

"Welcome to Greenhill." Nicole leaned down, dragging crimson nails across Susan's pallid cheek. "Know what this place is? Hell on earth."

Susan's pupils contracted violently.

"Patients go mad here every day." Nicole's voice dripped honey. "Last week, a nurse had her fingers bitten clean off..." She lowered her voice to a whisper. "Andrew personally signed your admission papers."

A bloodcurdling scream echoed down the hallway, followed by the scraping of heavy chains. Susan's breathing grew ragged, her chest heaving.

"Don't be scared." Nicole tenderly tucked in the blanket corners. "This is only the beginning."

She turned toward the door, then glanced back with a dazzling smile. "Oh, I almost forgot. Tomorrow, Andrew and I are holding our engagement press conference."

As the door clicked shut, howls rose and fell in the darkness. Countless pairs of eyes watched from the shadows outside Susan's room.
###Chapter 136: The Truth Shatters! Catherine Capra Is Your Real Mother!

Susan Thompson stared coldly at Nicole Capra's hypocritical face, her every breath laced with revulsion.

Nicole only smiled brighter, fingertips tracing her flawless makeup.

"Did you know, sister?" She suddenly leaned close, her sickly sweet voice whispering in Susan's ear. "Andrew Lucas told me last night while holding me that your face makes him sick."

Susan's nails dug deep into her palms.

"But..." Nicole produced a silver syringe from her bag, its surface glinting coldly under the light. "He cares more about my suffering."

The liquid inside glowed an eerie blue.

"Know what this is?" Nicole shook the syringe. "It'll make your nerves rot bit by bit until..." She mimed a limp collapse. "You'll lie there like sludge waiting to die."

Susan's pupils contracted violently.

"Scared?" Nicole yanked the blanket away and plunged the needle into Susan's thigh. "This is just the beginning!"

Pain crashed over Susan like a tidal wave. She bit through her lower lip.

"Oh..." Nicole's expression twisted with sudden recollection. "There's something you should know."

She bent down until her crimson lips nearly touched Susan's ear:

"Catherine Capra was never my mother."

Susan's entire body went rigid.

"That baby girl stolen from the Thompson family twenty years ago..." Nicole's nails scraped Susan's pale cheek. "Was you, my dear sister."

The words detonated in Susan's mind like a bomb.

"No..."

"Why not?" Nicole laughed wildly. "Why do you think those thugs took your hair? To run a DNA test under my name!"

Susan's vision filled with Catherine's gentle smile.

"That's why I had to kill her." Nicole's eyes gleamed with venom. "She shouldn't have eavesdropped on our secret."

"You monster!" Susan thrashed violently, only to be crushed by fresh agony.

Nicole watched her suffering with relish, leisurely adjusting her sleeves.

"Don't worry. You'll reunite with your mother underground soon enough." She turned toward the door, then glanced back with a radiant smile. "Oh, the drug takes three hours to fully activate. Plenty of time for you to... savor every moment."

The door slammed shut.

Susan stared at the ceiling as tears finally broke free.

So she hadn't been abandoned by the entire world.

Someone had loved her all along.

But was it too late to matter now?
###Chapter 137: The Bloodline Truth

The clicking of high heels gradually faded as Nicole Capra's figure disappeared through the hospital room door.

Susan Thompson's fingers clutched the bedsheet so tightly her knuckles turned white.

She was actually Catherine Capra and Victor Thompson's daughter.

Memories flooded back. That inexplicable sense of familiarity when she first saw Catherine on TV as a child. The warmth that surged in her heart every time she saw Ethan Sullivan. The Thompson parents' obvious favoritism toward Nicole...

Now everything made sense.

Her phone screen lit up, displaying a slideshow of Catherine's photos. Susan traced the images with trembling fingers, her vision blurred by tears.

"Mom..."

The woman in the photos had delicate features and an elegant demeanor. But Susan knew how tenderhearted she truly was. Nicole had bragged countless times about having the best mother in the world.

An invisible hand seemed to squeeze her heart.

She suddenly remembered Ethan's words. In those brief moments when Catherine regained consciousness after her injury, her first words were telling Victor not to hurt her.

"Mom..." Susan pressed the phone against her chest. "I love you too..."

The hospital room was eerily silent.

She had to tell Victor the truth. But who would believe her? He only had eyes for that impostor Nicole now.

If only Ethan were still here...

Susan abruptly grabbed her phone and dialed Nathan Foster's number.

No answer.

After a dozen attempts, she dropped the phone in defeat.

The ringtone suddenly blared. "Andrew Lucas" flashed across the screen.

"Made up your mind?" The man's icy voice came through.

Susan froze. "About what?"

"Apologizing to Nicole." Andrew's tone simmered with restrained anger.

"Never." Her voice was soft but firm.

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"Andy." The childhood nickname slipped out, startling them both.

"Help me." She took a deep breath. "Tell the Thompsons Nicole isn't their daughter. She's an impostor—"

"Susan!" Andrew's voice sharpened. "The DNA test proved it! Are you seriously claiming you're their daughter now?"

She gripped the phone tighter, silent.

"You're beyond redemption!" The call ended with a violent click.

The phone slid from her limp hand as Susan stared blankly out the window.

Suddenly, the door burst open.

Several distorted figures staggered in, wearing grotesque smiles.
###Chapter 138: Farewell, Susan

The acrid smell of disinfectant mixed with the metallic tang of blood hung heavy in the air.

Susan curled into the corner of her hospital bed, watching the figures in blue-and-white striped gowns advance. Their eyes gleamed with animalistic hunger, lips twisted into grotesque smiles.

"That's her!" A skeletal woman shrieked, pointing at Susan. "She stole the boss's face!"

The crowd parted to reveal a middle-aged woman with scarred cheeks. Slowly, she raised a hand to touch her disfigured skin.

"My face..." she murmured before lunging at Susan with sudden fury. "Give it back!"

Susan instinctively shielded her face. She knew death approached, but she'd cling to this last shred of dignity.

Dozens of hands tore at her hair and clothes. Nails raked her skin, sending tremors through her body. Fabric ripped. Cold tiles pressed against her lacerated back.

"Freak!"
"Four-fingered monster!"
"Beat her to death!"

The insults came in waves. Susan's vision blurred as blood trickled from her lips. A rusted knife flashed before her eyes—

"Stop!"

The roar cracked like thunder.

Through the haze, Susan saw a familiar figure burst through the door. Moving like lightning, he subdued her attackers within seconds.

"Susan..."

Warm hands cradled her face. She struggled to open her eyes, meeting a gaze brimming with anguish.

"Ethan...?"

"It's me." Ethan Sullivan wrapped his coat around her battered body. "I'm getting you out of here."

She shook her head weakly, clutching his sleeve. "Home... I want to go home..."

She longed to tell him the truth—to call him "little brother" just once. But darkness swallowed her too fast. All she managed was to nuzzle against his chest like she'd done with their mother as a child.

Three days later.

Ethan stood by the hospital window, watching Susan's still form. The doctors said her organs were failing. She might not survive the winter.

His phone vibrated—a text from his father reminding him of today's engagement banquet.

"Sir, it's time," the butler murmured at the door.

Ethan pressed a kiss to Susan's forehead. "Wait for me."

He'd never know this was their final goodbye.

When he rushed back, the room stood empty. Nurses said Susan had awakened at noon, insisting on leaving. No one knew where she'd gone—just as no one knew which world had finally claimed her.

Outside, the first snow of winter began to fall. Pristine flakes erased all traces, as if a girl named Susan had never existed at all.
###Chapter 139 Farewell, Andrew

Susan Thompson opened her eyes shortly after Ethan Sullivan left.

Firecrackers crackled intermittently outside the window.

Though Greenhill City had banned fireworks, today felt unusually lively.

The noise meant nothing to Susan. She only wanted to know if she was alive or dead.

The stabbing pain in her stomach and the agony in her legs confirmed she still breathed.

But what about Ethan?

She glanced around the Willow Lane apartment. That day at Greenhill Mental Hospital hadn't been a hallucination - Ethan had truly returned.

Then why had Nathan Foster lied to her?

Her thoughts moved sluggishly now, each one triggering splitting headaches.

No matter. Ethan was alive. That's all that mattered.

She had to tell him the truth - that she was his biological sister. And warn him about Nathan.

Susan reached for her phone when several notifications flashed across the screen.

Andrew Lucas and Nicole Capra were engaged.

Her fingers nearly lost their grip.

Though she'd expected this, the pain still pierced her heart like a blade. She pressed a hand to her chest, but the ache remained.

As she dialed Ethan's number, thick smoke suddenly filled her nostrils.

Susan coughed violently.

The smoke grew denser, as if the entire apartment were burning.

She had to escape.

Her legs refused to move, forcing her to drag herself off the bed using only her arms. After several attempts, she collapsed onto the floor.

Black smoke now curled beneath the bedroom door.

She crawled toward the exit, only to find it locked from the outside.

Dark plumes began rising from the balcony.

The fire spread rapidly. Soon this room would become an inferno.

Susan dragged herself back toward the bed, fumbling for her fallen phone.

Her trembling fingers accidentally tapped the first contact - Andrew.

The call connected.

"Susan?" Andrew's voice was glacial.

"Andrew, I'm going to die."

A cold laugh answered her. "Today's my engagement to Nicole. What game are you playing now?"

"I'm not trying to ruin anything," Susan whispered, her voice fading. "I just wanted to say goodbye."

"Good riddance." His tone dripped with scorn. "May you find better luck in your next life."

Tears blurred her vision.

"Thank you for your blessing, Mr. Lucas." With her last strength, she ended the call.

She tried dialing Ethan, but no one answered.

As she began typing a text to reveal the truth, a burning ceiling panel crashed down.

Sparks flew. The phone shattered.

In the balcony's fiery glow, Susan's consciousness dimmed.

One final thought flickered: So this was her fate - to perish in flames.
###Chapter 140: Farewell in Flames

The crystal chandeliers in Seaview's most luxurious hotel cast dazzling reflections across the ballroom. The union of the Lucas and Thompson families had drawn every elite in the city.

Nicole Capra stood radiant in a crimson cheongsam, its golden phoenix embroidery shimmering under the lights. She clung to Andrew Lucas's arm, her smile as bright as spring sunshine.

Yet the man beside her wore a grim expression, as though attending a funeral.

Ethan Sullivan observed the farce from a shadowed corner. He lifted a champagne flute to his lips, then grimaced—the drink tasted sickeningly sour.

"Congratulations, Ethan." A guest approached with empty pleasantries.

Ethan's lips twisted as he slammed the glass onto a passing waiter's tray. "For what? Celebrating my sister marrying a blind fool?"

Before he could finish, Victor Thompson yanked him backward by the collar and dragged him into a private lounge.

"Dad! Easy!" Rubbing his sore neck, Ethan pulled out his silenced phone. Six missed calls—all from Susan Thompson.

His return call connected only to a robotic voicemail prompt.

His heart stuttered.

Outside, excited chatter filled the hallway.

"There's a fire on Willow Lane! They say a woman's trapped on the sixth floor—"

Ethan's blood turned to ice. He burst through the door and collided with Andrew in the corridor.

"Car keys!" His voice shook. "Susan might be in trouble!"

Andrew's pupils contracted. He recalled that strange call thirty minutes ago—Susan's whispered "I'm going to die."

Fragments of conversation drifted from a nearby executive group:

"...burned beyond recognition..."

"...door was bolted from the inside. No escape..."

Andrew's fingers trembled. He seized the speaker's lapels. "Exact location!"

"S-sixth floor..."

The world shattered.

Ethan was already sprinting toward the elevators, but Andrew stood paralyzed, his legs leaden. Mechanically, he redialed that familiar number again and again.

"The subscriber you are calling is currently unavailable..."

Laughter and celebration music from the engagement party clashed grotesquely with the pounding of his heart.

The chandelier flickered suddenly, its glare stinging his eyes.

"Andrew!" Ethan's roar echoed from the elevator. "Move your goddamn ass!"

Andrew jolted awake. He stumbled forward, his suit jacket knocking over a hallway vase.

The shattering porcelain sounded exactly like his heart breaking.
###Chapter 141: The Agony of Loss

"Sixth floor..."

Ethan Sullivan's pupils constricted violently. His phone slipped from his fingers.

He sprinted toward the elevator like a madman, only to find it under maintenance.

Without hesitation, he turned and bolted for the emergency stairs.

Apartment 6 in Building 8—that familiar door number he knew by heart.

Andrew Lucas violently shook off William Ferber's grip.

He didn't even grab his suit jacket before chasing after Ethan.

In the hotel lobby, Nicole Capra approached in a pristine white gown, holding a bouquet.

"Andrew, all the guests have arrived," she said with a saccharine smile that froze when she saw his expression.

Andrew brushed past her without slowing.

"Andrew!" Nicole desperately grabbed his sleeve. "Our engagement ceremony is about to begin!"

"Let go." His voice was glacial.

Tears welled in Nicole's eyes. "You can't leave! Today is our—"

"Get lost!" Andrew shoved her aside and stormed out of the hotel.

The Koenigsegg's engine roared like a beast.

Andrew floored the accelerator, the speedometer needle spinning wildly.

Ethan sat in the passenger seat, nails digging bloody crescents into his palms.

A crowd had gathered outside Willow Lane apartments.

Fire truck sirens pierced the sky as thick smoke billowed from a sixth-floor window.

Andrew stood below, gaze locked on that window.

Their little nest—where he'd personally hung those pale blue curtains.

His legs gave out. Only by bracing against the car door did he avoid collapsing.

Ethan moved mechanically, like a dying old man.

Susan's sleeping face before he left haunted him. Regret gnawed at his heart like a venomous snake.

The sixth-floor door was charred beyond recognition.

Neither man could bring themselves to cross that threshold.

A blackened corpse lay under a fire blanket in the living room.

Fire marshals stepped aside wordlessly when they entered.

"This isn't her..." Ethan's trembling hands lifted the sheet—then he staggered back two steps.

Andrew stopped breathing.

The body was unrecognizable—charred skin cracked and peeling like burnt bark.

Her once-soft hair had turned to ash. Her features were a smudge of darkness.

"Susan..." Andrew fell to his knees, fingers hovering above the corpse but unable to touch.

Memories flooded him. Her weak voice on the phone: "Andrew, I'm going to die soon."

What had he said?

"Good. Hope you get reincarnated well."

"What, should I personally send you to your next life?!"

How he wished he could go back and strangle his cruel, stupid self.

But it was too late. His Susan was truly gone—reduced to this charred husk that would never smile, cry, or rage at him again.

Ethan suddenly threw himself onto the corpse, wailing like a child.

"Susan, wake up! I bought your favorite strawberry cake..."

Andrew slowly raised a hand, gently touching that ruined face.

Scalding tears hit the corpse with faint hisses.

In that moment, he finally understood true heartbreak.
###Chapter 142: Andrew Lucas's Heart Dies

"Susan, wake up!"

Andrew Lucas lunged at the charred corpse like a madman, his trembling fingers gripping its left wrist.

"No... Susan's left pinky was already missing..."

But the left hand of this corpse was unrecognizable—not only was the pinky gone, but the entire palm had been crushed beyond recognition.

"Andrew! Let her go!"

Ethan Sullivan charged forward with reddened eyes, only to be blocked by Andrew's sudden sidestep. The man cradled the corpse tightly in his arms, as if it were the most precious treasure in the world.

Seeing his friend's shattered state, Ethan suddenly loosened his grip.

He knew better than anyone who Susan had never been able to forget.

"Susan, I order you to open your eyes!"

Only silence answered him.

Andrew looked down at the blackened body in his arms, his fingertips lightly brushing the face that could no longer be recognized.

His Susan had always cared about her appearance.

He remembered how she would spend ages in front of the mirror before every date. He used to tell her she was naturally beautiful, but she would pout and argue, "A woman dresses for the one she loves. I want you to always see the best version of me."

And now, this face...

A searing pain tore through Andrew's chest.

His Susan had always been afraid of pain.

Once, she nicked her finger while peeling an apple—such a tiny cut had made her sulk for hours. And now...

Whispers from bystanders echoed in his ears:
"The screams lasted a full half-hour..."

How much had she suffered?

The phone call...

Right, she had called him.

The fire must have already been out of control by then. She had been trying to ask for his help...

And what had he said?

He said, "Good riddance."

He said, "Go find a better life in your next one."

"Susan... wake up..."

Andrew felt as though he were already dead—so why did his heart still hurt this much?

"Are you two relatives of Miss Susan Thompson?"

Two uniformed men entered the room.

"We're from the Organ Donation Center. Miss Thompson signed an agreement with us before her passing..."

Andrew's head snapped up, his bloodshot eyes sending the men stumbling back three steps.

"She—she took an advance of 700,000 to pay for her child's surgery..."

One of them mustered the courage to hand over the contract.

The black-and-white text burned Andrew's eyes.

He snatched the document and tore it to shreds.

"Get out! No one takes her away!"

"Y-yes, Mr. Lucas..."

Recognizing him, the two men paled instantly.

"700,000, right?"

Andrew suddenly laughed, the sound hoarse like sandpaper scraping.

"I'll pay you double."

700,000...

For just 700,000, she hadn't even left herself whole in death?

When she had asked to borrow money from him, he had thought...

Andrew buried his face in the corpse's charred hair, his shoulders shaking violently.

So she had truly been out of options.
###Chapter 143: Bringing Susan Home

A million dollars. Just the cost of one night's entertainment for him. Yet it had driven the woman he loved most to her death.

Sea burials were common in Seaview City—ashes scattered into the ocean depths. They'd discussed it once during happier times.

He remembered her wrinkling her nose in refusal. "Andrew, I'd get lost."

She always believed the dead should rest in the earth. Otherwise, their souls would lose their way in the afterlife. That foolish girl feared nothing more than being lost.

Yet to save Daniel's life, she'd given up even that final comfort. Signing the organ donation agreement meant she could never be buried properly. How desperate must she have been?

"Mr. Lucas—" The two attendants recoiled from the madness in his bloodshot eyes, fleeing in panic.

Andrew's trembling fingers traced Susan's charred face. "I'm taking you home."

His voice shattered. "You won't get lost. Wait for me... when I walk that road too."

The fire investigation pointed to arson. But with all surveillance footage destroyed, the case went cold.

The news faded quickly, leaving behind a tragic legend.

They said the Lucas heir abandoned his engagement for true love—only for his beloved to perish. He'd brushed her hair himself, placed the jade comb in her casket, and buried her with all the rites of a lawful wife.

Nicole Capra repeatedly denied the rumors, insisting the canceled engagement was due to her poor health. Her fans believed her—after all, who could imagine one woman captivating three elite bachelors simultaneously?

One month later, Lucas Corporation headquarters.

Leo Miller stared at his phone, fingers shaking. The headline screamed: "Nation's First Love Susan Thompson Stuns in New Perfume Campaign."

There she was—a vision in white, holding a perfume bottle, smiling among flowers. The very woman who'd supposedly burned to death a month ago.

Leo swallowed hard. Should he tell his already unhinged boss about this resurrected ex-wife?
###Chapter 144: The Phoenix Rises

Leo Miller stood before the CEO's office door, his palms damp with sweat.

He took a deep breath and lightly knocked on the heavy wooden door.

"Get in."

The voice inside was colder than ice. Leo's back stiffened instantly. He pushed the door open cautiously, as if disarming a time bomb.

The office was at least ten degrees colder than the hallway.

Andrew Lucas sat behind the expansive desk, his slender fingers signing documents. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, yet it only cast a frosty glow around him.

"Boss..."

"Speak."

The pen tip tore through the paper.

Leo swallowed hard. For the past month, Lucas Group had been walking on eggshells. Since the fire, Andrew had become a walking volcano, ready to erupt at any moment.

Last week, the marketing director had been demoted to the African branch for submitting a report ten minutes late.

"I... I saw Ms. Thompson."

The pen snapped in half.

Andrew slowly looked up, his dark eyes swirling with a terrifying storm. "Say that again."

Leo quickly handed over his phone.

On the screen, Susan Thompson stood in sunlight wearing a white dress, smiling softly as she held a perfume bottle. The headline beneath read: "Nation's First Love Susan Thompson Goes Viral Overnight—Netizens: The True Definition of an Ethereal Beauty."

Andrew's fingers trembled slightly.

A month ago, he had personally prepared her body, watched her cremation, and carried her urn home. Every night, he woke from nightmares of her being consumed by flames.

Yet now, she was alive in this photo, radiant as ever.

"Find her," Andrew's voice was hoarse with barely restrained fury. "I want to know where she is now."

Before Leo could respond, a new notification popped up: "King's Glory Endorsement Battle: Nation's First Love Susan Thompson vs. A-List Actress Nicole Capra."

The air turned to ice.

Andrew stared at the notification, his gaze darkening dangerously. A cold smirk twisted his lips as he tossed the phone back to Leo.

"Get the car ready."

"Where to, boss?"

"The King's Glory audition." Andrew stood, his suit jacket cutting through the air like a blade. "I want to see for myself how this 'Nation's First Love' came back from the dead."

Watching his boss stride away, Leo silently pitied Susan. This wasn't a reunion—it was the beginning of a warzone.
###Chapter 145: Susan, This Isn't Over!

"Explain clearly!"

Leo Miller swallowed hard. "Boss, Miss Susan Thompson has been invited to audition for King's Glory's spokesperson. Miss Nicole Capra is also on the list."

King's Glory, the national-level mobile game, was installed on nearly every phone in the country. Despite never having an official spokesperson before, it remained wildly popular nationwide.

When the Grant Group suddenly announced they would select a spokesperson, the entire entertainment industry erupted. Even paying for the opportunity, actresses fought tooth and nail to land this endorsement.

Becoming King's Glory's face meant over a hundred million players would see your image every time they opened the game. That kind of exposure could turn an unknown into an overnight sensation.

Though Nicole currently enjoyed rising fame, she still fell short of national sweethearts like Bella Lucas and Catherine Capra. The King's Glory endorsement was the springboard she desperately craved.

As soon as Leo finished speaking, Andrew Lucas's phone rang.

The caller ID displaying "Nicole Capra" made the man's brow furrow slightly, but he answered anyway.

"Andrew~" A sickeningly sweet voice cooed through the receiver. "Could you accompany me to the King's Glory audition this afternoon?"

Nicole had already investigated—among the auditioning actresses, she held the highest status. Bringing Andrew along would force the Grant family to show her some respect.

Since the fire incident, Andrew had been avoiding her. She'd made this call nervously, but after a brief silence, the man uttered a single word: "Fine."

"Andrew, I love you!" Nicole squealed, planting several kisses into the phone before hanging up.

Andrew set his phone down expressionlessly, though turbulent emotions churned beneath his calm exterior.

An audition, was it?

Susan Thompson, our reckoning isn't finished yet.

Susan was indeed alive.

After Daniel's fall from the cliff, he'd been rescued by Benjamin Nash, a renowned physician. The bloodstained clothes were from emergency treatment Benjamin performed at the cliff's base.

Not only had Benjamin saved Daniel's life, he'd completely cured the boy's severe thalassemia. Only the leg injuries from the fall required follow-up surgery—a procedure even Benjamin couldn't guarantee would succeed.

Benjamin took Daniel as his final apprentice. Upon waking, Daniel's first request was for his master to check on his mother.

By coincidence, when Benjamin arrived at Susan's apartment, it was engulfed in flames. The nearly seventy-year-old physician, remarkably agile, pulled Susan—barely alive—from the inferno.

Another woman lay unconscious in the living room, struck by a falling chandelier, but the flames allowed no time for a second rescue.

After a month under Benjamin's care, Susan's condition stabilized. With proper care, she might live another year.

One year was enough.

Once, she'd cursed her impending death for preventing her from making her enemies pay in blood. Now reborn, she'd make every one of them wish they were dead.

Sulfuric acid and knives were too merciful. True revenge destroyed the soul.

Whatever Nicole cherished most, Susan would obliterate. She'd drag that bitch from her gilded pedestal into the gutters where she belonged.

When the King's Glory audition invitation arrived, even Susan was surprised. As a minor influencer, landing such a prestigious opportunity seemed impossible.

Even more fortuitous—staff hinted Nicole was practically guaranteed the role.

A cold smile curled Susan's lips. The stolen Enchanted Love endorsement would be repaid with interest today.

Outside the dressing rooms, Susan came face-to-face with Nicole clinging to Andrew's arm. She walked past without a glance—until Andrew seized her wrist.
###Chapter 146: Mr. Lucas, Control Yourself!

Susan Thompson's wrist was locked in Andrew Lucas's iron grip.

She frowned and struggled, only to be met with even tighter restraint.

"Mr. Lucas, control yourself!" Her voice was icy.

Andrew's pupils constricted violently, his knuckles turning white.

"Susan, you're alive!"

His voice was hoarse, laced with suppressed fury and indescribable anguish.

A humorless smile curved Susan's lips.

"Yes, what a disappointment for you."

She deliberately shook her left hand, letting the hideous scar peek through.

Andrew's eyes instantly flooded with crimson.

"Susan!"

He slammed her against the wall, breathing heavily.

"Send you to your death myself? I wouldn't dirty my hands."

Susan laughed softly, her eyes glinting with mockery.

"Then what exactly are you doing now, Mr. Lucas?"

Her red lips were inches away. Andrew's Adam's apple bobbed.

Just as he was about to lose control, Nicole Capra's shrill voice pierced the air.

"Andrew!"

He snapped out of it and abruptly released Susan.

Nicole latched onto his arm, her nails digging into his flesh.

"The audition is starting."

Her saccharine voice concealed venom.

Susan smoothed her wrinkled sleeve, her gaze sweeping over Nicole's contorted face.

Daniel's cries still echoed in her ears.

Bella Quinn's blood stained her memories.

She would make Nicole pay a hundredfold.

The dressing room mirror reflected her frosty expression.

Her phone vibrated—a message from Benjamin Nash: Ethan Sullivan remains missing in Africa.

Susan clenched her fists.

Even without the young master of the Sullivan family's help, she would tear off Nicole's mask.

The audition hall buzzed with noise.

Susan sat in a corner reviewing the script, brow furrowed.

Swinging barefoot?

What kind of fetish did this director have?

A sudden commotion erupted at the entrance.

A man in a black suit walked in, his commanding presence silencing the room.

Susan looked up and met those fathomless eyes.

Alexander Grant.

Fate pivoted in that moment.
###Chapter 147: A Glimpse of Grace

Steven Cruz hunched slightly as he followed Alexander Grant, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

"Mr. Grant, this is Daisy Zade. She recently won the Golden Phoenix Award for Best Newcomer," Steven introduced, gesturing to the female celebrity swinging her feet on the garden swing.

Alexander's gaze swept over the feet adorned with red nail polish. "Her toes are too short."

Steven swallowed hard and silently crossed Daisy's name off the list.

The auditions that followed felt like a brutal elimination round.

"Legs aren't straight enough."
"Waistline is too rigid."
"Collarbones are asymmetrical."

Each critique cut like an icy blade. Steven's back was drenched in sweat. He stole a glance at the man seated at the center of the judges' panel—Alexander Grant, his long fingers tapping the table, impatience radiating from his expression.

Then came Nicole Capra's turn.

Steven's eyes lit up as if he'd found a lifeline. The heiress of the Capra family had opted for a classical aesthetic today—her dark hair cascaded like a waterfall, her sheer skirt swaying with the swing's motion, making her look ethereal amidst the dry ice mist.

"Mr. Grant, Miss Capra is engaged to Andrew Lucas. She has a strong fan base, and her image aligns perfectly with our game's theme—"

Alexander abruptly raised a hand to silence him. "Her feet are too wide."

Steven nearly bit his tongue. He stared at Nicole's delicate feet resting on flower petals—pale, slender, anything but wide.

Patrick Pope checked his watch and murmured, "Sir, you have the Asia-Pacific quarterly meeting next."

As Alexander stood, the stage lights dimmed abruptly. A spotlight illuminated the swing, revealing a pair of jade-white ankles. The feet were petite and exquisitely shaped, with a graceful arch and nails glowing a healthy pink.

The man froze mid-step.

Steven followed his gaze to an unfamiliar girl stepping barefoot onto the stage. She wore a simple white dress, her raven-black hair falling to her waist, half-hidden in the mist.

But it was her feet that captivated—no larger than a size six, with adorable rounded toes that gleamed like fine alabaster under the lights.

Alexander's eyes darkened.

Patrick moved to urge him along, only to see his boss turn and reclaim his seat, gaze locked onto the stage. "Continue."

Steven gaped. Hadn't this man claimed to be in a hurry mere moments ago?

On stage, Susan Thompson remained oblivious to the attention. She swayed gently on the swing, her dress fluttering to reveal slender ankles. Sunlight filtered through leaves, casting dappled patterns over her like a woodland sprite.

Suddenly, Alexander raised his hand. "Stop."

Silence fell. The man stood, his black suit accentuating his tall frame. He strode to the stage's edge, eyes burning as they fixed on those porcelain feet.

"She's the one."
###Chapter 148: Susan Thompson, Shockingly Hideous!

Alexander Grant's breath hitched.

He saw a pair of delicate feet swaying gently on the swing, a silver anklet tinkling softly with each movement. The porcelain skin glowed like pearls under the sunlight, dazzling his eyes.

His heart suddenly raced out of control.

He pressed a hand to his chest, but couldn't suppress the unfamiliar flutter. It wasn't an illness, yet it struck more fiercely than any disease.

"Boss?" Patrick Pope's voice sounded distant.

Alexander didn't hear him. His gaze remained locked on those feet, watching them trace graceful arcs with each sway of the swing. The glimpse of slender ankles beneath the fluttering chiffon made his throat tighten.

"I'll get the car!" Patrick said, only to realize Alexander hadn't moved.

Following his boss's stare, Patrick sucked in a sharp breath.

The woman on stage—Susan Thompson—was shockingly hideous!

Patrick had never seen Alexander so unhinged. The man was known for his impenetrable composure. For him to be this transfixed, how grotesque must this woman be?

"Boss, are you okay?" Patrick asked cautiously.

Alexander still didn't respond.

Patrick sighed. "That Susan Thompson on stage is downright repulsive. I'll have her blacklisted immediately. She won't taint your sight again."

As he pulled out his phone, he glanced at the stage—then dropped the device with a clatter.

That was no monstrosity. She was a mesmerizing siren.

Susan descended from the swing with deliberate grace. Her expression was cool, yet an innate allure radiated from her very bones. The contradiction of icy detachment and bewitching charm was impossible to look away from.

Alexander finally found his voice. "Patrick, my heart is racing."

The dialing hand froze. Patrick's face turned red with suppressed laughter. "Boss, is this... your first crush?"

"Nonsense!" Alexander snapped, but his eyes betrayed him, trailing after that enchanting figure.

Meanwhile, Andrew Lucas's expression darkened like storm clouds.

His glare burned into Susan's exposed ankles, fury churning in his chest. How dare she flaunt herself like this in public—

"Vincent!" Candy Wilson's panicked voice cut through. "The jade bracelet Grandma gave me—it's gone!"

Her eyes reddened as she explained, "It's the King family heirloom for daughters-in-law. I kept it safe in my bag..."

The hall erupted into murmurs. Candy frantically scanned the room. "It's a white jade bracelet. Please, everyone, help me look for it!"

Vincent King frowned and stepped forward. "Don't worry. We'll find it."

But Andrew's attention snagged on something else—Susan was subtly backing away, as if preparing to leave. His eyes narrowed, and he strode toward her.
###Chapter 149: Susan Thompson, the Shameless Thief!

Tears streamed down Candy Wilson's face like broken pearls. She looked around helplessly. "My bracelet is missing... It's a family heirloom given to me by Andrew's grandmother..."

The air in the hall instantly froze.

All conversations ceased as suspicious glances darted between guests. Susan noticed Candy's gaze lingering subtly on her purse.

"Please help me," Candy pleaded with a trembling voice. "That bracelet means everything to me..."

Nicole Capra immediately stepped forward. "Don't worry, Candy. We'll find it."

Susan's fingers tightened unconsciously. She recognized this setup all too well—a classic frame job.

"Why doesn't everyone check their belongings?" Nicole suggested, her eyes locked onto Susan.

The ladies began rummaging through their purses to prove their innocence. Susan remained motionless, feeling the weight of scrutinizing stares.

"Miss Thompson," a red-gowned actress spoke up pointedly. "Your purse remains unchecked."

Whispers surged like tidal waves.

"Guilty conscience?"
"These influencers have no class..."
"Thief pretending to be noble..."

Susan straightened her spine. Her icy gaze swept the crowd. "I stole nothing."

Candy rushed over to grasp her hand. "Susan, I'm not accusing you... But what if someone accidentally—"

"Accidentally planted evidence in my bag?" Susan shook her off, her voice glacial.

Vincent King's attention never left Susan. Seeing this, Candy quickly clung to his arm. "Vincent, you know how much that bracelet means to me..."

Nicole seized the moment to fan flames. "Just let everyone see, sister. Innocence needs no defense."

"Exactly!" The red-gowned actress lunged forward and snatched Susan's purse.

Before Susan could react, the woman publicly dumped the contents.

Tissues, lipstick, phone... Then a carefully wrapped bundle.

With dramatic flair, the actress unwrapped it—revealing a white jade bracelet.

"It was her all along!"
"Disgusting!"
"She deserves to be a brand ambassador?"

More shocking—a folded stack of papers peeked from the purse. As the actress reached for them, Susan swiftly reclaimed her bag.

"Had enough drama?" Susan's quiet voice silenced the room.

She slowly raised the bracelet, examining it under the light. "Miss Wilson, you're certain this is your heirloom?"

Candy's face paled. "Of... of course..."

Susan suddenly smiled. "Then why does it bear the character 'Su'—not 'Candy'?"
###Chapter 150: The Mysterious Man Behind Susan

Megan York's fingers trembled slightly as she clutched the stack of papers.

She narrowed her eyes and deliberately rustled the sheets with a loud flourish.

"A Sugar Daddy Agreement?" Her voice dripped with sarcasm, sharp enough to pierce eardrums.

The room fell into instant silence.

Megan lifted her chin triumphantly, jabbing her finger against the paper.

"Mr. Kevin Oak agrees to pay Miss Susan Thompson a monthly allowance of one hundred thousand yuan..." She paused dramatically, scanning the crowd.

"My, my. Who would've thought?"

Gasps rippled through the audience.

"Article Two," Megan suddenly covered her mouth in mock surprise.

"Special requests of a... particular taste?" She shook her hand in disgust.

"How revolting."

Several actresses immediately pulled out wet wipes, frantically scrubbing their seats.

Susan's nails dug deep into her palms.

She stared at the forged document, her chest heaving violently.

"Article Three is even juicier," Megan waved the papers theatrically.

"Bring your own props? Costumes? Leather—" She suddenly flung the papers to the ground as if touching something filthy.

Candy Wilson's eyes reddened on cue.

"Megan, please..." She reached out timidly.

"Susan isn't that kind of person..."

"The evidence is right here!" Megan snatched the jade bracelet.

"Who knows how many things she's stolen!"

The crowd erupted in whispers.

"Selling herself for a hundred grand?"

"How dare she call herself an influencer?"

"Someone call the police!"

Vincent King suddenly pushed through the crowd.

His face was stormy as he grabbed Susan's wrist.

"Explain." His voice was dangerously low, simmering with fury.

Susan laughed coldly.

"Explain what? Your carefully laid trap?"

Candy suddenly threw herself forward.

"Susan, I know you need money..." Tears streamed down her face.

"I can help you..."

The doors swung open at that moment.

A balding man with a beer belly walked in, rubbing his hands together.

"Susan, is the audition over?" His beady eyes gleamed with oily amusement.

"I'm here to take you home."

The room exploded in uproar.
###Chapter 151: Susan's Self-Degradation

Susan frowned slightly as she looked at the greasy-faced man before her.

She was certain she'd never met him before.

Noticing the Sugar Daddy Agreement in Megan York's hand from the corner of her eye, realization dawned.

This man calling himself Kevin Oak was the so-called benefactor mentioned in the document.

Nicole Capra and Candy Wilson's scheme was truly well-orchestrated.

"Sweet Susan, coming to my place tonight?" Kevin squinted his triangular eyes, letting his gaze roam over her body. "I just bought a massage chair—guaranteed to make you feel good."

He reached out to grab Susan's waist, but she sidestepped smoothly.

"Susan, why the evasion?" Kevin looked genuinely puzzled. "Last week you were throwing yourself into my arms. Why play hard to get now?"

Nicole seized the moment to interject: "Andrew, how could she degrade herself like this? I must talk some sense into her!"

Andrew Lucas' expression darkened as if storm clouds had gathered.

The temperature in the banquet hall seemed to plummet.

"Susan," his voice was icy, "exactly how many sugar daddies do you have?"

Ignoring Andrew, Susan turned to Kevin. "Sir, we've never met."

"Susan!" Kevin raised his voice abruptly. "Just last night you called me 'darling'! Now you're pretending not to know me?"

"Sir, please behave yourself." Susan's tone remained calm.

Kevin's face twisted. He puffed out his beer belly. "Susan, I pay you $10,000 a month, and this is how you repay me?"

"You begged me to sign that agreement! Now that you're famous, you want to dump me? Without my support, you're nothing!"

Nicole feigned distress. "Andrew, help her! If this gets out, how will she face anyone?"

Andrew stared at Susan, his eyes screaming one word: Beg.

Susan smirked.

Beg? Like she used to, groveling pathetically?

That weak Susan who let others trample over her was long gone.

"Mr. Oak," Susan lifted her chin, "I suggest you take a good look in the mirror first."

"Being kept by you?" She laughed lightly. "I, Susan Thompson, am not that desperate."

"The men I want—I'd gladly take for free. The ones I don't..." Her gaze swept across the room. "No mountain of gold could tempt me."

Kevin's face turned ashen.

But Vincent King's expression was even uglier.

He suddenly sneered. "Susan, still playing innocent after signing the agreement? You stole Candy's bracelet—you owe us an explanation!"

"Otherwise," his eyes turned vicious, "I'll make sure you spend the rest of your life in prison."

A bitter smile touched Susan's lips.

Being treated this way by a once-close friend hurt more than she cared to admit.

"None of you believe me," she said softly. "But I'll say it anyway—my conscience is clear."

"This world is vast. Someone will believe me."

Just as murmurs spread through the crowd, a deep, resonant voice cut through:

"I believe you."
###Chapter 152: Alexander Grant Trusts Susan Thompson

Susan turned abruptly, her gaze landing on the tall, imposing figure striding toward the stage.

She never expected that when everyone doubted her, the first person to stand up and believe in her would be a complete stranger.

Alexander Grant rarely appeared in the media, and Susan didn’t even know his name.

Yet the commanding aura around him inexplicably put her at ease.

Beneath that cold exterior must lie a passionate heart—why else would he choose to trust her amidst all the chaos?

For someone long doubted, sudden trust was overwhelming.

Susan’s nose tingled, her eyes burning.

She was always like this—easily moved by the smallest warmth.

"Thank you," she said with a bright smile, extending her hand toward Alexander.

"Thank you for believing in me."

Patrick Pope, standing beside Alexander, sucked in a sharp breath.

Everyone knew the Grant heir despised women getting too close.

This little influencer was about to regret it.

But the next second, Patrick’s jaw nearly dropped—his boss actually took her hand.

"Boss, are you okay?" Patrick asked nervously.

The last time a socialite hugged Alexander, he nearly threw up his stomach.

Alexander ignored him.

The small hand in his palm was impossibly soft, making him tighten his grip instinctively.

"Ouch..." Susan gasped.

Only then did Alexander loosen his hold, his deep gaze fixed on her face.

"Susan Thompson, welcome as the new face of King’s Glory."

Susan froze.

So he was from the game company?

The sudden good news made her heart race.

Now Nicole Capra and the others couldn’t steal this endorsement from her.

But just then, an icy glare burned the back of her hand.

She turned and met Andrew Lucas’s stormy expression—as if he’d been publicly cuckolded.

"Psycho," Susan mouthed silently.

Andrew’s face darkened further.

"What? Susan’s still the ambassador?" Megan York shrieked.

"She’s a kept woman and a thief! Aren’t you afraid of backlash?"

Patrick’s expression turned grim, but before he could react, Kevin Oak charged forward.

"Susan! Your contract states all work requires my approval! Come with me now!"

He reached for Susan, only to be thrown over Alexander’s shoulder and slammed to the ground.

"You dare touch me?" Kevin scrambled up, cursing.

"Do you know who I am?"

Steven Cruz slapped his hand away.

"Disrespecting Alexander Grant? You’ve got a death wish?"

Alexander Grant?!

The room fell silent instantly.

Megan frantically touched up her makeup while other actresses adjusted their appearances.

Kevin collapsed back onto the floor.

But Alexander only had eyes for Andrew.

"Andrew Lucas. Long time no see."

"Likewise," Andrew replied, though his gaze remained fixed on Susan.

Megan struck her most elegant pose.

"Mr. Grant, I only say this for your sake. Susan’s reputation is ruined—she’ll destroy King’s Glory. Please reconsider the ambassador choice!"
###Chapter 153: Vincent, Apologize to Susan!

Megan York finished speaking and threw Alexander Grant a flirtatious glance.

Alexander finally turned his gaze toward her face.

Megan instantly forgot her tough-girl persona. Her cheeks flushed pink as she lowered her head like a bashful mimosa.

"Prince Alexander..."

Suppressing his disgust, Alexander spoke with deliberate slowness. "For King's Glory spokesperson, we'll replace Susan Thompson... with you?"

Megan's eyes lit up. She never expected such fortune to fall into her lap.

She coyly twisted her fingers. "Young Master Alexander, you're teasing me."

Alexander's gaze slowly traveled downward, landing on her bare feet.

Thinking he was admiring her, Megan couldn't resist wiggling her toes.

"The King's Glory spokesperson should have bare feet, not roasted pig trotters!"

Megan's face turned deathly pale.

Snickers erupted around them.

Candy Wilson cursed the useless woman internally before stepping forward herself.

With practiced vulnerability, she said, "Prince Alexander, Susan must be innocent. Even if she did take my bracelet, I forgive her."

Susan smirked. "Candy, had enough acting?"

"How could you think that of me..." Candy's eyes instantly welled up. "That bracelet was left to me by Grandma. How could I use it to frame you?"

"Because the dressing room has surveillance." Susan checked her watch. "I knew you'd come. I took precautions."

Candy's expression changed abruptly.

Vincent King suddenly barked, "Susan!"

His eyes burned with fury. "A woman like you has no right to act so superior!"

Alexander suddenly pressed a hand to his chest and strode toward Vincent.

The two men stood toe-to-toe, tension crackling between them.

"Vincent King." Alexander's voice was icy. "If Susan is innocent, you will apologize to her."
###Chapter 154: The Truth Revealed

"Hah!"

Vincent King let out a cold laugh, his usually gentle face now dark with fury. "Alexander Grant, how can a woman kept by a man claim to be innocent?"

"Alexander, I suggest you open your eyes. A woman's most deceptive weapon is her face!"

"Mark my words today—if Susan Thompson is truly innocent, I'll let her do whatever she wants with me!"

"Pull up the surveillance footage." Alexander had been waiting for this moment. Though it was his first time meeting Susan, he inexplicably trusted her. The feeling made no sense, yet he embraced it without question.

Patrick moved swiftly, retrieving the footage from the dressing room.

The screen showed Susan changing in the fitting room, her handbag hanging on a rack outside. Candy's handbag sat on a nearby table.

When the room was empty, Megan York crept in, glancing around furtively.

"Turn it off! Stop it now!" Megan shrieked, lunging for the monitor, only to be blocked by Patrick.

The footage clearly captured Megan taking the bracelet from Candy's bag and slipping it into Susan's. She also stuffed a stack of papers inside before zipping it shut and leaving.

"That's not what happened!" Megan screamed hysterically.

The hall erupted in chaos.

"Oh my God! We were all fooled!"

"Megan is disgusting! She acted so righteous earlier!"

"She's the one who should be blacklisted!"

Megan turned to Candy in panic, but Candy spoke first, feigning disappointment. "Megan, how could you frame Susan like this? I'm so disappointed in you."

Megan opened her mouth, then lowered her head. "Susan... I'm sorry. I was just... jealous of you."

Susan watched calmly. She had expected Candy wouldn’t dirty her own hands. But there would be time for reckoning later.

Alexander turned his cold gaze to Vincent. "Vincent, it's time to honor your word."

Vincent stared at Susan's delicate face, suddenly remembering the heartbreak he'd felt a month ago upon hearing news of her death. Now, it all seemed laughable.

"Susan... I apologize." His words were icy and perfunctory.

Susan ignored him, turning instead to Alexander with genuine gratitude. "Mr. Grant, thank you."

"Really want to thank me?" Alexander asked, the words slipping out before he could stop himself.
###Chapter 155: Andrew's Jealousy

The moment Alexander Grant finished speaking, the entire hall fell so silent you could hear a pin drop.

Patrick Pope's eyes widened. The folder in his hand clattered to the floor. He mechanically bent to pick it up, his mind reeling—his CEO, who never showed interest in women, had just asked a woman out to dinner?

Susan Thompson froze. She had only been politely expressing gratitude, never expecting such a direct response. She instinctively touched the tip of her nose and murmured, "Of course, it's true."

"Then it's settled for the evening after tomorrow." Alexander glanced at his wristwatch. "Seven o'clock. I'll pick you up."

Susan nodded, though inwardly she sighed in relief. At least it wasn't tomorrow—she still had to endure that blind date arranged by Dr. Nash.

She hurried out of the hall, her thoughts consumed by picking up Daniel. The sensitive little boy was attending kindergarten for the first time today, and she worried about how he was adjusting.

Patrick stood rooted in place until Susan's figure disappeared. Then, as if snapping out of a daze, he whipped out his phone. "Steven? Cancel all of the CEO's appointments for the evening after tomorrow."

A confused voice came through the line. "But there's the—"

"Cancel everything!" Patrick hissed. "The CEO has a date!"

In a shadowed corner of the hall, Andrew Lucas crushed a glass in his hand without expression. Crimson droplets trailed between his fingers, yet he didn't seem to notice.

Nicole Capra had already left for a work commitment. Megan York deliberately lingered until the end, only to find Andrew leaning against his car outside.

"What's your name?" His icy tone sent a shiver down Megan's spine.

She lowered her eyes coyly. "Megan York..."

"Good." Andrew's lips curled into a cold smirk as he pulled out his phone. "Leo, blacklist an actress named Megan York."

Megan's face paled. Before she could react, Andrew repeated her earlier insults toward Susan word for word. "So she doesn't keep buzzing around like a fly, annoying everyone."

Her legs gave out, and she collapsed to the ground, watching helplessly as his tall figure strode away.

Susan arrived late at the kindergarten, frantically searching for her pick-up card when a strong hand suddenly yanked her into a black sedan.

The man's scorching breath engulfed her as he pinned her firmly against the seat.

"Andrew!" she gasped, but his lips crashed onto hers before she could say another word.
###Chapter 156: Andrew's Obsession

"Let go!"

Susan Thompson looked up into Andrew Lucas's burning eyes.

She found the situation utterly absurd. Being dragged into a car and pinned down—she was the one who should be furious.

"Susan, is playing with me amusing?"

"Mr. Lucas, I don't understand what you're talking about!" She pushed against him, but he didn't budge.

"Susan, you didn't die in that fire!"

Dark fury swirled in Andrew's gaze. "Was faking your death fun? Did you enjoy watching me suffer like a fool?"

"You're being unreasonable!" She struggled, but his grip on her wrist tightened.

"First you fake your death to haunt me, then you seduce Alexander Grant. You're quite skilled, Susan."

She scoffed. "Mr. Lucas, who do you think you are? I can be with whoever I want. It's none of your business."

"Get out of my life! Never let me see you again!"

The words "never again" stabbed at Andrew. He remembered clutching that charred body a month ago, his heart tearing apart.

Grief and rage collided. He seized her and crushed his lips against hers.

"You're insane!" Susan paled.

They were outside a kindergarten. Daniel would be out soon.

Though the car windows were tinted, shame burned through her.

"Andrew, Daniel is coming!"

The name made him freeze.

He turned toward the school entrance. A line of children filed out, Daniel's limping figure painfully conspicuous.

Seeing the scratches on the boy's face, Andrew's chest ached.

This child had survived—but as a cripple. And it was all because he had chosen Nicole Capra.

Seizing his distraction, Susan shoved him away, straightened her clothes, and bolted from the car.

As she turned, her eyes stung.

She hadn't expected their reunion to nearly repeat the past.

But this Susan was different. She took a deep breath, forcing back tears.

Andrew, dying once taught me that loving you was my greatest weakness. Now, I'll cut that weakness away myself.

She forced a smile and opened her arms for Daniel—only to freeze at the sight of his injuries.

"Daniel, what happened to your face?"

Holding his hand, she saw the vicious cuts and bite marks. Lifting his sleeve revealed bruises covering his arm.

Tears finally fell.

"Tell me, who hurt you?"

Daniel managed a weak smile. "Mom, I'm okay..."

"Mrs. Almond!" A shrill voice interrupted. "Make your son apologize to mine!"
###Chapter 157: Daniel is a Fatherless Crippled Idiot!

The word "cripple" stabbed into Susan Thompson's heart like a knife.

She whirled around, icy gaze locking onto the bejeweled woman before her. The woman's garishly painted red nails clutched the hand of a sneering little boy.

"Mommy! He hit me!" The boy pointed at Daniel, wailing dramatically as sunlight glinted off the barely visible scratch on his face. "This cripple hurt me so bad!"

The woman immediately cradled her son's face. "Don't cry, baby. Mommy will teach this ill-bred cripple a lesson!"

Daniel clenched Susan's sleeve, his small face tight with tension.

Susan's chest burned with fury as she saw the vivid bruises on her son's arm. Her lips curled into a cold smile. "Your son should be the one apologizing."

"What did you say?" The woman shrieked, her nails nearly scratching Susan's face. "Look at my son's injury! Shameless woman, raising a fatherless cripple like this!"

Daniel suddenly broke free from Susan's grip, limping forward. "Don't talk about my mommy like that!"

"Stupid cripple!" The boy stuck out his tongue. "You walk like a duck! Your mommy's a homewrecker, that's why your daddy left you!"

Susan's pupils constricted. Such venomous words couldn't possibly come from a four-year-old's mind.

The woman lifted her chin triumphantly. "Do you know who my husband is? Steven Cruz! Director of King's Glory! Apologize now or you'll never survive in Seacity!"

As she spoke, a sharply dressed man approached. Steven froze momentarily upon seeing Susan, then straightened under his wife's murderous glare. "Ms. Thompson, have your son apologize and we'll let this go."

Before Susan could respond, a black Rolls-Royce glided to a silent stop at the crowd's periphery.

The door opened, revealing Alexander Grant's tall frame. His icy gaze swept over Steven. "Director Cruz wields impressive authority."

Steven's face turned deathly pale.

Meanwhile, Andrew Lucas stood frozen nearby, his knuckles whitening around the car door handle. His stormy eyes burned into Alexander's hand resting on Susan's shoulder.
###Chapter 158: He Couldn't Resist Protecting Susan

Andrew Lucas held a cigarette between his fingers, his expression dark and brooding through the haze of smoke.

Steven Cruz's arrogant smirk froze when Alexander Grant suddenly appeared.

"Mr. Grant... I..."

"Shut it!" The woman beside Steven stomped her foot in frustration at her husband's cowardice. She pointed viciously at Susan. "You shameless homewrecker, dragging around your crippled bastard—who gave you the right to bully my son? Get on your knees and apologize now!"

The crowd grew but no one dared intervene.

Alexander's lips parted. "Who should kneel?"

The woman sized him up, emboldened when she assumed he had no connection to Susan and her son. "This slut and her crippled brat, of course! Serves her right for being abandoned after birthing a defective child!"

"Yeah! Fatherless cripple!" The boy stuck out his tongue from behind his mother. "Freak! Nobody wants you!"

"Who said he has no father?" Alexander's voice turned glacial.

Steven forced a nervous laugh. "Mr. Grant, this child's background is unclear—"

"I am his father."

The air turned to ice.

Steven's legs trembled, sweat dripping down his back. "Y-you must be joking..."

Alexander's gaze made him feel like he'd fallen into an abyss.

The woman finally recognized who stood before them, her face draining of color.

Susan stared at Alexander in shock, but his expression remained unreadable.

"Mr. Grant..." she whispered.

Even Alexander himself was startled. He despised personal entanglements, yet here he was, willingly shielding this mother and child.

"Apologize," Alexander commanded coldly.

Steven dropped to his knees. "I was blind! The young master is clearly gifted—"

"Dad!" The boy whined. "He's just a cripple!"

Steven clamped a hand over his son's mouth, forcing a strained smile. "Kids say the darndest things..."

"Apologize to Susan," Alexander enunciated each word.
###Chapter 159: Cooking for Her

"Ms. Thompson, little Daniel, we were wrong!" Steven Cruz trembled violently, slapping his own face hard. "Please show us mercy!"

His wife stood pale, her lips quivering. "It was all just a joke—we meant no harm!"

"Mom! Dad!" The little boy suddenly broke free from his mother's grip. "You said you'd make them beg on their knees!"

Steven hastily covered his son's mouth, raising his hand but unable to bring himself to strike.

Susan Thompson swept her cold gaze over the family of three before settling on the boy.

"Listen, little one. Daniel's legs were injured, but he's more remarkable than anyone." She crouched to meet his eyes. "Mocking someone's weakness is the lowest thing you can do."

The boy pouted defiantly. "But he walks like a duck!"

"How would you feel if someone laughed at you like that?"

After a long silence, the boy finally lowered his head. "Not good..."

"Then you should apologize."

The boy shuffled awkwardly before stepping toward Daniel. "Daniel Almond... I'm sorry." He tugged at his shirt hem. "Maybe... we can be friends?"

Daniel extended his small hand. "I forgive you."

Watching the two boys reconcile, Susan felt a warmth in her chest. Children weren't born cruel—their behavior reflected their parents' guidance.

"Get in the car." Alexander Grant's tone brooked no argument as he lifted Daniel into his arms.

Susan opened her mouth to protest, but Daniel was already settled in the backseat. Reluctantly, she slid in beside him.

To her shock, Alexander squeezed into the back as well, the confined space making her breath hitch.

"Mr. Grant!" Steven clung to the car window, pleading. "I've learned my lesson!"

"Your annual bonus is revoked." Alexander's voice was ice.

Steven nearly collapsed with relief, bowing repeatedly. Turning to embrace his wife, his eyes suddenly reddened. Years of indulgence had nearly destroyed his family.

Andrew Lucas stood in the shadows, the cigarette between his fingers long burnt out. He watched Alexander claim Daniel as his son. Watched their "family of three" drive away.

Only when the ember seared his palm did he snap back to reality.

As the Rolls-Royce entered the residential complex, Andrew found himself following like a man possessed. He waited beneath their window for two agonizing hours.

"Brother." His voice was hoarse when he dialed the number. "Get Alexander away. Now."

Hanging up, he stared at the lit window and drove his fist into the concrete wall. Blood dripped unnoticed from his knuckles.

When Alexander finally left, Andrew marched upstairs.

The doorbell rang. Assuming Alexander had returned for his coat, Susan opened the door without hesitation.

Their eyes locked. The air froze.

Andrew's gaze swept past her to the dining table—six dishes and a soup, each perfectly prepared.

The woman who'd once never lifted a finger in the kitchen was now cooking elaborate meals for another man.

His vision burned crimson.
###Chapter 160: Susan, Why Couldn't It Be You Who Died?

"Susan Thompson, who gave you permission to cook for Alexander Grant?!" Andrew Lucas kicked open the apartment door, his eyes burning with terrifying rage.

Instinctively, I shielded Daniel behind me and lifted my cold gaze. "Mr. Lucas, you're not welcome here."

He seized my wrist with bone-crushing force. "You shameless woman! Would you stoop so low just to seduce a man?"

"Let go!" I struggled violently, but he slammed me against the wall.

Alexander Grant subtly moved Daniel behind him, his voice icy. "Mr. Lucas, control yourself."

"Control?" Andrew's laugh turned grotesque. "Alexander Grant, who do you think you are? How dare you touch my woman?"

I wrenched my hand free. "Andrew Lucas, we have no relationship anymore!"

"No relationship?" He grabbed my chin. "Susan, you still owe me a debt!"

Daniel suddenly rushed forward, pounding Andrew's leg. "Don't hurt Mommy!"

Andrew looked down at the child he'd once abandoned, something flickering in his eyes. "Bastard, get lost!"

"Andrew Lucas!" I snapped. "You have no right to call him that!"

"Right?" He sneered. "Susan, tell me—whose seed is this? Henry Bartley's? Victor Thompson's? Or..." His venomous gaze shifted to Alexander, "this CEO Grant?"

My entire body trembled with fury. "None of your business!"

"None of my business?" He exploded, yanking my collar open. "If you love seducing men so much, why not repay your debt right now?"

"Stop!" Alexander moved forward but was blocked by Andrew's bodyguards.

I stared at the man I'd once loved. "Andrew Lucas, you disgust me."

"Disgust?" He whispered in my ear, "That's not what you said that night at the hotel."

I raised my hand to slap him, but he caught it effortlessly. "Susan, the more you resist, the more I'll make you suffer."

"Why?" My eyes burned as I demanded, "Why torture me like this?"

His gaze darkened, voice trembling imperceptibly. "Because... I wish it had been you who died."

The words stabbed through my heart like a knife.

I suddenly laughed. "Funny. I wish I'd died too. Then I wouldn't have to see this vile side of you."

Andrew's pupils contracted, his grip loosening slightly.

Alexander seized the moment to pull me behind him. "Mr. Lucas, enough."

Andrew stared at our joined hands, the storm in his eyes intensifying. "Susan, you're truly despicable."

"Yes, I am." I met his gaze calmly. "So do us both a favor and spare me your filthy touch."

He abruptly choked me. "You think clinging to the Grants will save you? Dream on!"

As suffocation set in, I smiled wider. "Andrew... what... are you afraid of?"

He released me like I'd burned him, face twisted.

Rubbing my throat, I coughed. "Afraid I'll love someone else? Or afraid..." I locked eyes with him, "you can't let me go?"

"Ridiculous!" He cut me off sharply. "Susan, women like you don't deserve love!"

"Perfect." I turned to take Daniel's hand. "We don't need your charity."

Andrew stood frozen, watching our retreating backs, knuckles cracking.

"Susan!" He suddenly roared. "You think this is over?"

I didn't look back. "It ended the moment you chose to believe Nicole Capra."

As the door closed, something heavy smashed against the wall.

Alexander handed me a glass of water. "Need help?"

I shook my head, watching Daniel sleep. "Some battles must be fought alone."

Outside, lightning split the sky—just like that stormy night four years ago.

Only this time, I wouldn't shed tears for anyone.
###Chapter 161 Daniel's Biological Father is Dead!

The sound of tearing fabric shattered the silence.

Susan Thompson's face turned deathly pale.

Andrew Lucas knew full well that the scandalous "sugar daddy" incident from earlier was a setup, yet he still used it to humiliate her.

In his eyes, she would always be unforgivable.

"Andrew, let go!"

As she struggled, Daniel's furious voice suddenly rang out.

"Monster! Don't hurt Mommy!"

Susan froze.

Thankfully, though her collar was torn, she wasn't exposed.

Andrew clearly hadn't expected Daniel to appear, hesitating momentarily.

Susan seized the chance to break free, stumbling toward her son.

"Does it hurt, Mommy?" Daniel looked up anxiously, tiny fists clutching her clothes.

"I'm fine." She ruffled his hair. "Mommy's strong."

Turning to Andrew, her voice turned icy.

"I'll repay what I owe you. From now on, we're even."

She pulled a wad of cash from her bag and threw it at his chest.

"One thousand now. I'll account for every penny so you can't claim I cheated you."

"Susan!"

Andrew clutched the money, eyes burning crimson.

Those flimsy bills struck his heart like knives.

He sneered. "A thousand? For a million-dollar debt?"

"I said I'll pay gradually." Susan tightened her grip on Daniel's hand. She still owed the research institute and couldn't pay more now.

But this year, she'd work herself to the bone to repay faster.

She refused to leave debts that would shame Daniel.

Daniel suddenly wrenched free and limped in front of her.

"Pick on me instead! Bullying women is cowardly!"

Hatred burned in his eyes as he staggered to the door. "Get out!"

Veins bulged on Andrew's hands.

Guilt surged like a tide at the sight of that frail figure, then was brutally suppressed.

That bastard deserved to die.

"One month to repay." His smile turned cruel. "Or I'll show the world how filthy you are."

Turning, he looked down at Daniel.

"Control your cripple. Anger me, and I'll gladly kill him again."

The door slammed shut.

Susan trembled violently.

Others calling Daniel a cripple she could bear—but from his own father?

A sharp pain stabbed her stomach as she pulled Daniel close.

"Mommy..." His voice shook. "I know I'm lame, but hearing him say it... it hurts."

Her heart shattered.

"Mommy, is he really my dad?" Daniel looked up, eyes glistening. "No, I have no father. He... died long ago."

"The day he fell off that cliff, he died in my heart."

"Daniel!" She crushed him in an embrace. "We have each other."

"Yeah!" He wiped his tears fiercely. "I have the best mommy ever!"

Susan's throat tightened.

What kind of mother was she? She couldn't even promise to watch him grow up.

"You promised to buy me toys!" Daniel suddenly beamed, as if the storm had never happened.

"Let's go now."

Downtown, the mall glittered brightly.

Susan picked up a tiny suit jacket—then turned to find Daniel gone.
###Chapter 162: Susan is the Real Candy!

"Daniel!"

The empty children's clothing store echoed with only the confused gaze of a sales associate.

Susan's heart plummeted. She had merely stood on tiptoe to grab an outfit, but when she turned around, Daniel was gone.

Her fingers trembled uncontrollably as she forced herself to stay calm.

"Daniel has a kids' phone..."

When the call connected, Susan nearly burst into tears.

"Mommy, I'm in..." Daniel glanced around, "...the underground parking garage."

"Don't move! I'm coming right now!"

Without asking why, Susan grabbed her purse and bolted outside.

Daniel wasn't the type to wander off. He'd left because he'd spotted a familiar figure in the crowd.

Vincent King.

The man who once cradled him while teaching him to write his name.

Dragging his unsteady leg, Daniel struggled to follow that retreating back. He had to know why Uncle Murphy hadn't visited him in so long.

"Uncle Murphy!"

The garage's acoustics made Vincent pause mid-step.

Candy Wilson clung to his arm, eyeing Daniel curiously. "Is this child calling you?"

Vincent frowned, his gaze icy and unfamiliar. "Don't know him."

He turned to leave.

"Uncle Murphy!" Daniel's voice cracked as he stumbled forward, falling hard onto the concrete.

His knees burned, but he ignored the pain.

"I'm Daniel!" The boy's voice quivered. "You taught me to write my name... sang 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' for me..."

Vincent's footsteps faltered. An inexplicable heaviness settled in his chest.

"I don't know you," he stated coldly.

Candy crouched down with a saccharine smile. "Little boy, lying isn't nice. Who's your mother?"

"Susan Thompson!" Daniel lifted his chin defiantly. "My mom is Susan Thompson!"

Candy's smile froze momentarily.

"Vincent, let's go," she murmured. "This child must have mistaken you for someone else."

As Vincent opened the car door, Daniel suddenly shouted, "She's not Candy! My mom is! You always called her Candy!"

The name "Candy" acted like a key, sending a sharp throb through Vincent's temples.

He turned back, meeting Daniel's red-rimmed eyes.

"Uncle Murphy..." The boy's whisper was barely audible. "Do you really not want me anymore?"
###Chapter 163: Killing Daniel Again

Susan Thompson's name contained the word "sweet."

Those close to her called her Susu, but Vincent King stubbornly referred to her as "Candy."

In the dungeon's final days, Vincent had once told Daniel that this nickname was the only sweetness in his dark life.

Though young, Daniel remembered those words vividly. His Uncle Murphy would never give that name to just anyone!

"Uncle Murphy, she's a liar!" Daniel's eyes reddened with urgency. "Mom is your Candy!"

"Daniel, stop." Candy Wilson pretended to intervene, lowering her voice as she bent down. "Do you know why Vincent hates your mom? Because she's a slut, a whore who slept with anyone—"

"You're lying!" Daniel suddenly bit Candy's hand.

A scream pierced the parking lot.

By the time Vincent rushed out of the car, Candy had already slammed into a stone pillar. Blood seeped from the back of her head, staining her collar.

When Susan arrived, she saw Vincent cradling Candy tightly in his arms.

Daniel stared blankly at his hands. He had only bitten her—he hadn't pushed her at all.

"Candy, does it hurt?" Vincent's voice was uncharacteristically gentle.

"Murphy... I can't see..." Candy trembled as she reached out. "Why is it so dark?"

Vincent waved a hand in front of her eyes, but they remained unresponsive.

Susan shielded Daniel behind her. She knew better than anyone that her son, given his frail condition, couldn't possibly push an adult.

Candy had brought this on herself.

But would Vincent believe that?

"Susan." Vincent's gaze turned icy as he looked up. "So this is your 'resurrected' child?"

Every word dripped with venom. "Since he didn't die properly, I don't mind finishing the job."

Candy sobbed in his arms. "Murphy, don't blame Daniel... It's my fault..."

"You did nothing wrong." Vincent kissed her forehead. "Whoever hurt you will suffer worse than death."

"I have proof!" Daniel suddenly raised his phone. "I recorded everything she just said!"
###Chapter 164: Agony in Every Finger, Torment in Every Inch

Daniel's words hit Candy like a bucket of ice water, freezing her smug expression instantly.

The venomous words still echoed in her ears. A cold sweat broke out on Candy's back. If Vincent heard them, her carefully crafted image would be ruined.

"Murphy, I swear I never said those things!" Candy's eyes welled up, her voice trembling. "Why would this child lie about me?"

Daniel smirked and quickly unlocked his phone. "Uncle Murphy, listen to this. You'll understand."

As the screen lit up, Vincent suddenly kicked out.

Bang—

The phone went flying. At the same time, sharp pain shot through Daniel's wrist. He looked up into Vincent's icy gaze—like staring at a stranger.

"Mom!" Daniel lunged for the phone on the ground, but Vincent stepped on it first.

Susan rushed forward, her fingers barely grazing the edge of the phone before a polished black shoe crushed her hand.

The sickening sound of bones straining filled the air.

"Uncle Murphy!" Daniel pounded Vincent's leg. "You promised to protect Mom!"

Vincent looked down at Susan, his eyes swirling with unreadable emotions. He pressed down harder. Blood seeped between Susan's fingers.

"This lesson is what you deserve."

When Vincent finally lifted his foot, Susan's left hand was a mangled mess. The wound where her missing finger had been tore open again, staining her entire palm crimson.

"Let's go." Vincent scooped Candy into his arms and walked away. The taillights of the Lamborghini left a scarlet trail in the night.

"Mom..." Daniel's tears splashed onto Susan's injured hand. "This is all my fault..."

Susan gently stroked her son's face with her right hand. "No, Daniel. It's not your fault."

The night wind carried dust past them. A surveillance camera blinked red in the parking lot. Susan stared in the direction Vincent had gone, her heart splitting open.

"Mom, should we go see Grandpa Benjamin?" Daniel cradled her wounded hand carefully.

"No need." Susan forced a weak smile. "We have medicine at home."

A silver sports car screeched to a halt in front of them. The blinding headlights illuminated Susan's pale face. The door opened, and a pair of polished leather shoes stepped out of the shadows.
###Chapter 165: Gouge Out Daniel's Eyes!

Susan Thompson never expected to encounter Andrew Lucas in the underground parking lot.

The door of the sleek sports car swung open, revealing his long legs clad in sharply pressed suit pants. He towered over her with a gaze dark as ink.

"Susan?"

She ignored him, focusing on Daniel's shattered phone. The screen was beyond repair, its casing twisted.

"Answer me!" Andrew slammed the car door, but froze when he saw her bleeding hand. He seized her wrist. "What happened?"

"None of your business." She yanked her arm back.

Daniel bristled like an angry kitten. "Don't touch my mom!"

Andrew's icy glare made the boy shrink back.

"Hospital. Now." His grip was unyielding.

Susan raised her foot to kick him when she heard him order Leo Miller over the phone: "Pull the security footage."

She hesitated. This mall belonged to the Lucas Group - exactly where she needed evidence.

Reading her thoughts, Andrew snatched the broken phone and tossed it to Leo. "Have Ryan Lucas recover the data."

In the lounge, the monitor replayed the parking garage incident.

Candy Wilson's fake fall played in clear detail. Even Susan winced when the woman deliberately crashed into a pillar.

Andrew's knuckles turned white watching the footage. When Vincent King stomped on Susan's hand, he shattered a glass against the wall.

"Get the doctor." His voice could freeze hell.

Dr. Li fumbled through Susan's treatment under Andrew's murderous stare.

"Move." Andrew grabbed the ointment, applying it with clumsy gentleness.

The memory overlapped with reality - him bandaging her scraped knee years ago. For a heartbeat, she almost believed she saw tenderness in his eyes.

"Don't flatter yourself." He crushed her momentary weakness. "No one touches what's mine."

She lowered her gaze. "I know."

Susan and dogs - forbidden entry. That truth was carved into her bones.

After retrieving the restored recordings, she left with Daniel. Only to find Vincent blocking their path at the neighborhood gate.

"Gouge out that crippled brat's eyes!" Vincent's voice dripped venom.
###Chapter 166: Susan, Be My Woman!

"Vincent, you're insane!"

Susan shielded little Daniel tightly against her chest, her back pressed against the cold wall. The man who once seemed gentle as jade now resembled a raging lion.

"The surveillance footage proves Daniel's innocence!" Her trembling fingers pulled a flash drive from her bag. "Candy fell on her own!"

Vincent's lips curled into a cold smirk. His long fingers gripped her chin, his sharp features cutting through the moonlight.

"My eyes don't lie," his voice dropped dangerously. "This cripple pushed Candy."

"You're blind and heartless!" Susan winced in pain but lifted her chin defiantly. "Candy's a liar!"

Daniel suddenly lunged forward, small hands clutching Vincent's trousers. "Uncle Murphy..." His voice cracked with tears. "You promised to protect Mommy..."

Vincent shoved the child away violently. Daniel hit the floor with a sickening thud.

"Daniel!" Susan struggled to reach him, but Vincent pinned her down. A sharp pain shot through her abdomen as she clenched her teeth.

Vincent's men had already restrained Daniel, pressing a knife tip against the child's tear-stained face.

"Choose," Vincent whispered against her ear, his warm breath ghosting over her neck. "His eyes, or..."

His fingers traced her collarbone. "Be my woman."

Susan trembled violently. In the moonlight, Daniel's pale face glistened with tears as he gave her a reassuring smile.

"Mommy, don't be scared..." His faint whisper stabbed her heart like a blade.

Vincent's lips brushed her earlobe. "Please me."

The neighborhood stood eerily silent. A stray cat's cry echoed in the distance, resembling a baby's wail. Susan clenched her fists until her nails drew blood from her palms.

"I accept," she heard herself say.
###Chapter 167: Alexander Grant, Susan's Shame

Susan bit her lower lip until it bled, her nails digging deep into her palms.

Vincent's madness sent chills down her spine.

"Vincent, have you lost your mind?!" Her voice trembled. "Daniel is just a child! If you want to punish someone, follow the legal process!"

A cruel smile curled at Vincent's lips.

His slender fingers lifted Susan's chin, but his eyes remained icy.

"The law?" He scoffed. "Susan, you dare speak of the law?"

She slapped his hand away.

Vincent's gaze darkened instantly.

"I gave you a chance." His voice was venomous. "Since you refuse to cooperate..."

He turned and signaled to his bodyguard.

"Do it."

Susan's pupils constricted in horror.

She lunged toward Daniel, but Vincent yanked her back.

"Let me go!" She struggled desperately, her wrists reddening from the force.

Daniel stood quietly, unfazed.

His clear eyes met Vincent's gaze, his small face devoid of fear.

"Uncle Murphy," he said softly. "Mom says you're just sick."

Vincent's hand froze mid-air.

The bodyguard's blade was already raised.

A glint of cold steel flashed—

"Stop!"

A tall figure stepped between Daniel and the blade.

Alexander Grant twisted the bodyguard's wrist, sending the knife clattering to the ground.

Susan's legs gave way, nearly collapsing.

"Mr. Grant..." Her voice choked with tears.

Alexander glanced at her briefly before focusing on Daniel.

"You're safe now." He ruffled the boy's hair.

Daniel clung to Susan, wiping her tears with his small hands.

"Don't cry, Mom."

Susan buried her face in his shoulder, her body shaking.

Vincent's expression turned thunderous.

"Alexander, must you interfere?"

Alexander adjusted his cuffs leisurely.

"Bullying women and children isn't a good look, Vincent."

Vincent sneered.

"Do you even know what she is?" He pointed at Susan. "A gold-digging whore who slept her way up!"

Susan flinched violently.

Alexander's eyes turned glacial.

"Watch your mouth, Vincent." His tone was deceptively calm.

Vincent smirked mockingly.

"What? Has the great Alexander Grant taken a liking to used goods?"

Alexander moved faster than anyone expected.

His fist connected with Vincent's face, sending him staggering back, blood trickling from his lip.

"That's for your filthy tongue," Alexander said coldly.

Vincent wiped the blood away, his gaze venomous.

"You'd betray our years of friendship over some slut?"

Alexander unbuttoned his suit jacket, revealing a dangerous smile.

"Try me."

As tension crackled between them, Susan suddenly stepped forward.

"Enough!" Her red-rimmed eyes locked onto Vincent. "What will it take for you to leave Daniel alone?"

Vincent studied her for a long moment.

Then he laughed.

"You're disgusting, Susan."

He turned to leave, throwing one last threat over his shoulder.

"This isn't over."

Susan held Daniel tightly, trembling uncontrollably.

Alexander draped his jacket over her shoulders.

"Thank you," she whispered, barely audible.

He frowned at her pale face.

"Do you need help?"

She shook her head, clutching Daniel closer.

Her gaze fixed on where Vincent had disappeared, determination hardening in her eyes.

This time, she wouldn't back down.
###Chapter 168: Susan, You Have the Purest Soul in the World

Vincent's words cut through Susan's heart like a sharp blade.

She was crouching by the greenery, searching for the discarded USB drive when she heard him. Her fingers trembled violently.

Little Daniel tugged at her sleeve with concern.

Susan forced herself to stand, clutching the recovered USB tightly in her palm.

As she led her son toward Alexander Grant, she deliberately slowed her steps.

She'd heard the rumors about this business legend—his severe mysophobia and alleged allergy to women.

Under the streetlight, Alexander saw the pallor of Susan's face.

Her oversized wool coat only emphasized her fragile frame, as if a gust of wind could scatter her like dust.

Suddenly, Alexander stepped forward and grasped her ice-cold hand.

"Susan, you're not dirty." His voice was deep and firm. "I believe you have the purest soul in the world."

Susan looked up in shock, meeting his unwavering gaze.

After hearing those vile words, she never expected this man to defend her.

"Thank you," she whispered, her voice trembling as her eyes grew warm.

Remembering the laptop in Alexander's car, she quietly asked to borrow it.

With one glance from Alexander, his assistant Patrick immediately retrieved the computer.

Only then did Susan realize her hand was still being held. She tried to pull away in embarrassment.

But Alexander instinctively tightened his grip before catching himself and releasing her, the tips of his ears turning suspiciously red.

To Vincent, this scene was like salt in a wound.

"Susan!" he spat through clenched teeth. "What game are you playing now?"

"I just want to prove Daniel's innocence." Susan opened the video file and turned the screen toward Vincent. "If he's innocent, you owe him an apology."

The footage clearly showed Candy leaning down to whisper in Daniel's ear before dramatically throwing herself against a stone pillar.

Vincent's pupils constricted violently.

He never imagined the "truth" he'd witnessed could be so ugly.

Susan played another recording.

Candy's venomous voice echoed through the night air: "...Susan is vile, shameless..."

Vincent looked as if he'd been struck by lightning.

The kind, gentle Candy he remembered now stood revealed in her true colors.

"Vincent." Susan's voice was cold as ice. "Apologize to Daniel."

The night wind carried a dried leaf between them.

Vincent remained motionless, frozen like a statue.
###Chapter 169: Susan's Retribution

"Susan Thompson!"

Vincent King jerked his head up, crimson eyes burning with terrifying rage. His gaze could shred a person apart—whether from fury, hatred, or regret, it was impossible to tell.

Susan remained unfazed by his murderous expression. Her voice was ice-cold. "Vincent, apologize to Daniel."

A proud man like Vincent would never bow to a lame child.

But when his eyes landed on Susan's heavily bandaged left hand, his imposing aura faltered. The thick gauze was soaked with blood, barely concealing the missing pinky finger. The gruesome wound stabbed into his heart like a blade.

He had done this to her.

"Mr. King, apologize." Alexander Grant's voice cut through the air, his eyes glinting with frost. He'd never seen someone so blind, manipulated by a woman like a puppet.

Vincent's chest heaved. Guilt surged, only to be swallowed by raging fury when he saw Susan standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Alexander.

"Apologize to this cripple?" Vincent sneered. "In your dreams."

"Candy did nothing wrong. You brought this on yourselves."

"True," Susan said, her lips curling in mockery. "But if you refuse, this video will trend tomorrow. Candy cares about her image. Do you think she'll thank you?"

Vincent's pupils constricted. He lunged for the USB drive.

Susan stepped back calmly. "Go ahead and destroy it. I have backups."

His face darkened. He might not care about Susan, but he couldn't risk Candy's reputation.

"Daniel..." The words scraped out of his throat. "I wronged you this time."

The apology reeked of condescension, but it was enough for the boy.

Tears welled in Daniel's eyes as he tugged gently at Susan's sleeve. "Mom, let's go home."

He wished Uncle Murphy would hug him like before. But the man before him was no longer the one he remembered.

"Mr. Grant, thank you." Susan handed the laptop back to Patrick Pope. "Your coat is still at my place. I'll—"

"Don't bother." Alexander cut her off. "I'll retrieve it myself."

As mother and son disappeared into the neighborhood, Daniel suddenly turned back.

"You're not Uncle Murphy." His voice trembled. "My Uncle Murphy was kind. He's just... lost."

"Goodbye, Mr. King."

Vincent stood frozen, his heart carved hollow. He didn't care about this child—so why did it feel like the world had abandoned him?

Alexander slid into his car and dialed Benjamin Nash.

"Grandfather, cancel tomorrow's blind date."

"What?" Benjamin roared. "The reservation's made! If you don't show, consider me dead to you!"

The call ended with a slam.

Alexander's eyes darkened like ink. He despised scheming women—and this one had dared to target his grandfather.

Patrick read his expression. "Boss, that woman has no sense."

"Prepare a gift." Alexander's lips curved dangerously. "One she'll remember for life."
###Chapter 170: Susan, Let's Spend Our Lifetime Together

Patrick Pope held his breath as Alexander Grant finished speaking.

His boss was known for his ruthless efficiency. This time, he meant business.

Patrick shook his head inwardly. That gold-digging woman deserved what was coming.

Though he hadn't investigated thoroughly, he'd heard she came from humble origins and had a child.

A single mother catching old Mr. Nash's eye? She must have used underhanded tactics.

Disgust twisted Patrick's features as he changed the subject.

"Boss, we've got Susan Thompson's file."

Alexander's expression remained impassive. A silent command to continue.

"She's twenty-two. Previously... married."

Patrick watched for any reaction.

To his surprise, not even a flicker of emotion crossed Alexander's face.

"Go on."

Patrick swallowed hard. "Her ex-husband was Andrew Lucas. Their divorce was finalized last month—on his wedding day."

Alexander finally looked up.

"Andrew Lucas?"

Patrick nodded vigorously. "Yes! And there's more..."

He hesitated before lowering his voice. "That mysterious woman from South Lake's rumors... The one Andrew buried with full widow's rites..."

"...was Susan."

Alexander's long fingers tapped the armrest.

Patrick ventured cautiously, "Boss, her past is complicated. You have... standards."

"I don't mind."

Patrick nearly bit his tongue. "You'd... become a stepfather?"

"Why not."

The car plunged into terrifying silence.

Patrick's grip on the steering wheel trembled.

Just as he thought the conversation was over, Alexander spoke again.

"She's worth it."

Three simple words that struck Patrick like lightning.

"Missing her past is my regret."

"But her future? I'll be there for all of it."

The car swerved as Patrick jerked in shock.

Catching his boss's eternal ice-king expression in the rearview mirror, realization dawned—

This was serious.

Meanwhile, in a hospital room.

The door creaked open. Candy Wilson "weakly" fluttered her eyelids.

"Vincent... Will I never see again?"

She covered her face with trembling hands, peeking through her fingers at Vincent King's reaction.

"The doctors say it's temporary."

Candy "brightened," clutching the sheets. "Really? That's wonderful!"

Then her face fell again. "But the garage incident..."

"I know I've made mistakes, I've been trying to atone. I never thought Susan would teach her child to do this..."

She studied Vincent's expression as she spoke.

"Vincent, you went to see them, didn't you? Please don't hurt them..."

Vincent cut her off. "Had enough acting?"

Candy froze.

"I met Susan."

"Almost gouged that child's eye out."

Joy surged through Candy, though she forced tears to her eyes. "He's just a child, please spare him..."

"Pity."

Vincent leaned down, locking eyes with her.

"I found out the truth."
###Chapter 171: Truth and Blind Date

Candy's fingers clenched the bedsheet tightly, her nails nearly digging into her palms. "Vincent, what are you talking about? What truth?"

She forced a wounded expression. "Wasn't it Susan who incited that child to hurt me?"

Vincent's gaze turned sharp. "Candy, did that child really push you?"

Her heart skipped a beat. She never thought she'd done anything wrong, but his icy stare sent an inexplicable chill down her spine.

"Of course! If he hadn't pushed me, why would I have fallen?" She bit her lip. "But Vincent, don't blame him. He's just a child..."

Vincent suddenly let out a cold laugh, repeating the recording word for word: "Daniel, Vincent hates you, and he hates your mother Susan even more..."

Candy's face turned deathly pale.

She opened her mouth to defend herself, but Vincent continued, "The surveillance footage shows you fell on your own."

Her entire body trembled. She never expected there would be cameras in such a secluded spot.

"That's not true!" She frantically grabbed his sleeve. "My high heel twisted, and I thought—"

Vincent's expression grew colder. If she had just admitted it, he might have respected her more. But now, her pathetic lies only disgusted him.

All these years, he thought Susan was the despicable one. Yet the person who truly repulsed him was the woman he'd loved for so long—his fiancée.

"Candy," he said wearily, "as my wife, you'll want for nothing materially. But beyond that, I can give you nothing."

She clung to his sleeve, but the next second, he mercilessly shook her off.

"Vincent!"

In her panic, she tumbled off the hospital bed, her forehead slamming hard against the nightstand. But the man who once cherished her didn't even glance back.

Amid the searing pain, Candy's face twisted into something terrifying.

Susan, do you really think you've won?

Dream on!

Susan was meeting someone Benjamin had introduced to her tonight.

When she dropped Daniel off at Benjamin's place, the old man was enthusiastically preparing lesson plans. Ever since discovering Daniel's medical talent, Benjamin couldn't wait to teach him everything he knew.

"Susan, don't worry," Benjamin reassured her with a pat on the shoulder. "Daniel is safe with me."

She nodded. Earlier, the kindergarten teacher had repeatedly apologized, saying she hadn't noticed Daniel being bullied by other children. Susan didn't make a fuss, only reminding the teacher to pay closer attention in the future.

She wasn't taking this blind date seriously, so she wore only a simple white dress and a beige coat. Yet even so, she drew plenty of gazes when she stood at the restaurant entrance.

The private room at Elegant Joy was tastefully decorated, its sandalwood furniture exuding a faint fragrance. Susan waited for half an hour, but her date still hadn't arrived.

Just as she was about to call to ask, the door suddenly swung open.

Standing there was none other than Kevin Oak—the man who had framed her!
###Chapter 172: Scum!

Susan's nails dug deep into her palms.

She stared at the greasy face before her, stomach churning.

"Grandpa Nash's grandson?" Her lips curled in a cold smile. "Kevin Oak, you're not worthy."

The click of the locked private room door sounded like a knife plunging into her heart.

Kevin rubbed his hands together as he advanced. "Susan, don't be so distant. After tonight, we'll be family."

Susan shot to her feet, only to be hit by sudden dizziness.

Gripping the table edge, she realized the water tasted wrong.

"You drugged me?" Her voice trembled.

Kevin grinned, revealing yellowed teeth. "Just to set the mood. Miss Capra specifically requested we... enjoy ourselves thoroughly."

That name sent ice through Susan's veins.

Her hand moved toward her pocket, but Kevin slammed his palm over hers.

"Not so fast." He pulled out his phone and expertly propped it on the table. "Let's show our audience how enthusiastic Miss Thompson can be."

As the livestream interface lit up, Susan grabbed the teacup and hurled it.

"Crash!"

The phone screen shattered instantly.

Kevin's face twisted. "Bitch!"

He lunged, choking her with hands that reeked of stale cigarettes. "You refused the easy way!"

Susan clawed at his face, drawing blood.

The drug's effects intensified, blurring her vision.

"Help..." The word died in her throat, too faint even for her own ears.

Kevin tore at her collar with a sneer. "Scream! This room's soundproof!"

When her back hit the cold marble table, Susan bit her tongue hard.

The metallic taste brought momentary clarity.

She drove her knee upward with all her strength.

"Agh!"

Kevin collapsed, clutching himself.

Staggering toward the door, Susan's fingers barely grazed the handle before her hair was yanked violently backward.

"Running?" Kevin smashed her head against the wall. "Where to?"

White pain exploded behind her eyes.

Sliding down the wall, she felt warm liquid trickling from her temple.

"How much did Nicole Capra pay you?" she rasped.

Panting, Kevin pulled out another phone. "Enough to buy your worthless life!"

The new livestream already showed scrolling comments:

[Who's the chick?]
[Is this for real?]
[Hot!]

Watching the viewer count climb, Susan suddenly laughed.

She pushed herself up, smoothing blood-streaked hair with trembling fingers.

"Kevin Oak." Her voice was eerily calm. "Do you know what happened to the last man who touched me?"

Kevin paused, then guffawed. "What? Did he end up in your bed?"

"The morgue."

With that, Susan grabbed a wine bottle and smashed it against the fire alarm.

The piercing shriek filled the entire floor.

Kevin's face drained of color. "You crazy—"

Footsteps pounded outside.

Before darkness took her, Susan spoke clearly into the camera: "Nicole Capra, you're next."
###Chapter 173: Andrew Lucas Threatens to Break Susan's Leg

"Get away!"

Susan's vision blurred as a ringing filled her ears. She bit down hard on her lower lip, the metallic taste of blood spreading in her mouth, but it did nothing to quell the scorching heat surging through her body.

Kevin Oak's greasy face loomed too close.

His cologne mixed with sweat made her nauseous. Yet her body betrayed her, craving proximity to that repulsive figure against her will.

"Don't play hard to get, Susan." Kevin grinned, bits of food stuck between his yellowed teeth. "The live audience is waiting."

The shattering of a glass briefly cleared her mind.

She grabbed a shard and slashed her arm. Blood trailed down her pale skin, the pain granting her a fleeting moment of clarity.

"You bitch!" Kevin's face twisted as he slapped her.

Darkness edged her vision, but she mustered the strength to smash a teapot against his forehead.

"Who are you pretending to be?" Wiping his face, Kevin lunged at her with a leer. "Soon you'll be begging me—"

The door exploded off its hinges.

Andrew Lucas stood in the doorway, fury radiating from him. His gaze swept over Susan's disheveled collar and bloodied arm before freezing into ice.

"M-Mr. Lucas..." Kevin fumbled to shut off the livestream, forcing an obsequious smile. "Susan and I were just—"

A fist crushed his face before he could finish.

Two front teeth flew out with a spray of blood. Before Kevin could react, a kick to his gut sent his obese body slamming into the wall.

"Mercy, Mr. Lucas!" He wailed on his knees. "She came onto me—"

Andrew stepped down hard between his legs.

The scream cut off abruptly.

The black Maybach raced through the stormy night.

In the backseat, Susan clawed at her collar, her snow-white skin flushed an unnatural red. Unconsciously, she pressed against Andrew, her scorching breath grazing his neck.

"Hot..."

Andrew gripped her chin, his voice a blade. "Who allowed you to meet trash like that?"

Her unfocused eyes struggled to meet his. Staring at the face she'd longed for day and night, she suddenly smiled.

"Andrew..." She shook her head weakly. "I don't love you anymore."

The words detonated his restraint. He pinned her against the leather seat, teeth sinking into her earlobe. "Say that again."

Trembling from the pain, she repeated stubbornly, "I don't... love—"

A ruthless kiss swallowed the lie.

Andrew yanked off his tie to bind her wrists, storms raging in his eyes. "Susan, you'll never escape me."

By the time the car stopped at the villa, Susan had lost all coherence. Clinging to Andrew like a drowning woman to driftwood, she dug her fingers into his shoulders.

"Help me..."

He carried her inside and kicked open the bedroom door. Moonlight through the sheer curtains illuminated her tear-streaked face.

"Remember this," he whispered against her ear. "If you dare touch another man, I'll break your legs."
###Chapter 174: Susan, You're Not Allowed to Stop Loving Me!

Susan's vision blurred.

She couldn't recognize the figure before her, only feeling a pair of scorching hands gripping her shoulders tightly.

"Who do you love?" A hoarse voice exploded in her ear.

She shook her head blankly.

The only person she remembered loving was her Andrew.

But that same Andrew had destroyed everything.

"Andrew... I don't love you anymore..." She repeated the words unconsciously.

Andrew Lucas's pupils constricted violently.

He clearly saw the unfocused light in her eyes, knowing she wasn't in her right mind.

Yet those words still ignited a fire in his chest.

"Susan!" He slammed her against the wall. "Say that again!"

The impact hurt, but she continued mechanically, "I don't love you anymore..."

Crimson rage flooded Andrew's eyes.

He yanked open her collar and bit down savagely on her collarbone.

"You don't get to choose!"

Alexander Grant's Maybach sped through the night.

Patrick Pope clutched his seatbelt nervously. "Boss, Kevin Oak messaged that it's done—"

"Shut up!"

Alexander floored the accelerator.

His knuckles turned white on the steering wheel, Benjamin Nash's panicked mention of "Susan" ringing in his ears.

That bastard Kevin actually dared...

The steering wheel groaned under his grip.

The private room's door exploded inward.

Alexander stood frozen in the doorway, scanning the empty space.

The pool of blood on the floor stopped his breath.

"Pull the security footage." His voice could freeze hell. "Now."

Before Patrick could react, Alexander was already sprinting toward the elevator.

His hands trembled as he dialed his phone.

If anything happened to Susan...

He'd never forgive himself.
###Chapter 175: Through Fire and Water, Without Regret

Alexander Grant's breath caught at the scene inside the private room.

Broken liquor bottles littered the floor, their jagged edges reflecting harsh light.

"Kevin Oak's methods remain as vile as ever," Patrick Pope muttered, shaking his head. "Boss, that woman must have suffered terribly—"

His words died abruptly.

The crimson fury in Alexander's eyes made his blood run cold.

Those usually impassive eyes now churned with a storm of emotions.

"Boss?" Patrick's voice tightened. "You—"

"It's Susan."

Alexander's voice was raw with anguish.

Patrick's pupils contracted sharply.

Miss Thompson?!

No wonder the boss was—

He wisely retreated, returning moments later with an update: "Andrew Lucas took her away. The staff said... Miss Thompson was... bleeding."

Drip.

Drip.

Alexander could almost hear the sound of blood hitting the floor.

Each drop pierced his heart.

He'd arrived too late.

Someone else had saved her.

It felt like his heart had been carved out—only to be crushed before his eyes.

Yet he couldn't let go.

Not in this lifetime.

Even if she hated him to the bone, he would spend the rest of his days atoning.

Through fire and water—nothing would stop him.

Morning light stung Susan's eyes.

Memories flooded back.

Andrew's scent.

Torn clothing.

Humiliating entanglement.

She mechanically dressed, her coat concealing bruises.

The icy wind couldn't numb the disgust in her heart.

Her phone vibrated.

Benjamin Nash's cheerful voice chirped: "Susan, what do you think of my boy Alex?"

"Alexander Grant?" Her fingers trembled.

"He didn't introduce himself?" Benjamin chuckled. "He's quite taken with you!"

Taken enough... to send Kevin Oak to humiliate her?

Susan's lips twisted. "He's great."

Great at showing her reality.

Hanging up, she stared at the leaden sky.

The King's Glory endorsement...

Forget it.

As long as Daniel was safe.

At her apartment, Alexander's figure suddenly filled her vision.

He stood like a silent statue.
###Chapter 176: Every Scar She Bears Was Caused By Him

Alexander Grant still wore yesterday's suit, his bloodshot eyes betraying a sleepless night.

Susan Thompson recalled his words about her possessing the purest soul in the world, then remembered how he'd sent Kevin Oak to humiliate her last night. Her eyes reddened instantly.

She took half a step back, forcing composure. "Mr. Grant, are you here for your coat?"

Alexander remained silent, his burning gaze fixed on her pallid face.

Fate was cruel. Some women couldn't stir his heart after years of acquaintance, yet Susan had left the deepest mark after one meeting.

Unforgettable.

And he refused to forget.

The cold wind painted her porcelain skin with faint pink, making her appear fragile as glass.

His eyes dropped to the horrifying bruises around her neck, his brows furrowing violently.

When he noticed the vicious wound on her right hand, his breath hitched.

But what shocked him most was her bandaged left hand—missing a finger.

"Excuse me." Susan avoided his gaze, her voice barely audible. "I need to open the door for your coat."

Keys jingled faintly in her trembling hands. Each step sent searing pain through her swollen ankle.

Vincent King's shove last night had caused the sprain, and this morning's long walk worsened it. Yet she kept her spine straight, refusing to show weakness before this man.

The simple act of unlocking the door became an ordeal.

"Your coat is on the sofa." She wiped her right hand carefully with a tissue before lifting the suit jacket.

Alexander took it as if waking from a dream, his Adam's apple bobbing.

"Please leave." Her tone was flat. "I need to shower."

Those telltale marks on her neck stabbed his eyes. He suddenly understood—she wanted to wash away last night's humiliation.

And it all stemmed from his decision.

"Susan—"

"Don't worry, I won't tell Mr. Nash about last night." Her lips curved bitterly. "As I said, you did nothing wrong."

"That's not—"

"Really, it wasn't necessary." She interrupted softly. "I know I'm beneath your notice, but believe me, I never aimed above my station."

"We won't meet again." Leaning against the wall, she moved toward the door, each step like walking on knives. "The door's open. Please go."

Suddenly, Alexander stepped forward and pulled her into a crushing embrace.
###Chapter 177: Alexander's Heartache for Susan

Susan's pupils constricted sharply.

Alexander Grant's actions left her utterly bewildered.

First, he offered trust that warmed her heart, only to send Kevin Oak to humiliate her moments later. Now this inexplicable embrace made her question whether the man had severe mental issues.

She didn't discriminate against those with mental illness, but the terrifying memories of Greenhill Mental Hospital still haunted her.

The shadows of that night refused to fade.

Had Andrew Lucas not arrived in time, her life might have been ruined by Kevin Oak. Those drugs had stripped her of all reason—staying in that livestream room any longer would have been disastrous.

And the mastermind behind it all was this capricious man standing before her.

"Mr. Grant, please behave yourself!"

Susan pushed him away in a panic, bending to pick up the fallen coat and shoving it back into his arms. "You must be swamped with work. You should leave."

Alexander narrowed his eyes.

The way she looked at him was off—that wariness and guardedness, as if sizing up some dangerous creature.

The feeling of being rejected made his chest tighten.

But when his gaze landed on the wounds on her hands, all his displeasure dissolved into guilt.

"Susan, I didn't know it was you last night."

For the first time in his life, the proud Alexander Grant lowered his head to explain. "I never meant to hurt you."

"Had I known it was you, I wouldn't have let Kevin Oak come anywhere near you."

He paused, then continued, "Women have often schemed to get close to me, even resorting to drugging me. When my grandfather called, I thought you were one of them."

Susan froze.

The cold and ruthless heir of the Grant empire was actually apologizing to her?

But that didn't change the facts.

"Mr. Grant, when you sent Kevin Oak, you should have considered the consequences." Her voice trembled. "Some wounds can't be healed with an apology."

"I need to freshen up. Please leave."

She pulled open the door, but the man didn't budge.

Susan turned to walk away when her wrist was suddenly seized.

"You're hurt."

Alexander's voice carried an unprecedented tenderness. Without waiting for a response, he pressed her onto the sofa. "Let me handle this."

A single phone call later, Patrick Pope arrived within ten minutes with a full medical kit.

Alexander gently cleaned the wound on her right hand. Though Andrew had already treated it, the gruesome scar was still horrifying to behold.

Patrick stood by, dumbfounded.

Was this man, so careful as he applied ointment, really his decisive and ruthless young master?

When it came to her left hand, the blood-soaked bandage had fused with her flesh. Susan clenched her teeth, her face as pale as paper.

Alexander's heart clenched.

How much pain was she in?

When he peeled back the bandage to reveal the mangled stump where her pinky finger had been, his eyes burned.

"Your finger..." His voice was hoarse. "How did you lose it?"
###Chapter 178: He Would Bow Before Susan Thompson

Alexander Grant froze when his fingertips brushed against the scar on the inner side of her wrist.

The jagged mark snaked across her delicate skin like an ugly centipede.

He couldn't imagine what depths of despair this stubborn woman had endured.

"Did it hurt?" His voice was rough.

Susan withdrew her hand, tugging her sleeve down. "Not anymore."

Her tone was casual, as if discussing someone else's life.

Alexander's heart twisted as if pierced by needles.

How he wished he'd met her sooner—to be her light during her darkest days.

"Give me your other hand." He grasped her right wrist without waiting for permission.

Susan instinctively tried to pull away, but his grip was firm.

"Stay still." He carefully unwrapped the bandage and reapplied the ointment.

Patrick Pope stood nearby, eyes nearly bulging from their sockets.

Since when did the ruthless head of the Grant family act like this?

"Thank you." Susan's polite gratitude carried unmistakable distance.

Alexander remained silent, his gaze dropping to her exposed ankle.

The swelling was severe.

"You sprained it." His brow furrowed.

"It's fine, I can—"

Before she could finish, he cradled her foot in his hands.

"Don't move." He poured medicinal oil into his palm and pressed it against her skin.

Susan sucked in a sharp breath.

"Bear with it." His fingers worked with precise pressure. "The bruising needs to disperse."

Patrick covered his eyes.

This was it. The boss was completely gone.

The mighty Alexander Grant—massaging a woman's foot!

Susan bit her lip, a sheen of sweat forming at her temples.

"Yell if it hurts." Alexander lightened his touch.

"It doesn't." Her voice was stubborn.

Watching her endure the pain silently, his chest constricted as if squeezed by an invisible hand.

This obstinate woman wouldn't even admit to pain.

"Done." He applied a medicated patch. "No walking for two days."

Susan withdrew her foot, flexing it awkwardly.

The pain had indeed lessened.

"Mr. Grant, about yesterday—"

"Consider it forgotten." He cut her off. "Don't dwell on it."

Susan exhaled in relief.

"Regarding the endorsement—"

"Patrick will contact you this afternoon." He stood. "Rest well."

At the doorway, he suddenly turned back.

"Susan."

"Yes?"

"You'll become the brightest star."

His certainty made it sound like an indisputable fact.

Susan blinked, stunned.

By the time she regained her composure, the man was gone.

Patrick hurried after him. "Boss, the endorsement fee—"

"Highest tier."

"But her current market value—"

"I said highest tier."

Patrick shut his mouth.

Right. Spoiling her rotten, then.

Andrew Lucas's car idled at the curb.

His icy gaze tracked Alexander's departure from the residential complex.

That man had just come from Susan's apartment.

His knuckles whitened around the steering wheel.
###Chapter 179: Her Corrupted Heart

What a despicable woman!

Andrew Lucas glared at the closed door, his knuckles turning white.

She had just left his bed and was already seducing another man.

He slammed the car door shut, still clutching the carefully prepared meal.

He had almost thrown it away, but some inexplicable impulse made him bring it upstairs.

Susan Thompson was about to take a shower when the doorbell rang.

Through the peephole, she saw Andrew's dark expression.

"Psycho," she muttered, turning away.

Her phone rang sharply. The moment she answered, Andrew's furious voice exploded through the receiver.

"Open the door!"

"Andrew, what the hell is wrong with you?"

"Not opening?" He sneered. "Then say goodbye to this door!"

Susan trembled with anger but knew he meant it.

Dragging her injured leg, she yanked the door open. "I'll pay you back. Now get lost!"

Andrew's eyes burned red as he stared at her.

He had cooked for her this morning—something even his own mother never received.

And her? She immediately ran to Alexander Grant.

"You jump from my bed to Alexander's? How shameless can you be?" He shoved her against the wall.

"Was last night not enough for you?"

"You're insane!" Susan shook violently.

"Who I love is none of your business! I'd rather love a dog than you!"

"Say that again." Rage flickered in his eyes.

"I said you're worse than a dog!" She lifted her chin.

"Susan Thompson stopped loving you long ago!"

"Don't love me?" He gripped her jaw.

"Then you'll never love anyone else!"

He crushed his lips against hers, tasting blood.

Susan stood motionless like a corpse until he finally released her.

She immediately grabbed a wipe, scrubbing her mouth furiously.

"Disgusting."

Andrew's gaze landed on Alexander's jacket on the couch. His pupils constricted.

Clothes off already? So they really...

"Enjoying being a whore?" He ripped open her collar.

"Sleeping with Alexander for an endorsement? You're filthy!"

Susan suddenly laughed.

"Yes, I'm filthy." She pointed at her chest.

"This place? It's already rotten."

Her smile cut him like a knife.

He hurled the meal box to the ground, soup splattering everywhere.

"Susan, you'll always be mine." He choked her throat.

"Even if you rot, it'll be in my hands."
###Chapter 180: How Virtuous of You, Susan!

Susan's fingernails dug deep into her palms.

She thought she had grown strong enough, but his cruel words still made her heart tremble as if being sliced by a blunt knife.

"Mr. Lucas sure enjoys meddling." She tilted her chin up with a dazzling smile. "What? Want to take a number too?"

"Susan!"

Andrew slammed her against the wall, his knuckles turning white. "Are you this desperate? Willing to climb into Alexander Grant's bed just for an endorsement deal?"

"I pale in comparison to you, Mr. Lucas." She laughed lightly, brushing off his hand. "After all, you're the one who couldn't even spare your own sister."

Andrew's eyes darkened instantly.

A low chuckle escaped his lips, venomous as a poisoned blade scraping against her nerves.

"Playing the chaste virgin?" He leisurely pulled out his wallet and threw banknotes at her face. "This should cover your nightly rate."

The sharp edges of the bills left stinging trails on her cheeks.

Susan bit her lower lip until it bled.

Her peripheral vision caught the vase on the coffee table. The urge to smash it over his head nearly overwhelmed her.

But as her fingers touched the cold porcelain, they went limp.

The vase shattered on the floor.

"Having second thoughts?" Andrew gripped her chin. "Saving your purity for Alexander Grant? Do you even deserve him?"

He leaned in, his breath scalding. "You took the money. Now serve your client properly."

Susan trembled violently.

Pain shot through her ankle. Her eyes burned, but she turned away, refusing to let him see her vulnerability.

The movement enraged Andrew.

"Look at me!" He forcibly turned her face, only to freeze when he saw fresh blood seeping through the bandage on her hand.

Last night's wound had reopened.

Andrew's chest heaved violently.

Cursing viciously, he instinctively reached for the first aid kit. As he turned, he spotted the medical bag by the couch—its bandages already unwrapped. Susan's left hand bore fresh dressing.

Alexander had been here.

The realization brought both relief and fury. Relief that she hadn't slept with anyone, fury that another man had touched her.

"Don't move!" he barked when she tried to stand.

Susan sneered. "Want another round, Mr. Lucas?"

"I said don't move!" He rummaged for ointment but halted at her defensive glare.

During their standoff, Susan twisted her injured ankle and collapsed heavily onto the floor.

Andrew lunged forward but stopped short at her rejecting stare.

"Get out." She pulled herself up using the wall, voice hoarse. "I'll return your money. Now disappear."

Dismissed again.

Veins bulged at Andrew's temples. His gaze locked onto her bloodless lips before he finally kicked over the coffee table and stormed out, slamming the door behind him.
###Chapter 181: Andrew Cooks for Susan

"Susan!"

Andrew's pupils constricted as he watched Susan collapse limply.

He lunged forward, catching her in his arms, only then noticing her swollen ankle—puffy as a steamed bun.

Her lips were pressed into a bloodless line, but tears still welled uncontrollably in her eyes.

Andrew's chest tightened. He kept reminding himself—this woman was vicious, selfish, utterly undeserving of sympathy.

Yet the sight of those angry wounds on her hands made his resolve waver.

"Mr. Lucas, let me go!" Susan struggled to stand.

Last night's humiliation burned through her. She refused to show even a shred of weakness before him again.

"Shut up!"

He shoved her back onto the couch with rough hands, then turned to fetch the first-aid kit.

His movements were brusque as he grabbed her wrist, but the moment his fingers brushed the injuries, his touch inexplicably gentled.

"I can do it myself!"

"Your hand's nearly useless. Stop being stubborn." Andrew sneered, yet his ministrations grew even more careful.

Silence settled heavily after he finished tending her wounds. Just as Susan prepared to demand he leave, his voice cut through the quiet:

"You haven't eaten breakfast."

She blinked, confused by his sudden concern.

"I'm not hungry." She turned her face away. "Please go."

Her stomach chose that moment to emit a loud, traitorous growl.

The corner of Andrew's mouth twitched almost imperceptibly. He retrieved an ornate food container.

When he laid out four dishes and a soup—sweet and sour fish, stir-fried bamboo shoots, cola chicken wings—Susan's breath hitched.

Every one of her former favorites.

Memories surged like a tidal wave. How she used to complain of hunger, how he'd secretly learned to cook. That first disastrous attempt nearly burned down the kitchen, yet he'd eventually surpassed restaurant chefs.

"Eat."

He placed a perfectly deboned piece of fish in her bowl. Soon, a small mountain of food towered before her.

Susan stared at the fish, her face draining of color.

The dungeon. Being force-fed raw fish. The stench of rot still clinging to her tongue.

When a chicken wing landed in her bowl, she couldn't hold back anymore—lurching toward the trash can to retch violently.

"Susan!" Andrew's face darkened with fury.

He'd lowered himself to cook for her, and this was her response?

What he didn't know: these once-beloved flavors had long become her worst nightmares.
###Chapter 182: Susan Thompson, The Stain That Won't Wash Off

Andrew Lucas's pupils constricted violently.

His gaze locked onto the streak of blood at the corner of Susan's pale lips, his heart gripped by an invisible fist.

"Susan!" He shot up from his chair, the legs scraping against the floor with a piercing screech.

Susan clutched her stomach, too weak to speak. She mechanically wiped her mouth, her eyes terrifyingly hollow.

Andrew seized her wrist. "What the hell is wrong with you?!"

"Let go." Her voice was feather-light. "Just a stomachache."

His knuckles turned white. Memories of her mentioning stomach cancer—and all her supposed "lies"—churned in his chest, a storm of unnameable emotions.

"Eat." The command was brittle as he shoved a bowl of sweet corn porridge toward her.

Susan stared at the mush and suddenly laughed. How ironic—the man she once loved most now didn't even believe she was sick.

She forced down each spoonful, swallowing shards of glass.

Andrew watched her obedient movements, his expression softening despite himself. He even took an uncharacteristic sip of the sickly-sweet porridge—disgusting, yet watching her eat it made it almost tolerable.

By the time afternoon light sliced through the curtains, Andrew was gone.

Susan stood under the shower, water sluicing over her skin, but no amount of scrubbing could erase the filth embedded in her bones.

Patrick Pope's call came at the perfect moment.

"Contract's signed. Ten million for the endorsement." His tone was strictly professional. "Mr. Grant's personal request."

Susan's fingers trembled over the string of zeros on the contract. Enough to pay off a fraction of her debts.

She texted Andrew: [Send me your account number.]

An immediate reply: [?]

[Paying you back.]

Her phone buzzed—Andrew was calling. "Susan, where'd you get that kind of money?"

"Endorsement fee. For King's Glory."

Silence. Then a cold laugh. "Alexander Grant's money? How generous."

The line went dead before she could respond.

Susan stared at the darkened screen, lips twisting. Counting the digits in her account balance, she felt something unfamiliar—hope.

The private detective called at dusk.

"Ms. Thompson, target's at Golden Splendor." A hushed voice. "Room 308."

From the depths of a drawer, Susan retrieved a pinhole camera, her smile sharp as ice.

Nicole Capra, your turn.
###Chapter 183: Relentless Pursuit, Heart Turned Dark

Susan Thompson had always disdained prying into others' privacy.

But the despicable pair, Nicole Capra and Henry Bartley, were utterly revolting.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she stared at the photos sent by the private detective.

In the images, Nicole clung to Henry's arm, entering the Golden Splendor club with a coquettish smile.

Susan smirked coldly.

This was Andrew Lucas's cherished "first love"?

Playing the innocent maiden while juggling multiple men—Nicole must have nerves of steel to avoid splitting her personality.

Golden Splendor, owned by the King family, had tight security.

Susan applied flawless makeup, her winged eyeliner sharp and lips blazing red.

The guards at the entrance froze at the sight of her, mistaking the radiant beauty for a celebrity.

They didn’t even check her bag.

The door to the VIP suite on the top floor was slightly ajar.

She slipped in silently and quickly placed the disguised pinhole cameras—a lighter and a button—on the bedside and windowsill.

Perfect angles.

As she turned to leave, the door suddenly swung open.

Vincent King's towering figure blocked the exit, his gaze dark and dangerous.

"What are you doing here?" His grip on her wrist was bruising.

Her heart skipped a beat.

"Let go!"

She struggled fiercely, but footsteps echoed down the hallway.

Henry's greasy voice grew closer. "Nicole, I've missed you so much..."

Susan paled.

Too late.

She yanked Vincent into the bathroom and locked the door.

In the cramped space, their breaths tangled.

He pinned her against the wall, eyes unreadable. "Here to spy?"

Her pupils constricted.

"Let me guess..." He leaned in, his warm breath brushing her neck. "Trying to ruin Nicole? Or..."

"Trying to crawl back to Andrew?"

The sound of rustling clothes came from outside.

Susan stiffened.

Vincent suddenly smiled—a chilling sight.

"What if I throw you out right now?"

His long fingers traced her cheek, but his gaze remained icy.

She bit her lip hard.

Her plan had unraveled completely.

Staring at his dangerously handsome face, a realization struck her—

Tonight, she might not leave this room alive.
###Chapter 184: Mad for Her, Never Letting Go

"Vincent!" Susan Thompson spat out the name through clenched teeth, her entire body trembling.

She wished she could shove this man down the drain and wash him away, so he'd stop wreaking havoc with that handsome face of his.

"Scared?" Vincent King's lips curled into a wicked smirk, his dark eyes swirling with madness.

"I wonder what expressions Nicole Capra and Henry Bartley will have when they see you."

Susan bit down hard, swallowing the curses on the tip of her tongue. She couldn't alert the despicable pair outside.

Nicole and Henry had barely stepped through the door before tumbling onto the bed, wasting no time with words.

The bathroom door wasn't fully closed. Through the crack, Susan had a clear view of the obscene scene unfolding outside.

The lewd sounds burned her ears. Though she wasn't some naive girl, witnessing such intimacy up close was a first.

Vincent's gaze darkened, like a wolf locking onto its prey.

Susan shoved him with all her might, but he didn't budge an inch.

"Henry, this time there can't be any mistakes!" Nicole's sultry voice suddenly carried through. "Susan and that bastard of hers both have to die!"

"Don't worry, I'll make sure their deaths are spectacular," Henry cooed before planting a kiss on her.

"That fire in Willow Lane happened because of the incompetent fools you hired! It ruined my engagement party!"

"This time, nothing will go wrong," Henry fawned over her like a lapdog. "My sweet Nicole, don't be angry."

Susan's blood ran cold. That fire hadn't been an accident—it was attempted murder!

Vincent's brow furrowed. He'd assumed Susan had faked her death to escape, never imagining someone truly wanted her dead.

Nicole's cruelty turned his stomach. All that talk of undying love was just a cover for her affair behind Andrew Lucas's back.

"Let me go!" Susan hissed under her breath.

Vincent suddenly turned and silently locked the bathroom door.

He leaned in, his heated gaze fixed on her painted lips. Even without makeup, she was captivating—but this bold look was downright lethal.

The noises outside grew more shameless, and Vincent's breathing noticeably roughened.

He seized the back of her head and crushed his mouth to hers in a fierce kiss.

"Be mine," he threatened between ragged breaths against her lips, "or I'll hand you over to them right now."
###Chapter 185: Consuming Longing

Vincent's fingers dug into his palms.

He stared at the blurred silhouette moving behind the frosted glass of the bathroom, his Adam's apple bobbing violently. Nicole Capra and Henry Bartley were just outside, yet all he could think about were Susan Thompson's tear-filled eyes.

"Susan." His voice was hoarse, barely recognizable. "Come with me."

Susan pressed her back against the cold tiles, the scent of antiseptic mixing with his ambergris cologne. She clenched the fabric of her clothes, her nails nearly tearing through.

"Mr. King, are you resorting to kidnapping now?" Her laugh was bitter, the corners of her eyes red like a cornered animal. "Too bad I don't bend easily."

Vincent suddenly gripped her waist.

"What are you doing?" Susan gasped, then bit her lip hard. The muffled sounds from outside continued, making her tremble.

"Shh." His scorching lips brushed her earlobe. "Unless you want them to find us, behave."

His hand trailed up her spine, every touch igniting fire. Susan suddenly remembered the boy who had fed her medicine in the dungeon, her eyes stinging.

"One million." Vincent's voice cut through the silence. "For one night."

Susan jerked her head up, meeting his darkened gaze. Her pale reflection stared back—like a sacrifice on an altar.

"How generous." Her shoulders shook with laughter. "But I have standards."

Vincent's expression turned icy.

He yanked her collar open, his pupils contracting at the sight of fading bite marks on her collarbone. "Andrew Lucas can touch you, but I can't?" His voice was laced with frost. "Susan, who are you pretending to be?"

Susan raised her hand.

"Go ahead." He caught her wrist and pinned it against the wall. "Let everyone outside see how Mr. King forced himself on a cripple."

The words stabbed like a knife. Susan looked down at her deformed left foot and laughed until tears spilled. "So this is your taste, Mr. King."

Vincent's breath hitched.

He remembered that stormy night three years ago—Susan dragging her broken leg through the flames, her nails caked with blood as she clutched a photo frame.

"Why..." His thumb traced the scar on her wrist, his voice breaking. "You smile for others but won't even look at me?"

Susan froze.

Neon lights filtered through the steam, casting a glow on the scar running from Vincent's brow to his jaw. She reached out instinctively but pulled back at the last second.

"Mr. King." Slowly, she unwound the bloodied bandage on her left hand. "If you stab me every day and then ask why I don't love you..." The gauze peeled away with a sickening stickiness, making her gasp. "Isn't that just cruel?"

Vincent stared at the raw wound, then suddenly slammed his fist into the wall.

"Susan!" He pressed his forehead to her shoulder, shaking. "I must be out of my damn mind—"

A knock cut him off.

"Who's in there?" Nicole's saccharine voice slithered through the door crack. "Henry, I think we have a little mouse~"
###Chapter 186: Nicole Capra's Downfall

"You can't possibly love me, Vincent. Unless you've gone mad."

Mad?

Vincent King's pupils contracted sharply, his knuckles turning white. His burning rage suddenly died when his gaze landed on Susan Thompson's maimed left hand.

Who would love someone who hurt them?

Only a madman.

He staggered to his feet, his tailored trousers soaked. He wanted to storm out, but froze when he heard suggestive noises from outside.

Susan seized the chance to shrink into the corner, her back pressed against cold tiles.

Vincent's lips twisted into a bitter smile at her defensive posture.

Even now, despised by her, he still wanted her. Not just physically—but something deeper.

What was it?

He didn't dare dwell on it.

"Susan, I'm sorry."

The words were wrenched from his chest, raw with unprecedented sincerity.

Susan froze. For the first time, she saw genuine remorse in his eyes.

"It's all in the past," she murmured, lowering her lashes.

Those years of shared hardship, those soul-crushing betrayals—it was time to move on.

The bathroom fell into suffocating silence.

Outside, Nicole Capra's voice filtered through as she took a call. Soon, the click of high heels faded, followed by Henry Bartley's departure.

Susan waited ten more minutes before emerging.

She swiftly retrieved the hidden pinhole camera from the vase and fled the private room without a backward glance.

The taxi sped through the night.

Back in her apartment, Susan frowned at her laptop screen. The entangled bodies in the video made her stomach churn. Nicole was no "Pure Jade Maiden"—she was a nymphomaniac.

Susan had thoughtfully pixelated the explicit parts, but it was enough to expose Nicole's true colors to the world.

She clicked "Send."

Wrapping herself tighter in the blanket, Susan smiled coldly. This was only the beginning.

Meanwhile, Nicole stood in the dressing room of an awards ceremony.

"Jenny, this dress is perfection!" She stroked the ruby-studded hem, admiring her breathtaking reflection.

Jenny Keene smirked. "Bella Lucas had to fly abroad suddenly. This is our golden opportunity."

Under the spotlight, Nicole ascended the stage in fifteen-centimeter heels. The red gown flared like flames, drawing ecstatic screams.

"Goddess Nicole!"

"Stunning!"

Amid the cheers, someone suddenly gasped, "Check the trending hashtag! That woman in the video looks like Nicole!"

Nicole, basking in adoration, didn't notice the growing commotion—until her ashen-faced assistant rushed over and whispered in her ear.

Her radiant smile shattered.
###Chapter 187: Andrew Lucas Was Her First Man

A sudden commotion erupted in the back of the venue.

A young man wearing black-framed glasses shot to his feet. His phone screen glowed unnaturally bright in the dim lighting. His face turned ghostly pale as he stared at the screen, fingers trembling uncontrollably.

"This can't be..." he muttered under his breath.

His companion leaned over curiously, then gasped. "Holy shit! Isn't that Nicole Capra?"

The video showed a woman with half-removed clothing entangled with an unfamiliar man. That face—it was unmistakably Nicole Capra, who currently stood radiant on stage.

"Bullshit!" The bespectacled man exploded in rage. "Nicole would never do this! She's been saving herself for Andrew Lucas!"

Yet the ruby wristwatch in the video matched the one gleaming on Nicole's wrist on stage.

Several of Bella Lucas' fans in the front rows snickered. "Oh? The 'Pure Jade Maiden' image crumbling already?"

"Shut up!" the glasses-wearing man roared. "This is obviously deepfake! Someone's trying to sabotage Nicole!"

A pink-haired girl nearby waved her phone. "Nice try. I just received it too. HD, uncensored. Even the mole on her waist is crystal clear."

Whispers spread like wildfire through the crowd.

On stage, Nicole gracefully fielded reporters' questions.

"Andrew and I..." She lowered her eyes demurely. "The wedding preparations are underway."

A reporter pressed, "Rumor has it Mr. Lucas particularly admires your chaste virtue?"

Nicole's lips curved into a practiced smile. "Andrew was my first man. And he'll be my last."

The moment the words left her mouth, a suited man charged onto the stage, shoving a phone in her face. "Miss Capra, care to explain this video?"

The main screen flickered. In high definition, Nicole straddled a balding man, her wanton behavior a stark contrast to her poised stage presence.

The audience erupted.

Nicole's smile froze. She staggered back, the microphone crashing to the floor with a deafening screech.

"That's not me..." Her voice shook. "It's doctored..."

No one listened. Chaos consumed the venue—fans tore up support banners, reporters' cameras flashed relentlessly.

From the VIP section, Andrew Lucas rose without expression. He walked toward the exit without a backward glance.

Nicole stretched out a desperate hand. "Andrew, let me explain—"

The slamming door was his only reply.
###Chapter 188: Nicole Capra's Image Shatters!

Security personnel rushed toward the stage, attempting to restrain the out-of-control male fan. Seeing this, Nicole Capra instantly adjusted her expression, flashing her signature sweet smile.

"Let's talk this through calmly, friend." She took an elegant step forward, her dress swaying gently.

The fan's eyes were bloodshot as he tremblingly raised his phone. "Nicole! The video of you and Henry Bartley is everywhere online! I refuse to believe it's real!"

Nicole's heart skipped a beat, but she maintained her composure. "What video? May I see it?"

When the images came into clear view, her smile froze instantly. The entangled figures in the footage made her blood run cold.

"This...this isn't me..." She instinctively retreated half a step, her voice beginning to shake.

The fan suddenly lunged, shoving her to the ground. "Liar! I've spent so much money on you! Is this how you repay your fans?!"

Nicole fell awkwardly, her dress tearing to reveal large patches of skin. The venue erupted in uproar.

Reporters surged forward, camera flashes exploding like fireworks.

"Miss Capra, isn't that the same watch you're wearing now in the video?"
"Does Andrew Lucas know about your relationship with Henry Bartley?"
"How do you plan to explain this to your fans?"

Nicole's face turned deathly pale as she struggled to stand. "This is clearly a maliciously edited—"

Before she could finish, a water bottle struck her forehead with a sickening thud.

"Get out of showbiz!"
"Slut!"
"Fraud!"

Formerly devoted fans began hurling objects at the stage. Nicole covered her head, her meticulously styled hair now in complete disarray.

"Everyone please remain calm—" The host's attempt to restore order was drowned out by the angry crowd.

Nicole staggered backward, her high heel snapping. She crashed onto the stage, sharp pain shooting through her ankle. But the sea of furious faces below terrified her more.

"I was framed!" she sobbed desperately, but no one listened.

A female reporter smirked while livestreaming on her phone. "Netizens, behold the true colors of your so-called 'Pure Goddess' Nicole Capra!"

The giant screen displayed a flood of real-time comments:
"Disgusting!"
"Poor Andrew Lucas"
"Ban her permanently!"

Nicole stared in despair, her nails digging deep into her palms. The perfect image she'd carefully cultivated for years had completely crumbled in this moment.
###Chapter 189: Nicole Capra Attempts Suicide!

The microphone creaked dangerously in Nicole's trembling grip.

She bit her lower lip until it bled, the metallic taste flooding her mouth.

The roar of the crowd below crashed over her like tidal waves. Faces that once cheered for her now twisted into grotesque masks of fury.

Thud—

A water bottle struck her forehead with brutal force.

Stars exploded behind her eyelids as she staggered back two steps.

By the time Jenny Keene rushed onstage with security, Nicole was already barefoot, her designer heels lost somewhere in the chaos.

The backstage mirror reflected her disheveled state. Jenny's hands shook as she offered tissues. "Nicole, I'll call PR immediately—"

"No." Nicole stared at her bloodshot reflection, nails digging crescent moons into her palms. "Arrange a meeting with Ethan Ash tonight."

The scandalous video spread like wildfire across social media.

Though the Capra family scrambled to remove all traces, public outrage had already spiraled out of control.

"Fake virgin! Listen to her moans in that video—who's she fooling?"

"Poor Andrew Lucas must be humiliated!"

"Someone should teach this bitch a lesson!"

Susan Thompson closed her laptop with a quiet click.

The storm had erupted more violently than she'd anticipated. Nicole's innocent-girl persona lay in ruins—but that viper wouldn't go down without a fight.

Beneath the covers, sleep eluded her. Nicole's whispered threats with Henry Bartley echoed in her mind—they were targeting Daniel.

Susan clenched the sheets until her knuckles turned white.

One misstep now would send her tumbling into the abyss.

Outside, winter winds howled against the penthouse windows.

Andrew Lucas stood silhouetted against the glass, his tie hanging loose around his neck.

The memory of Susan's trembling lashes as she'd adjusted his tie that morning tugged at his lips.

Knock knock—

Leo Miller entered with a pale face. "Sir, there's... an emergency. It's Miss Capra."

"Susan?" Andrew whirled around, shoulders relaxing slightly when Leo shook his head.

"The video with Henry Bartley..." Leo swallowed hard. "It's gone viral."

Andrew's eyes narrowed at the explicit footage.

Strangely, no rage came—only the sudden memory of another rainy night four years ago.

Henry pinning Susan beneath him.

"Bartley." The name dripped from his lips like poisoned honey.

A shrill ring shattered the silence.

Jenny's scream pierced through the receiver: "Mr. Lucas! Nicole slit her wrists! The ambulance is en route!"
###Chapter 190: Andrew's Promise

Nicole's fingers trembled as she swallowed the entire bottle of sleeping pills.

Andrew was in a meeting when the call came. He bolted upright, abandoning his suit jacket as he rushed from the conference room. Henry's private hospital had tight security, keeping the swarming reporters at bay.

The emergency room light burned crimson.

Andrew stared at that harsh glow, his heartbeat eerily calm. He didn't love Nicole, but she'd once saved his life. This debt demanded repayment.

Four hours later, the exhausted doctor pushed through the doors.

"Mr. Lucas, Ms. Capra is out of danger."

Nicole lay pale as parchment on the hospital bed, her breathing barely visible. Andrew remembered five years ago—how she'd looked just like this after selling a kidney to save him.

He gently clasped her icy hand.

"Nicole, don't do this."

Her lashes fluttered open. The stomach pumping had been agony, her throat raw with pain. She'd considered slitting her wrists but couldn't follow through. Sleeping pills seemed easier—until they weren't.

"Andrew..." Her whisper was ghostly, tears instantly overflowing.

"Is living so terrible?" His brow furrowed.

"I can't!" Nicole jerked upright, suddenly frantic. "Everyone thinks I'm filthy! Those fans...they threw garbage at me!" She trembled violently. "I scrubbed for three hours and still feel disgusting!"

Andrew pinned her thrashing hands. "I'll handle the video scandal."

"You don't believe me!" She shook her head wildly. "That wasn't me! I gave you my virginity, Andrew!" Her fingers clawed at his sleeve. "Someone framed me...it must've been that bitch Susan!"

His eyes turned glacial.

"Andrew." Nicole suddenly collapsed against his chest. "Don't leave me...you're all I have..." Her tears soaked through his shirt. "If you abandon me, I'll die..."

He stiffly patted her back.

"I can prove my innocence." Nicole abruptly straightened and yanked open her hospital gown before he could react.

Pale skin met the sterile air as she grabbed Andrew's hand, pressing it to her bare chest. "Feel me...I'm pure..."

Andrew snatched his hand back, yanking the sheet over her.

"Enough!"

Nicole gazed up through tear-spiked lashes, the ghost of a triumphant smile playing on her lips. She knew this man would never shake the chains of obligation.

"I promise," Andrew turned away, "I won't abandon you."

Outside the room, a slender figure slipped silently into the shadows. Susan clenched her fists until her nails drew blood from her palms.
###Chapter 191: Andrew, Give Me a Child

Nicole's sudden movement of unbuttoning her blouse caught Andrew completely off guard.

She stood before him, her pale skin glowing under the light. Yet his gaze remained as still as stagnant water.

Andrew suddenly found the situation absurd. This was his fiancée—the woman who should have stirred his heart—yet she couldn't ignite even a flicker of desire in him.

It was like admiring a beautifully packaged cut of meat in a supermarket. No matter how attractive, it was still just flesh.

Nicole's figure was flawless, her features exquisitely sculpted. But emotions were irrational. Love couldn't be forced, and no amount of beauty could move an indifferent heart.

Susan was different.

Even when fully clothed, that petite woman could shatter his self-control. A single glance from her was enough to unravel him, making him want to crush her into his very bones.

"Nicole..." Andrew bent down to pick up the coat from the floor and draped it gently over her shoulders.

Nicole violently shrugged it off, pressing her right hand tightly against her upper abdomen. She took a step back, then slowly moved her palm away. "Andrew, look closely! The woman in that video isn't me!"

"I'm missing a kidney. There will always be a scar here! That woman's stomach was smooth and unmarked—it wasn't me!"

Andrew's eyes dropped to where she pointed. A hideous scar stretched across her otherwise flawless skin, stark and unsettling.

He had only glanced at the video briefly, but he did recall the woman's abdomen being smooth as jade.

It wasn't Nicole.

The realization brought him relief—not for her sake, but because it meant he wouldn't have to endure this farce any longer. Yet that scar reminded him of what this woman had sacrificed for him.

"No one will slander you," Andrew said firmly, rewrapping the coat around her. "Anyone who dares to hurt you will answer to me."

"Andrew..." Tears streamed down Nicole's face as she clutched his sleeve with trembling fingers. "Tomorrow, I'll hold a press conference. I'll show the world this scar."

"I'll only reveal the scarred area..." She bit her lip, shame flashing in her eyes. "Do you think I'm despicable for doing this?"

"You will always be pure," Andrew answered without hesitation.

Nicole's heart surged with triumph. The scar was the work of a top-tier special effects artist she had paid handsomely—so realistic it could fool anyone. Once this storm passed, she would have a real scar tattooed there.

"Andrew!" Seeing him turn to leave, she threw her arms around him from behind. The coat slipped off again, and the moment her bare skin touched his, his entire body stiffened.

It felt like being smothered by a slab of greasy fat—disgusting enough to make him want to shake her off immediately.

"Don't go..." she begged, her voice breaking with tears. "You're repulsed by me, aren't you? You're with Susan now. You don't even want to touch me..."

"Why? I'm the one who gave everything for you. I'm the one who stayed pure. Yet she gets your heart so easily? It's not fair!"

Andrew closed his eyes briefly. The debt he owed her could never be repaid in this lifetime.

"Andrew, please..." Nicole pressed her face against his back, her voice shattered. "Give me a child. Please."
###Chapter 192: All the Filth Belongs to Susan Thompson Alone!

Andrew Lucas's fingertips trembled slightly.

Nicole Capra's request was reasonable, yet his legs felt like they were weighed down with lead.

"Focus on recovering." He pried her fingers from his sleeve and turned away, leaving a cold gust in his wake.

The moment the hospital door clicked shut, Nicole's nails dug deep into her palms.

She stood barefoot on the icy floor, scattered clothes like withered petals around her.

When Jenny Keene entered, she was met with Nicole's bloodshot eyes.

"Susan Thompson!"

The name slithered through clenched teeth, dripping with venomous hatred.

A chill ran down Jenny's spine, but she forced herself forward. "The press conference is all arranged."

"Not enough!" Nicole hurled a pillow at the wall. "I want her reputation destroyed! I want her begging for death!"

The shrill ring of a phone cut through the tension.

Henry Bartley's sycophantic voice oozed through the speaker. "Nicole, let's go public with our relationship."

"Shut up!" Her nails screeched against the phone case. "Henry, if you breathe a word of this, I'll make your life hell."

"I'll take care of Susan for you." His tone turned icy. "She'll be gone before sunset tomorrow."

After hanging up, Nicole studied her reflection with a smirk.

Tomorrow would be historic—her redemption, Susan's damnation.

Morning light filtered through the curtains as Susan examined her swollen left hand.

Benjamin Nash's treatments had restored some sensation to her arm, but Vincent King's kick last night had undone all progress.

In a corner diner, the TV broadcast Nicole's press conference live.

Dressed in white, Nicole faced the cameras with practiced fragility.

"That woman in the video isn't me."

She lifted scissors and sliced open the fabric over her abdomen before the flashing lenses.

"This scar is proof."

Gasps erupted through the crowd.

A bespectacled female reporter sneered. "Special effects makeup can fake gunshot wounds now. Care to get a medical verification, Miss Capra?"

Nicole's face drained of color.
###Chapter 193: Two Despicable Couples

Susan Thompson stared at her phone screen, her fingertip lightly brushing over the like button.

The female reporter's question had been a stroke of genius.

She knew better than anyone that Nicole Capra's abdomen bore no scar at all. That so-called "life-saving kidney" was nothing but an elaborately crafted lie.

In the video, Nicole visibly froze for a split second, a flicker of panic flashing in her eyes.

But she quickly composed herself.

"A hospital examination would be perfect—it'll clear my name," Nicole said with a gentle, graceful smile.

The reporter backed off, knowing better than to push the future Mrs. Lucas too far.

"Miss Capra, you must be joking. That scar looks completely real. I was just curious—how could someone as image-conscious as you end up with such a mark?"

Nicole bit her lip, hesitating.

Suddenly, Jenny Keene rushed forward, shielding Nicole behind her. "How much more do you want to torment her? She already took sleeping pills!"

"You want to know where the scar came from? I'll tell you!" Jenny's voice trembled with emotion. "Nicole lost a kidney!"

The crowd erupted in gasps.

"Miss Capra, how could—"

"Jenny!" Nicole grabbed her arm urgently. "Stop."

Jenny shook her off. "I can't take this anymore! Four years ago, Nicole sold her kidney to save Andrew Lucas!"

"Back then, Andrew was just a poor guy who got into a car accident and needed surgery. Nicole didn't know his real identity—she just wanted to raise money for—"

Susan smirked and closed the video.

As expected of an actress's manager—Jenny's performance was Oscar-worthy.

Scrolling through the news, Susan wasn't surprised by the outcome. Nicole had never been one to go down without a fight.

Public opinion had already begun shifting. Nicole's fans were in an uproar:

"I knew Nicole was the kindest!"

"This is the purest love story! I'm sobbing!"

"Apologize to her, haters!"

But some skeptical voices remained:

"Explain the limited-edition watch first?"

"Will she actually go to the hospital for verification?"

"That woman in the video had the same huge feet as Nicole!"

The comment about "huge feet" made Susan laugh out loud. Nicole's size 10 wide feet were infamous in the industry.

Though she hadn't landed a fatal blow, Susan was satisfied. Once seeds of doubt were planted, they would eventually take root.

After breakfast, Susan headed to the Hengdian studio.

Today was the photoshoot and promotional video for King's Glory, where she would portray the character Diao Chan. Though her hands were still swollen, the flowing sleeves of the ancient costume would hide them perfectly.

The originally planned barefoot scene had been changed to wearing shoes—a relief for her.

Arriving ten minutes early, Susan froze the moment she stepped into the studio.

Andrew Lucas walked in arm-in-arm with Nicole Capra, while Vincent King had his arm around Candy Wilson. The two picture-perfect couples were heading straight toward her.

What kind of luck was this? Susan rolled her eyes internally.
###Chapter 194: Vincent, You're Such a Fool!

Susan Thompson ignored the annoying crowd and walked straight to her designated shooting area. The massive studio was divided into different functional zones. Today she would film a promotional video for the Grant Corporation's new game.

Nicole Capra and Candy Wilson were also present. After losing the endorsement deal for King's Glory, Nicole had stubbornly secured a deal for another game. Candy managed to land a minor role through her connections.

Andrew Lucas hadn't planned to come until Leo Miller mentioned Susan would be filming here. That changed his mind.

Candy blocked Susan's path in her high heels. "Susan, I'm really sorry about what happened in the underground parking lot that day." She put on a pitiful act. "Can you forgive me?"

"Cut the act, Candy." Susan sneered. "If I crippled you and said it was an accident, would you forgive me?"

"Only fools would believe your two-faced behavior."

"Susan!" Vincent King roared, recognizing the insult directed at him.

"Mr. King, are you reminding me of my own name?" Susan curled her lips mockingly. "Don't worry, I'm not stupid enough to forget it."

She walked away, her ankle injury nearly healed.

Vincent's veins bulged with rage, while Andrew couldn't help smirking. Seeing Vincent humiliated gave him inexplicable pleasure.

Candy clung to Vincent's arm. "The director will be an hour late. Let's watch Susan's shoot? I want to apologize properly."

Nicole cursed Candy's stupidity but had to follow Andrew.

The Grant Corporation's extravagance was astounding. Over a dozen exquisite costumes were prepared just for the Diao Chan character, all designed by master tailors.

Candy immediately coveted the red low-cut ancient dress—a limited edition piece by Elysium designer Liam Quinn, the only one in existence. Her eyes burned with jealousy.

Nicole was drawn to a blue-and-pink winter outfit. The fresh color scheme captivated her.

"Vincent, that red dress is gorgeous," Candy cooed. "Wouldn't it be amazing to wear it for the shoot?"

Susan rolled her eyes internally. Candy's figure would be a disaster in that revealing outfit.

Vincent's face darkened as he imagined Susan wearing the sexy dress for public viewing. Just as he was about to explode, a cold voice cut through:

"Let her wear it."
###Chapter 195: Mistaken Obsession

Susan Thompson froze in place.

Alexander Grant stood silhouetted against the light, his tailored suit accentuating his aristocratic bearing. She never expected the busy heir of the Grant conglomerate to personally oversee the promotional shoot.

"Prince Grant..." Candy Wilson's eyes lit up with manic delight.

Alexander was giving her this haute couture gown! What did this mean?

It meant she was special in his eyes! With a good performance today, she might even land the King's Glory endorsement!

Candy straightened her posture, flashing her sweetest smile. "Thank you, Prince Grant!"

Alexander didn't even glance at her, merely lifting his chin dismissively. Patrick Pope understood the silent command and reluctantly removed the gown.

Patrick winced. This dress was worth a fortune—nearly matching Susan's endorsement fee—and now it was being handed to someone else?

Had his boss suddenly developed a taste for married women?

He didn't dare question it, obediently presenting the gown to Candy.

Candy clutched it eagerly. The weight of the lustrous pearls against her fingertips made her pulse race. This was undoubtedly top-tier custom work.

"Vincent, I'm going to try it on!" Candy batted her lashes at Vincent King before sashaying into the dressing room.

When she reemerged, the room fell silent.

The exquisite gown looked utterly incongruous on her. The plunging neckline exposed her flat chest, the fabric gaping with every movement. Worse, her thick waist strained the seams, splitting the dress open.

Candy sensed something amiss but quickly reassured herself—such an expensive dress had to look stunning!

She strutted past Susan, deliberately thrusting out her chest.

Susan: "..."

"Prince Grant, it's breathtaking!" Candy twirled, the skirt flaring. She gazed adoringly at Vincent. "Vincent, do I look beautiful?"

Vincent's eyes slid past her, fixing on Susan.

He imagined Susan wearing that dress.

Candy's figure was boyish, but Susan... Vincent's throat moved. That slender waist he'd dreamed of gripping countless times. Those lush curves that set his blood boiling with just a memory.

"Vincent?" Candy cooed.

In his daze, Vincent saw Susan walking toward him. He yanked Candy into his arms and crushed his lips to hers.

Candy flushed crimson. This was the first time Vincent had shown her such passion in public!

"Vincent..." She shyly closed her eyes.

"Susan, you're mine!" Vincent's hoarse growl exploded against her lips.

Candy's face drained of color.

Andrew Lucas scoffed. "Really, Mr. King? Using someone as a substitute?"

Vincent jolted awake. Taking in the woman in his arms, he shoved her away in disgust. Candy stumbled to the floor, tears welling. "Vincent, how could you do this to me?"
###Chapter 196: The Battlefield Between Andrew Lucas and Alexander Grant

"Susan?" Vincent King's brows furrowed instantly. He hadn't expected his momentary distraction to hurt Candy Wilson.

He strode forward and pulled her into a tight embrace. His heart clenched when his fingers brushed the red marks on her arm.

Candy felt as if a sharp blade had sliced through her heart. She feared Vincent would utter that name—the truth behind his distraction over Susan Thompson.

"Vincent, I trust you." She buried her face in his chest, voice trembling. "After all we've been through, nothing can tear us apart."

Her nails dug deep into her palms. She had come to humiliate Susan, only to make a fool of herself.

"Vincent, I have a headache." She tugged at his sleeve. "Let's go home, please?"

"Miss Wilson, wait." Alexander Grant's icy voice cut through the air.

Candy's eyes lit up. Had the illustrious Alexander Grant finally noticed her?

"Mr. Grant, is there something you need?" She flashed her most polished smile.

Alexander's stomach churned. Suppressing his disgust, he replied flatly, "We need to discuss compensation for the damaged dress."

"What?" Her smile froze. "But... wasn't this a gift for me?"

"Miss Wilson, you flatter yourself." His gaze turned mocking. "We're strangers."

Candy's face paled instantly. She looked down at the exquisite embroidered gown, the golden threads stinging her eyes under the lights.

"If you hadn't made me wear it—"

"I suggested you wear it, not burst its seams." Alexander cut her off.

Nearby, Patrick Pope nearly applauded. So his boss was avenging Susan!

Andrew Lucas's lips had just curved into a smirk when he realized Alexander's motive, and his expression hardened.

"This dress is worth ten million," Alexander said coolly. "Master Li values it highly."

Candy's legs gave way, and she collapsed to the floor. The sound of tearing fabric was deafening as she scrambled to cover herself, to no avail.

"Couldn't fit but forced yourself in anyway." Andrew sneered. "Miss Wilson, was the humiliation not enough?"

Vincent shielded Candy behind him, his gaze sharp as a blade. "Two million. You'll have it shortly. My woman can do as she pleases."

He dragged Candy away, his retreating figure radiating fury.

Nicole Capra whispered, "Should we check on Candy?"

"Go watch a fool?" Andrew remained unmoved. Nicole immediately fell silent.

Filming finally began. Susan stared at the revised script, her ears burning.

"My general, let this humble servant..." She couldn't bring herself to say the line.

Director Cyrus stepped in to play Lu Bu. When the script called for an embrace and kiss, Alexander snatched the script from Patrick's hands.

"I'll do it." He unbuttoned his suit jacket, his intense gaze fixed on Susan.

Andrew shot to his feet. "Alexander Grant, what do you think you're doing?"

The air crackled with tension. Susan stood on the swing, watching the two men square off, and massaged her temples in exasperation.
###Chapter 197: Alexander and Susan's Kiss That Shook the Set

Gasps erupted across the studio.

News of Alexander Grant joining the shoot detonated like a bomb.

Director Cyrus trembled with excitement.

This was Alexander Grant—the heir to the Grant empire!

"Fantastic! Get everything ready now!"

Costumers rushed forward with a silver armor set.

Andrew Lucas watched coldly from the sidelines.

His gaze remained locked on Susan Thompson.

Nicole Capra clung to his arm. "Andrew, don't they look perfect together?"

"Shut up."

The entire set held its breath when Alexander emerged from makeup.

Moonlight glinted off his silver armor.

His chiseled features looked sculpted by gods.

"Action!"

Susan sat on a flower-adorned swing.

Her butter-yellow dress fluttered in the breeze.

Recognition flashed in her eyes when she saw Alexander.

She leaped forward.

Alexander caught her effortlessly.

Their eyes met.

As his lips descended, Susan closed her eyes.

The kiss came unexpectedly.

Yet felt inevitable.

Andrew's fists clenched.

"Cut! Perfection!" Director Cyrus cheered.

Nicole's eyes burned with envy. "They're truly made for each other."

Andrew shook her off.

Silence blanketed the set.

The kiss had left everyone breathless.

Susan's cheeks burned crimson.

Alexander's thumb grazed her swollen lips.

"Again?"

His voice dripped with dark promise.

Susan turned away flustered.

This man's allure was dangerous.

Andrew suddenly stormed forward.

"Enough."

His voice could freeze hell.

Alexander arched a brow. "Any objections, Mr. Lucas?"

Tension crackled between them.

Susan stood trapped between the two men.

Her heart threatened to pound out of her chest.
###Chapter 198: Mr. Lucas, Is That Jealousy I Smell?

Susan Thompson performed the staged kissing scene effortlessly before the camera.

Having decided to enter the entertainment industry, she understood the need to follow its rules.

Kissing scenes were fundamental for actors. If she couldn't handle this, she might as well quit now.

Alexander Grant's lips merely brushed her cheek—less intimate than a European air kiss.

Yet that fleeting contact sent his heart racing wildly.

His palm rested on her slender waist, fingertips burning. Only his ironclad self-control kept him from crushing her against him.

"Cut!"

Director Cyrus's call eased the tension in Andrew Lucas's rigid posture. His knuckles whitened as he glared at the set.

"Miss Thompson, excellent performance," Director Cyrus rubbed his hands. "But something's missing."

Patrick Pope chimed in, "Authenticity. The fake kiss looks staged."

"Exactly!" The director's eyes lit up. "Lu Bu and Diao Chan's passion should be more intense. This kiss..."

He glanced at Alexander, hesitating.

"Should I demonstrate?" The director immediately regretted his offer and turned to Patrick.

"I'm allergic to pollen!" Patrick covered his mouth, backing away. "Contagious!"

An awkward silence fell.

Patrick pulled the director aside. "Haven't you noticed Mr. Grant's special interest in Miss Thompson?"

The director's eyes widened in realization.

"Then..." he ventured cautiously, "should we switch to a real kiss?"

Alexander remained impassive. "Sacrificing for art is an actor's duty."

Andrew's gaze turned glacial.

"I..." Susan hesitated.

"Any objections, Miss Thompson?" The director leaned forward eagerly.

Andrew stared at her with murderous intensity.

"No problem." Susan took a deep breath. "I have the professionalism expected of any actor."

Those words ignited Andrew's fury completely.
###Chapter 199: Possessive Rage

She couldn't wait to throw herself into Alexander Grant's arms?!

He thought four years would make her more restrained, but she remained just as shameless!

Throwing herself at any man she saw, forgetting all decency!

Playing the chaste innocent in front of him, then leaping into another man's embrace!

The filming resumed.

Susan Thompson swayed gently on the swing when she spotted a uniformed man galloping toward her. Her dull eyes instantly brightened, lips curving in awe.

She leaped from the swing, landing perfectly in Alexander's arms.

His gaze burned into her, dark as the ocean, surging with long-suppressed yearning. He spun her around—this normally composed man now looked like a lovestruck boy.

He captured her lips in a kiss.

Susan's cheeks burned. Though instinct urged her to push away, she obediently closed her eyes.

"Susan!"

Andrew Lucas's roar was drowned by the set's noise. His knuckles whitened as he glared at the entangled pair.

Nicole Capra tugged his sleeve. "Andrew, my scene is starting..."

He ignored her. Only when the kiss ended did he suppress the urge to charge forward.

Flushed, Susan stepped back, silk sleeves fluttering. "General, let this humble maiden dance for you..."

Her movements enchanted even Director Cyrus, who'd seen countless performers.

More shocking was Alexander's reaction—the man rumored to disdain women had clearly lost control.

Patrick Pope covered his face. His boss turned into a starved wolf around Miss Thompson.

"Mr. Grant, thank you for your hard work," Susan said politely after filming.

Alexander's gaze scorched her. "You owe me a meal."

She froze.

Patrick wished the ground would swallow him. The mighty tycoon, begging a girl for dinner?

Nicole whispered poison in Andrew's ear: "The Grant heir has never shown such interest. Your sister seemed quite taken too, blushing like that..."

Blushing?!

Andrew's mind flashed to her crimson cheeks and that demure "humble maiden." His restraint snapped.

Shoving Nicole aside, he seized Susan's wrist. "You enjoy calling yourself a humble maiden for men?!"

Susan winced. "It's scripted dialogue!"

"Did you enjoy his kiss?" Andrew's voice dripped ice.

She smirked. "Want to try, Mr. Lucas? Pity Mr. Grant wouldn't stoop to your level."

"Susan!" His grip tightened, eyes bloodshot.

Alexander's warning rumbled. "Release her."

Andrew sneered. "Alexander, do you really enjoy taking my leftovers?"
###Chapter 200: Andrew, You Don't Deserve Susan

Andrew Lucas's words stabbed Susan Thompson's heart like a knife.

The staff's expressions shifted instantly—admiration turning to disdain. Whispers rippled through the crowd.

"She's two-timing them."

"Alexander Grant must be blind."

"I heard Andrew and Nicole Capra are the real couple."

Susan's face paled. Her fingers trembled slightly. The cruel remarks pierced her like needles.

Suddenly, Alexander stepped forward, shielding her.

"Andrew, you don't deserve Susan."

His quiet voice silenced the room.

Susan looked up into Alexander's steady gaze. There was no contempt—only pure trust.

"To me, you'll always be the best woman."

The words made her eyes sting. It reminded her of what her brother Ethan Sullivan had once said.

Andrew's expression darkened.

"The best woman?" He sneered. "Are you blind, Alexander? How does she deserve that?"

"Mr. Lucas!" Susan fought to keep her voice steady. "If I'm so unworthy, then let me go."

Only then did Andrew realize he was still gripping her wrist, leaving angry red marks. He released her abruptly—but Alexander had already pulled Susan behind him.

"Andrew, be a man." Alexander's tone was icy. "Act like someone who's divorced."

"Divorced?" Pain flashed in Andrew's eyes. "It's not that simple between us."

His voice rose sharply. "Susan, you're the one who betrayed me!"

Susan almost laughed. Where was this righteousness when he'd hurt Daniel for Nicole's sake?

Alexander spoke again. "Andrew, you betrayed Susan."

"Cheating with Nicole during your marriage—getting her pregnant—that's infidelity."

Gasps filled the room. Staff members exchanged shocked glances.

"Nicole was the homewrecker?"

"So Susan was the real wife..."

Nicole's face twisted. Her nails dug into her palms.

"Alexander!" she shrieked. "Do you know what she did to me?"

Andrew stood frozen. Alexander's words hit him like a sledgehammer.

Infidelity. Betrayal.

These concepts had never applied to him. He'd always believed himself the victim.

Now, he wasn't so sure.
###Chapter 201: Alexander Grant Publicly Humiliates Nicole Capra

"My sister killed my baby!"

Nicole Capra sobbed dramatically, expecting to provoke Alexander Grant's fury. Instead, his gaze remained tender when he looked at Susan Thompson, but turned icy with disdain when it landed on her.

"A homewrecker dares to speak of children?" Alexander's lips curled into a mocking smile, his godlike features radiating contempt. "Nicole, even if Susan did it, you got what you deserved."

"Alexander!" Nicole paled, too afraid to retaliate, so she played the victim. "Andrew and I truly love each other. It's my sister who—"

"Pathetic." Alexander cut her off with a cold laugh. "True love with a married man? Your audacity is astounding."

"Pfft—" Patrick Pope couldn't suppress a chuckle. The usually reserved heir was lethally sarcastic when provoked.

"How shameless! She seduced a married man!"
"Pure Jade Maiden? More like a scheming homewrecker!"
"Poor Susan, her marriage ruined by someone like this."
"Susan seems happier now. Look how Alexander dotes on her!"

Whispers erupted around them, making Nicole's face alternate between red and white.

Alexander suddenly leaned in, his voice a venomous whisper. "I heard Andrew was blackout drunk that night. How exactly did you get pregnant?"

Without waiting for a response, he grabbed Susan's hand and walked away.

"Don't forget our date tonight." He gave her hand a gentle squeeze before leaving.

Susan focused on the makeup artist, ignoring the burning stares behind her.

Nicole chased after Andrew Lucas, tears streaming down her face. "Andrew, you have to believe me! The baby was yours!"

Andrew nodded absently. "Yeah, I believe you."

"But Alexander called me a homewrecker..." she probed.

Andrew fell silent. For the first time, he questioned whether his revenge against Susan had been justified.

Then Nicole's phone rang. After the call, her eyes gleamed with triumph, though her expression remained pitiful. "Andrew, Jenny found out... Susan leaked the video to the media!"

"What?" Andrew frowned.

"Why would she do this to me?" Nicole burst into fresh tears. "If not for my kidney donation scar, my reputation would be ruined!"

Andrew immediately ordered Leo Miller to investigate. The IP address traced back to Susan's apartment.

His fists clenched, torn between rage and guilt. In the end, he only instructed Leo to suppress the news, forbidding any further investigation.

As night fell, Andrew stood outside Susan's apartment, ringing the doorbell repeatedly with no answer.

Then he remembered—she had a date with Alexander.

His eyes darkened.

A candlelit dinner? He'd make sure she didn't enjoy it under his watch.
###Chapter 202: Susan, I'm Pursuing You!

Susan Thompson never planned to have dinner with Alexander Grant.

The Diao Chan costume change required eight different looks, each demanding full hair and makeup redo. By the time they finished the final stills, the sunset had painted half the sky crimson.

Her nearly healed ankle throbbed faintly after the day's exertion. All she wanted was to return to her apartment, soak in a hot bath, and collapse into bed.

Stepping out of the studio, she spotted Alexander leaning against his car.

Remembering she owed him a meal—and considering he was Benjamin Nash's grandson—Susan took a deep breath. Tonight would settle that debt.

Someone of Alexander's status belonged at places like Elegant Joy. But after encountering Kevin Oak there last time, Susan couldn't stomach returning.

Alexander seemed to read her mind, leading them to an unassuming eatery.

Susan froze at the familiar sign.

This Sichuan restaurant near her high school was where she and Andrew Lucas used to splurge on boiled fish every week.

"You've been here before?" Alexander noted her distant expression.

"Yes." She traced the menu absently. "Came often with friends during high school."

Her finger paused at the boiled fish section. "Their signature dish. Excellent flavor."

"Your choice tonight." His gaze remained on her face. "I defer to the expert."

Susan ordered from memory, deliberately avoiding the stir-fried bamboo shoots she once loved. Now the dish only brought painful recollections.

The owner recognized her immediately. "Susan! Still as beautiful after all these years!" Her eyes flicked to Alexander. "And this is—"

"He's not—"

"I'm her boyfriend." Alexander's deep voice cut through, firm and deliberate.

Susan nearly knocked over her water glass, staring at him in shock. He simply offered one of his rare smiles.

The owner beamed. "I knew such a lovely girl would—"

Her words died as she looked past Susan's shoulder, expression shifting. Susan turned to see Andrew Lucas silhouetted in the doorway, his tall frame radiating icy tension.

The owner discreetly withdrew, leaving strained silence between the trio.

Before Susan could process Alexander's declaration, he spoke again. "Our blind date never concluded, Susan."

His quiet words carried clearly. "Because I'm currently pursuing you."

The statement detonated like a bomb in the small restaurant. Susan felt twin scorching gazes—one from Alexander before her, one from Andrew at the door.

Her fingers clenched the tablecloth unconsciously, her heartbeat threatening to burst from her chest.
###Chapter 203: Susan, How Dare You Seduce a Man in Public!

Susan's heart skipped a beat. Alexander Grant's sudden confession caught her completely off guard.

She appreciated his trust, but being pursued by such a powerful man would only make her a target.

She had no desire to become every woman's enemy in the city.

More importantly, her heart had long turned to ashes.

"Mr. Grant, we're not compatible." Susan despised playing with people's emotions. She preferred clean breaks.

"Right now, I just want to focus on work and secure a stable future for Daniel."

That blind date had only happened to appease Benjamin Nash. With her broken body, why burden someone else?

"Daniel needs a father." Alexander's intense gaze seemed to pierce through her soul. "And I'm the best candidate."

"I know you need time. I'm willing to wait."

Susan took a sip of water. She couldn't deny his logic—Daniel did need a father. With the Grant family's influence, they could protect Daniel even if she were gone.

But she couldn't be that selfish.

"Mr. Grant, I appreciate your affection, but this really isn't possible."

The timely arrival of steaming dishes broke the awkward silence.

Susan eagerly placed a piece of fish on Alexander's plate. "Try their boiled fish—it's deliciously spicy!"

The memory of Nicole forcing her to swallow live fish still haunted her. Yet the aromatic scent made her mouth water involuntarily.

She loved fish soup, and this restaurant's broth was exceptionally flavorful.

But her stomach couldn't handle it now. She could only stare longingly.

Alexander wasn't surprised by her rejection. Amused by her craving, he carefully deboned the fish and placed tender white flesh in her bowl.

When she hesitated, he arched an eyebrow. "Too good to eat?"

"I... can't handle spicy food." Suppressing her desire, she picked at some stir-fried vegetables instead.

Alexander frowned. She'd clearly praised this restaurant's signature spicy fish before—a regular wouldn't suddenly develop an aversion.

"How is it?" Susan watched him with hopeful eyes.

Her restrained longing tugged at his heartstrings. The poised woman had such an adorable side.

"Delicious." He took another bite truthfully.

Susan smiled contentedly, as if tasting it herself.

Alexander's heartbeat quickened as he studied her. He knew—he could never let this woman go.

"Did you attend high school nearby?" When she nodded, he suggested, "Show me after dinner."

Susan instinctively wanted to refuse. Not just to maintain distance, but because her swollen ankle throbbed painfully.

"Sorry, my foot hurts. I'd like to rest early."

Alexander set down his chopsticks, eyes dropping to her visibly swollen ankle beneath the sock.

Compelled, he knelt and grasped her foot.

Susan's eyes widened. Though the restaurant was empty, this crossed all boundaries.

"Mr. Grant, please—"

"Stay still." His firm hands massaged through the fabric.

Susan wished the ground would swallow her. As she struggled, an enraged voice exploded:

"What the hell are you doing?!"

She turned to meet Andrew Lucas's bloodshot eyes.

Andrew trembled with fury. Learning Susan had brought Alexander to their old dating spot nearly made him destroy his office.

Worse—she'd taken their usual table!

He'd rushed over restraining his rage, only to see her serving Alexander like some doting wife!

He used to pick bones from her fish, spoon-feed her soup, treasure her like porcelain!

Now she was publicly seducing another man! Alexander's hand was in her sock!

What next? Couldn't they wait?!

"Susan!" His fist slammed the table, scalding soup splashing unnoticed on his skin. "That desperate for a man? Can't even keep your clothes on in public?!"

Susan coldly withdrew her foot. "Mr. Lucas, what we do is none of your concern!"
###Chapter 204: Andrew's Coquettish Plea for Comfort

"Susan, are you that desperate to climb into Alexander Grant's bed?" Andrew's voice was icy, his eyes dark with stormy rage.

Susan smirked coldly. "Mr. Lucas, who I choose to be with is none of your business!"

"You're mine." He seized her wrist with crushing force.

"Yours?" Her lips curled in mockery. "Andrew Lucas, are you even worthy? Nicole Capra's man has no right to question me."

His pupils contracted sharply, his grip loosening slightly.

Susan wrenched free and grabbed her bag, bolting outside. The night wind hit her face—she hadn't realized she'd been crying.

Pathetic, she scolded herself.

Blinding headlights suddenly flooded her vision. She raised a hand to shield her eyes—just as the car accelerated straight toward her.

A dark figure tackled her to the ground at the last second. They tumbled onto the roadside as the car grazed Andrew's arm and sped away.

"Andrew!" Susan gasped.

He groaned but immediately checked her for injuries. Under the streetlight, Susan recognized the driver's twisted face—Candy Wilson.

"Are you hurt?" His voice trembled.

She pushed him away. "Not your concern."

Alexander Grant rushed out just in time to see the taillights disappearing. His expression darkened as he memorized the license plate—then spotted Andrew still gripping Susan.

"I'll take you home," both men said simultaneously.

Susan shook them off and hailed a taxi.

The chatty driver rambled about trivial matters as Susan stared blankly at the passing city lights.

At her doorstep, a shadow lunged from the darkness. She stumbled back—Andrew.

"Are you insane? Scaring people at this hour!"

He pinned her against the door, crimson eyes burning. "Why did you hurt Nicole? You leaked that video, didn't you?"

Susan laughed. "Yes, it was me. I want her ruined."

She braced for fury—but his grip slackened as he slumped against her.

"Susan..." His voice softened unexpectedly. "My arm hurts..."

She froze. The ruthless business titan now nuzzled her neck like a wounded animal.

"Let... let me go..."

"No." He buried his face deeper. "Not until you promise to treat my wound."

The night breeze carried the metallic tang of blood. Susan sighed—her resolve crumbling.
###Chapter 205: Andrew's Shameless Persistence

Susan's fingers trembled, nearly dropping her keys.

Andrew's sudden vulnerability caught her off guard. The cold, domineering man she remembered now clung to her like a child begging for candy.

"Mr. Lucas, infected wounds can kill." Her tone was deliberately harsh. "I don't want a wrongful death lawsuit on my hands."

"Susan..." His voice was muffled, warm breath brushing her nape. "It hurts."

Those three words stabbed her heart like a blunt knife. She clenched her jaw, refusing to look at his pale face.

"Let Leo take you to the hospital." She fumbled with the keys, her hands shaking uncontrollably.

It took three tries to fit the key into the lock. A low chuckle behind her made her ears burn with embarrassment.

"What's so funny?"

"Nothing." Andrew leaned closer, his injured arm loosely encircling her. "Just... your shaky hands are adorable."

Susan shoved the door open and stormed inside. The first-aid kit clattered as she rummaged through it, then hurled a tube of ointment at him.

"Do it yourself!"

Andrew didn't catch it. The tube hit his chest and fell to the floor. As he bent to pick it up, he groaned and dropped to one knee.

"You—" She instinctively stepped forward but stopped herself. "Stop faking!"

Andrew looked up, sweat beading on his forehead. His black shirt was soaked with blood, clinging to the gruesome wound. He tried to lift his arm, his muscles tensing in pain.

"Can't... move it."

Susan balled her fists. Four years ago, on that rainy night, he had knelt outside her family's villa just like this, letting the storm wash over his wounds. Memory and reality overlapped, making her eyes sting.

"Serves you right!" She snatched the ointment and yanked his collar open. "Turn around!"

When the cotton swab touched his wound, Andrew's muscles stiffened. Susan softened her touch, noticing an old scar on his lower back—a mark from when he took a knife for her.

"Susan." He suddenly turned, his bloody hand gripping her wrist. "Let's start over."

The ointment hit the floor. She tried to pull away, but he laced their fingers together and pressed her palm to his chest. His frantic heartbeat burned through his shirt, searing her fingertips.

"Have you lost your mind? Let go!"

"About four years ago..." His Adam's apple bobbed. "If you say it, I'll believe you."

Susan's pupils contracted. She had waited four years for those words—waited until her heart turned to ash, until... she no longer dared to believe.

"Too late." She laughed coldly. "Andrew, your trust... means nothing to me now."

Before she could finish, the world spun. He pinned her to the couch, his kiss tasting of blood. It was fierce, as if making up for four years of absence.

"But I care." He panted against her forehead. "Susan, goddammit... I still care."

Thunder cracked outside. As she stared into his red-rimmed eyes, Susan remembered that stormy night. Some people, it seemed, couldn't even be hated completely.
###Chapter 206: The Paternity Test Results Are In!

Susan's vision suddenly blurred.

She pressed her lips together, her fingertips trembling slightly.

A quiet sigh echoed in her heart.

Too late.

Andrew, everything is too late.

Had she heard these words before Daniel's accident, she would have thrown herself into his arms, weeping as she poured out four years of grievances and longing.

But now, Daniel was crippled.

At the cliff's edge, he had personally pushed Daniel into the abyss—for Nicole's sake.

And Bella...

Had he not deliberately made things difficult, perhaps Bella wouldn't have died so tragically.

Between them now flowed an ocean of blood and hatred.

The cruelest irony? He claimed to trust her, yet always stood by Nicole's side.

Susan's lips curled into a bitter smile. "Mr. Lucas, let's apply the medicine."

After this, they would become strangers.

Andrew's eyes darkened with fury.

Suppressing his rage, he demanded coldly, "Explain!"

Susan suddenly laughed.

The smile was breathtakingly beautiful, yet chilled to the bone.

"Explain what? That Nicole threatened me with Grandma Thompson's life?"

"Susan!" Andrew roared. "You're still slandering Nicole!"

"See? You never believed me." Her eyes were hollow. "Daniel said he no longer has a father."

Andrew grabbed her shoulders violently.

But his fingers trembled when he saw the lifelessness in her eyes.

"Daniel... is really my child?"

Susan turned away. "His father is dead."

A sudden chill ran through Andrew's body.

If Daniel was truly his son...

Then he had personally pushed his own child off a cliff, crippling him.

The thought nearly brought him to his knees.

"Susan, I—"

"Get out!" Her voice was hoarse. "Stop hurting Daniel!"

Andrew staggered out of the room.

In the hallway, he lit a cigarette, then crushed it violently.

"Leo, I need a paternity test."

Leo nearly choked on the other end. "Boss, you have a love child?"

"I want the results by tomorrow morning!"

Hanging up, Andrew stood by the window, sleepless the entire night.

At 5 a.m., Leo called. "The results are in."
###Chapter 207: The Bloodline Truth

Leo Miller's fingers trembled slightly as he dialed Andrew Lucas' number. The sky hadn't yet brightened at 5 AM, and he expected to hear voicemail.

The call connected on the first ring.

"The results?" Andrew's voice sounded raw, like sandpaper had scraped his throat.

Leo snapped to attention, spine rigid as a soldier's. "Boss, Daniel Almond—no, Daniel Lucas! The DNA match is 99.99%. He's definitely your biological son!"

A glass shattered on the other end of the line.

"I supervised the entire testing process. No mistakes." Leo added urgently, "Should I deliver the report now?"

Andrew's breathing grew heavy through the receiver. Memories flashed—calling the child a "bastard," Susan Thompson kneeling in the rain, begging him to save Daniel.

Each recollection cut deeper than a blade.

"Don't tell my parents yet." Andrew's voice shook. "I'll bring them home myself."

After hanging up, Andrew staggered to the floor-to-ceiling window. Dawn broke through the clouds, yet darkness clouded his vision. The damage was bone-deep. How could he possibly make amends?

He grabbed his car keys and rushed out, but hesitated after starting the engine. Fear of facing them paralyzed him.

Finally, he turned the wheel toward Benjamin Nash's residence.

——

In the old district's small square, morning mist lingered. Nannies chatted on benches, occasionally glancing at the playing children.

Daniel gripped the railing, practicing walking. His thin face, gaunt after the fall, was tense with concentration. Each step required visible effort.

"Look at the cripple!" A chubby boy suddenly pointed and laughed. "Walks like Donald Duck!"

Five children formed a circle, exaggeratedly mimicking Daniel's gait. One deliberately bumped his shoulder. Daniel swayed but clung to the railing.

"My mom says lameness is contagious!" A girl with pigtails shrieked, scrambling back.

Daniel pressed his lips together, eyelashes fluttering. He remembered his mother's swollen eyes and slowly unclenched his fists.

No crying. Crying would make Mom sad.

Andrew stood behind a plane tree, knuckles whitening. This bullied child who refused to fight back shared his blood.

Then he saw it—the profile unmistakably bearing the Lucas family features.
###Chapter 208: A Father's Love

"No way!"

Little Nina proudly lifted her chin, her pink princess dress shimmering in the sunlight. She stomped her foot hard, as if trying to crush the terrifying idea of "marrying a cripple."

"Mommy says cripples are useless trash!" She pouted, glaring at Daniel. "I'm going to marry a prince on a white horse!"

Tommy immediately burst into exaggerated laughter, slapping his thigh. "Trash cripple! Trash cripple!"

The three boys, as if discovering a new toy, began mimicking Daniel's limping walk. Timmy seized the moment to stick out his foot, tripping Daniel.

Daniel fell hard, scraping his knees. He bit his lip fiercely, but tears spilled out uncontrollably.

"Look, the cripple's crying!" Timmy puffed out his chest triumphantly. "Afraid no one will want you?"

Harsh laughter echoed across the playground. Daniel curled into himself like a wounded animal.

Andrew Lucas stood nearby, his heart clenched by an invisible fist. The taunts stabbed at him like knives—he was the one who had pushed his son into this torment.

Daniel had delicate features, inheriting the best of both parents. Yet now, all anyone saw were his trembling legs.

Andrew strode forward and crouched to help his son up. But Daniel flinched away as if burned, his small face twisted with humiliation.

The nanny rushed over to scoop Daniel up. The little boy struggled to walk on his own but fell again with a heavy thud.

"Stupid cripple fell again!" Timmy doubled over with laughter. "Anyone who marries him is doomed!"

Nina turned her face away in disgust. "I'd never like a cripple!"

Daniel lay on the ground, his tiny shoulders shaking. The rejection from his peers made the three-year-old experience shame for the first time.

Then, a pair of warm hands lifted him up.

Daniel froze. It was the first time his father had ever held him. The familiar scent of cologne enveloped him, making him reluctant to struggle.

"What's one plus one?" Andrew suddenly asked, his sharp gaze fixed on Timmy.

Timmy stammered, unable to answer, then pointed at Daniel angrily. "He doesn't know either!"

"Two," Daniel whispered.

The corner of Andrew's mouth lifted slightly. "Fifteen plus one hundred?"

"One hundred fifteen."

As the questions grew harder, Timmy's face turned red, while Daniel answered effortlessly. The other children gaped in surprise.

Nina suddenly ran over, offering her handkerchief. "Daniel, you're so smart!"

Timmy protested loudly. "I thought you hated cripples!"

Andrew held his son tighter. Looking down at Daniel's reddened eyes, something in his heart softened.
###Chapter 209: Nicole, It's Over

"Yes, I don't like cripples!" Jenny declared shamelessly.

She shot a disdainful glance at chubby Timmy, her eyes filled with contempt. "Bad legs can be fixed, but stupidity is incurable!"

"Timmy, you big idiot!" Jenny stuck out her tongue at him. "You can't even add one plus one, yet you dare mock Daniel? I'll tell Lily how dumb you are!"

Timmy burst into loud sobs at the mention of Lily—the little girl he adored.

Watching his dramatic tears, Jenny only grew more disgusted.

She turned to Daniel, her eyes sparkling. "Daniel, I'm sorry. I was wrong earlier. You're so good at math—can you teach me? I always get it wrong."

Daniel froze. This was the first time another child had asked to play with him.

"Okay," he whispered in reply.

Jenny happily hooked her pinky with his, solemnly chanting, "Pinky promise, a hundred years, no breaking!"

As she left, Jenny leaned close to Daniel's ear and whispered, "Daniel, your dad is so handsome!"

Daniel couldn't help stealing a glance at Andrew Lucas.

He knew the man was impressive, but that man had never liked him. The thought dimmed the light in Daniel's eyes.

The nanny recognized Andrew and hurried forward to take Daniel.

But Andrew only held him tighter, continuing toward Benjamin Nash's courtyard.

Just before reaching the door, Andrew suddenly spoke. "Daniel, I'm sorry."

Daniel's head snapped up, disbelief in his eyes.

Seeing his shock, Andrew gave a self-deprecating smile. "I know I don't deserve your forgiveness, but I'll spend my life making it up to you and your mom."

"Daniel," he took a deep breath, "I'm your father."

Daniel's eyes widened. He pinched himself secretly. It hurt—this wasn't a dream.

The nanny gasped. She needed to warn Benjamin immediately—no more matchmaking between Alexander Grant and Susan Thompson!

"W-what did you say?" Daniel's voice trembled.

"I'm your father." Andrew pulled him closer. "I'll never let you or your mother suffer again."

Daniel's nose stung. He should've defiantly rejected this terrible father, but tears betrayed him instead.

He had wanted a dad for so long.

"You... don't hate me anymore?" he asked cautiously.

Andrew's eyes burned. This child was so kind, yet all he'd given him was pain.

"You're a good boy." He awkwardly ruffled Daniel's hair.

Tears welled in Daniel's eyes. Finally, he could experience what other kids did—a father's affectionate touch.

"Can you... stop hurting Mom?"

"I'll protect her," Andrew vowed firmly.

Daniel gathered his courage. "Then... can I call you Dad?"

Andrew's chest tightened. His own child, so hesitant to say that simple word.

"Dad..." The tentative whisper escaped before Daniel suddenly tensed. "But aren't you getting married?"

"I won't marry anyone else," Andrew stated decisively. "If I marry, it'll only be your mother."

Daniel finally broke into a radiant smile.

Father and son reached an unspoken agreement: Andrew would handle Nicole Capra, while Daniel would help win back Mom.

No sooner had they left Benjamin's home than Nicole's call came.

She had made pastries and was waiting at Seaview Bay.

Perfect timing to end things. Andrew drove straight there.

The moment he entered, Nicole greeted him with a bright smile. "Andrew, try my new durian puffs—"

Andrew avoided her hand. "Nicole, it's over."
###Chapter 210: How Cruel He Was!

Nicole's pupils constricted violently.

Her gaze locked onto Andrew's thin lips as if they had just uttered the most venomous curse in the world.

"Andrew..." Her voice trembled uncontrollably. "Say that again?"

Andrew repeated emotionlessly: "We're breaking up."

Those four words stabbed into Nicole's heart like four sharp daggers.

Her nails dug deep into her palms, yet she felt no pain.

"Why?" She suddenly lunged forward and grabbed Andrew's sleeve. "We love each other so much!"

Andrew gently brushed her hand away.

"I love Susan Thompson."

Those words shattered Nicole completely. She staggered backward, knocking over a vase on the coffee table.

The sound of shattering glass mirrored the state of her heart.

"You're lying!" She screamed hysterically. "You promised to love me forever!"

Andrew's eyes darkened.

"Daniel is my son." His voice turned grave. "Four years ago, I misunderstood Susan."

Nicole's face drained of color instantly.

A paternity test!

He had secretly done a paternity test!

"No..." She shook her head frantically. "That child was aborted long ago! Susan is lying to you!"

Andrew's gaze turned icy.

"Enough." He turned to leave.

Nicole threw herself at him, clinging to his back.

"Andrew..." She wept pitifully. "I carried your child too! If not for Susan—"

"Don't mention that child." Andrew whirled around abruptly. "Nicole Capra, do you really think I know nothing?"

Nicole froze completely.

"I—" Her tears seemed to solidify on her cheeks.

Andrew's stare made her blood run cold.

"We're done." He stated decisively. "This is a notice, not a discussion."

Suddenly, Nicole laughed.

The twisted smile on her face was terrifying.

"Fine." She wiped away her tears. "But I have one condition."

Her nails dug deeper into her palms, blood dripping onto the carpet.

Andrew walked toward the door without looking back.

"Speak."

Nicole stared at his retreating figure, madness flashing in her eyes.

"I want you..."

Her voice was as soft as a serpent's hiss.

"...to watch Susan Thompson die with your own eyes."
###Chapter 211: Bella Quinn Returns!

Andrew Lucas halted mid-step, brows furrowing. "Speak."

Guilt still gnawed at him regarding Nicole Capra. Compensation after their breakup was inevitable. Had she asked, he'd have given her everything.

"Andy..." Nicole's voice trembled, tears glistening. "Give me a child."

Her fingers whitened around his sleeve. "I'll never love anyone else. Without you... at least let me have this reminder."

"A child would keep me company... so I won't die alone." She lifted tear-streaked eyes. "I swear I'll leave after the birth, never disturbing you or Susan again."

"For the kidney I gave you..." She suddenly knelt. "Grant me this last warmth."

Andrew's pupils contracted violently.

He bent to lift her, but sidestepped when she lunged into his arms.

"Nicole, don't." His voice turned arctic. "Name any other price."

"But I only want your child!" Nicole tore at her collar hysterically. "Just once... Andy..."

Andrew seized her wrist with bruising force.

"Enough." He flung her hand away, gaze sharp as shattered glass. "My debt ends here."

"Susan is my only eternity."

His retreating footsteps echoed with finality.

Nicole crumpled, mascara bleeding into grotesque streaks. Trembling fingers dialed a memorized number.

"Henry..." Her voice rasped like sandpaper. "He rejected me..."

Glass shattered on the other end.

"Don't cry, Nicole!" Henry's voice strained. "Andrew's blind! I'll—"

"Silence!" Nicole's shriek cut him off. "Who permitted you to slander him?"

She wiped her face, eyes glinting dangerously. "Daniel Almond's parentage leaked... They did a DNA test."

"What?!" Henry gasped. "Then we—"

"Panic later." Nicole's laugh chilled. "He knows nothing about the kidnapping. The priority is that video—how much longer must you delay?"

"My brother's watching me..." Henry whined. "Last time he nearly broke my leg—"

"Useless!" Nicole's nails drew blood from her palms.

She suddenly lowered her voice. "Meet at the usual place tonight. As for Susan..." Her crimson lips twisted. "I'll make her beg for death."

The call ended. Nicole studied her reflection's grotesque mask, smiling slowly.

Meanwhile, Susan Thompson had just finished filming.

The deserted bus stop swallowed her in midnight silence. She hugged her coat tighter, breath fogging under streetlights.

At the apartment gates, a familiar silhouette froze her in place.

A smoke-gray down jacket fluttered in the icy wind. The figure turned, removing a face mask—

"Bella?!"
###Chapter 212: Her Face, Ruined!

The cold wind swirled dead leaves at the neighborhood entrance.

Bella Quinn tightened her down jacket, hiding behind a plane tree. Her fingers unconsciously twisted the fabric as she stared at the apartment building exit.

Susan Thompson froze mid-step when she emerged carrying shopping bags.

She spotted the familiar figure behind the tree.

Tears instantly spilled from her eyes.

"Bella?"

Susan couldn't believe what she saw. Countless nights she'd dreamed of Bella smiling at her by the sea, only to wake to an empty pillow.

Her nails dug into her palms. The pain confirmed this wasn't a dream.

"Bella!" She stumbled forward.

The figure flinched, hastily covering her face to leave.

Susan grabbed her wrist.

"It's really you!" Susan's fingers trembled. "I knew you were alive!"

The body beneath the jacket felt frighteningly thin. Bella kept her head down, red-rimmed eyes visible above the mask.

"Susan..." She finally choked out, embracing her friend. "I'm back."

They clung to each other in the bitter wind.

"Where have you been? Why are you so thin?" Susan cupped Bella's face, noticing her evasive gaze.

Bella adjusted her mask edge. "Fishermen saved me. Susan, I divorced Simon Finch."

She forced a light laugh. "He's hospitalized now. Finally came to his senses."

Susan noticed her white-knuckled grip on the mask straps.

"Let me see your face." Susan reached suddenly.

Bella jerked back—too late.

As the mask slipped, Susan gasped.

Two grotesque scars crisscrossed her face like hideous centipedes.

"Who did this?!" Susan's voice shook. "Was it Michelle Thompson and Nicole Capra?"

Bella lowered her lashes, shadows falling across the scars.

"It's over." She whispered. "At least I survived."

Susan bit her lip hard to stifle sobs. She remembered Bella's former beauty—those crescent-moon eyes when she smiled.

"They'll pay." Susan enunciated each word.

Bella shook her head. "I'm fine now. Have work, a place—"

"Come home." Susan interrupted. "Daniel asks about you daily."

At Daniel's mention, Bella's eyes flickered before dimming. "Looking like this—"

"You'll always be our Bella." Susan gripped her hands.

Suddenly, an enraged voice exploded:

"Bella Quinn! You're alive after all!"

Bruce Bowman stormed over, eyes blazing. "Michelle enters the hospital and you appear—your doing?"

Susan shielded Bella. "Get lost!"

Bruce's gaze landed on Bella's face. His pupils contracted violently.

The face that once captivated him now bore horrific scars.
###Chapter 213: Susan, I Loved Our Daughter

Bruce Bowman appeared at the alley entrance like a phantom.

Bella Quinn barely processed his words before his bloodshot eyes locked onto her. "Bella Quinn, why did you hurt Michelle? Why force her to take that abortion pill?"

His voice dripped with ice.

Bruce clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white. He hadn't slept for a month, yet now that she stood before him, he wanted to strangle her with his bare hands.

"Bruce, have you lost your mind?" Bella sneered. "You're the one who killed my baby!"

"You bitch!" Bruce grabbed her throat. "Michelle lost her child. You'll pay with your life!"

"Bruce, let her go!" Susan Thompson rushed forward, only to be shoved violently to the ground.

Bella's eyes reddened with panic. "Susan, run!"

"Susan, get out of my way!" Bruce's gaze turned murderous. "No one's saving her today."

He forced Bella into the black sedan, which sped away with a screech.

Susan staggered to her feet, her ankle throbbing. She needed to call the police immediately.

At her apartment entrance, Andrew Lucas leaned against the doorframe.

"Move." Susan coldly pulled out her keys.

"Susan..." Andrew's voice softened unexpectedly. "I saw Daniel today."

Her fingers trembled.

"He called me Dad." Emotion flickered in Andrew's eyes. "He said he wants our family together again."

"Impossible!" Susan jerked her head up. "Daniel would never say that!"

Andrew suddenly seized her hand. "Susan, let's start over."

"Start over?" She laughed bitterly. "Does a man who killed his own child deserve that?"

Andrew's face darkened. "What?"

"You told the doctor to abort my baby!" Susan's voice shook. "Nicole Capra admitted it. You... fed our daughter to dogs..."

"Lies!" Andrew pulled her into a crushing embrace. "I would never harm our child. After your accident, the baby... couldn't be saved..."

His voice broke. "Susan, I loved our daughter."
###Chapter 214: Forced Abortion Potion

"It wasn't me, Susan!"

Andrew Lucas' forehead glistened with cold sweat as he desperately gripped Susan Thompson's wrist.

He raised three fingers in solemn oath. "If I harmed our daughter, may lightning strike me dead."

Susan wrenched her hand free.

She believed him. Andrew had always owned his actions, never denying what he'd done.

But the wounds ran too deep.

"It doesn't matter anymore, Mr. Lucas." She pulled out her phone. "Move. I'm calling the police."

"Bella Quinn?" Andrew's pupils constricted. "What happened to her?"

Susan bit her lip. "Bruce Bowman took her."

Andrew immediately dialed a number. "Locate Michelle Thompson's hospital."

Ten minutes later, the tracker pinpointed Johnson Private Hospital.

Inside the VIP suite, Michelle Thompson lay weakly against the pillows.

When Bruce dragged Bella in, Michelle suddenly convulsed violently.

"Stay away... please spare my baby..."

Bella sneered. "Enough theatrics, Michelle."

"Bella..." Tears streamed down Michelle's face. "I'm already crippled. Why won't you stop tormenting me?"

"Shut up!" Bella snapped. "You framed me for rape, scarred my face, and now blame me for your miscarriage?"

Bruce suddenly choked her. "Michelle saved me during the earthquake!"

Bella laughed bitterly. "You're blind in every way, Bruce."

Two black-suited bodyguards entered carrying a bowl the size of a coconut.

"Since you enjoy force-feeding medicine," Bruce released her, "today you'll drink your fill."

Bella turned to flee but was brutally forced into a chair.

"Let go!" She struggled wildly. "I didn't harm her!"

Bitter liquid poured down her throat, the burning pain darkening her vision.

Bruce watched coldly. "Last chance. Confess."

Bella spat out bloodied dregs, her lips curling in mockery.

"Confess to your fabricated crime? Never."
###Chapter 215: The Blood Debt Must Be Paid

Bella Quinn bit her lower lip so hard that blood trickled down her chin.

"Bruce Bowman, you're blind!" Her voice was hoarse and broken. "I swear to heaven, I never harmed Michelle Thompson!"

The last trace of warmth in Bruce's eyes froze over.

"Force the medicine down her throat," he commanded, each word dripping with ice.

Scalding liquid poured into Bella's mouth as she struggled violently against the hands pinning her down. The potion burned her esophagus, making every breath taste like blood.

After twenty minutes of torture, she curled into a fetal position on the floor, writhing from excruciating abdominal pain.

Bruce's phone vibrated. He glanced at the screen and strode out of the hospital room.

"Your grandmother is dead," Michelle suddenly sat up, smiling like a venomous serpent. "We stopped her medication three days ago. By now, her corpse must be rotting."

Bella's blood turned to ice.

"The nurse said she kept calling for you before she died," Michelle tilted her head mockingly. "Pity she couldn't even have her ashes sent home."

Each word stabbed through Bella's heart like a dagger.

The grandmother who used to pat her head and say "My sweet Bella" was gone forever.

"Want to know how she spent her final days?" Michelle whispered in her ear. "I fired the nurse and left her alone in bed to die."

Bella's vision flooded crimson.

She lunged forward, grabbing Michelle's hair and slamming her head against the wall.

"Die, you bitch!"

A stainless steel cup smashed against Michelle's forehead, blood immediately gushing out.

"Bruce! Help!" Michelle shrieked.

Bruce burst through the door to find Michelle's face covered in blood.

"Bella Quinn!" He seized her throat and threw her across the room.

Bella crashed onto the floor, ribs cracking from the impact.

"Chop off both her hands," Bruce ordered, his voice colder than a death sentence.

A blade flashed through the air—only to be caught mid-swing by a pair of strong, elegant fingers.

Warm blood dripped onto Bella's face, metallic and sweet.

###Chapter 216: Andrew Lucas Protects His Wife

Bella Quinn curled up on the floor, immobilized by the sharp pain in her abdomen.

Bruce Bowman's bodyguard advanced with a knife, its blade glinting coldly under the light.

Just as the knife descended, a figure lunged forward and caught the blade barehanded.

Blood dripped from Calvin Grant's palm, blooming like crimson petals on the ground.

"Mr. Grant!" Bella gasped.

Bruce narrowed his eyes, his voice icy. "Calvin, what's the meaning of this?"

Calvin flung the bloodied blade aside, his gaze burning. "Bruce, bullying a woman? Pathetic."

The bodyguards recoiled in shock. No one expected the Grant heir to get hurt.

Kneeling on one knee, Calvin gently helped Bella up. His eyes darkened at the sight of her bruised face.

"Does it hurt?" he asked softly.

Bella froze. No one had asked her that since Bruce abandoned her.

Tears spilled uncontrollably.

Watching this, Bruce's chest tightened inexplicably. He clenched his fists. "Calvin, stay out of this!"

"Out of this?" Calvin scoffed. "Bruce, just because you're blind and heartless doesn't mean everyone else is."

He turned to Michelle Thompson, his stare piercing. "Miss Thompson, are you sure you had a miscarriage?"

Michelle paled, clutching her stomach with a whimper. "Bruce, it hurts..."

"Nice act." Susan Thompson strode in, followed by Andrew Lucas. "Michelle, you were never pregnant."

Michelle's eyes flickered with panic. "Susan, how could you slander me like this?"

"Slander?" Susan smirked. "Medical reports don't lie."

Bruce shielded Michelle in his arms. "Susan, you've gone too far!"

Andrew stepped forward, pulling Susan behind him. "Bruce, think carefully before raising your voice at my wife."

Michelle gritted her teeth. She hadn't expected Andrew to side with Susan.

"Andrew," Bruce growled, his face stormy. "This isn't over."

Andrew's lips curved into a smile that lit up the room. "Good. I wasn't planning to let it slide either."

He snapped his fingers. "Bring them in."

Footsteps echoed outside. The truth was about to be revealed.

###Chapter 217: She's Filthy and Shameless

The hospital door burst open.

Two doctors in white coats strode in, thick medical files in hand.

Michelle Thompson's face drained of color. Her nails dug into Bruce Bowman's sleeve. "Bruce, make them leave!" Her voice rose to a shrill pitch. "They're here to hurt me!"

Bruce instinctively shielded her, but froze at Andrew Lucas's icy tone.

"Explain. Was Michelle ever pregnant?"

The lead doctor glanced at Michelle, trembling under her threatening glare. But offending the third young master of the Lucas family was far worse.

"Miss Thompson... was never pregnant!"

The second doctor added hastily, "We lied about her miscarriage for money!"

Bruce's expression darkened. "Say that again."

Trembling, the doctors chorused, "Mr. Bowman, Miss Thompson never conceived!"

"Lies!" Michelle shrieked hysterically. "I don't even know you! Bella Quinn must have paid you off!"

She threw herself against Bruce, tears soaking his shirt. "Bruce, believe me... I just lost our baby, and now they're tormenting me..."

A doctor handed over a phone with shaking hands. "Mr. Bowman, these are Miss Thompson's transfer records."

Bruce stared at the familiar bank account digits, his knuckles whitening.

Another doctor flipped open a file. "Her medical report clearly shows—"

"Shut up!" Michelle suddenly went still, lifting her tear-streaked face. "Bruce, records can be faked..."

Bruce gently stroked her back, but his voice turned cold. "Michelle, these records are real."

She stiffened.

Never had she seen this look in his eyes—no longer tender adoration, but bone-chilling detachment.

"I... I admit it." She broke down sobbing. "But I was scared! Terrified you'd go back to Bella!"

Bruce held her silently. "Silly girl, I only want you."

"That woman..." He sneered. "Just looking at her disgusts me."

Before he finished, Calvin Grant's fist smashed into his face.

"You're the ones who should be apologizing, you cheating scum!"
###Chapter 218: I'll Watch You Drown in Regret

"Bruce..."

Bruce Bowman gently stroked Michelle Thompson's hair, his voice low and firm. "Don't be afraid. I'm here."

His sharp gaze cut toward Calvin Grant like a blade. "Even if Michelle made a mistake, that bitch Bella Quinn had no right to lay a hand on her. She deserves to die!"

"Give my grandmother back to me!"

Bella clutched her agonizing stomach, sweat soaking the strands of hair clinging to her forehead. She bit her lower lip hard, stubbornly straightening her spine.

"You killed her! Give her back!"

Bruce frowned slightly. He had indeed handed Bella's grandmother over to Michelle, but he hadn't expected things to go this far.

"Michelle..."

Michelle nibbled her lip, her voice soft. "Bruce, I forgot to tell you... Bella's grandmother passed away three days ago from a sudden heart attack. We tried everything to save her, but..."

"You're lying!" Bella trembled violently. "You cut off her medication! Give her back to me!"

A sharp pain tore through her, warm liquid trickling down her thighs. Bella's vision darkened, her knees buckling.

"Bella!"

Susan Thompson moved to rush forward, but Calvin was faster. He caught Bella just as she collapsed, pulling her tightly against him.

Only then did the others notice the blood soaking through the hem of Bella's down jacket.

"What did you do to her?!" Susan's fury erupted as she slapped Bruce across the face.

Bruce's expression darkened, murder flashing in his eyes.

"Susan!"

Andrew Lucas's fist struck faster, slamming into Bruce's jaw. "I warned you not to touch my woman."

"It's an abortifacient," the doctor murmured after examining the residue in the bowl.

"What?!" Susan's pupils constricted. That massive dose could have killed her.

Calvin's face turned ashen. Ignoring his own bleeding hand, he scooped Bella into his arms and bolted for the door.

Susan chased after them, whirling back at the threshold. "Bruce Bowman, you'll regret this! One day, I'll watch you drown in remorse, wishing you were dead!"

Without another glance, she sprinted after Calvin.

Bruce stood frozen, the sting on his cheek nothing compared to the inexplicable ache in his chest.

Regret?

That vile woman got what she deserved. He would never regret this.

After emergency treatment, Bella stabilized. Her body would heal, but the wounds in her heart never would.

Her grandmother was gone forever.

Susan wanted to stay, but Andrew teased her about being a third wheel. Seeing Calvin's grip on Bella's hand, she finally left.

Outside the hospital, Susan headed to her apartment to pack, planning to move in with Daniel and Bella.

To her surprise, Andrew clung to her like glue.

"Susan, did I look cool back there?" His grin was boyish, a stark contrast to his usual brooding demeanor.

For a moment, she was transported back to their youth, when he'd ask her the same thing after fights.

"Thanks," she replied coldly.

"Susan!" Andrew wrapped his arms around her from behind. "Give me another chance. Let's remarry. I swear I'll treat you right."

"Mr. Lucas, what about Nicole Capra?" Susan struggled futilely. "To me, you'll always be her man!"

"We broke up." Andrew turned her to face him, his gaze intense. "There's only you in my heart. Susan, I love you."

The words sent a tremor through her.

Seizing the advantage, Andrew pressed on. "I can heal Bella's scars. Kiss me, and I'll help you."
###Chapter 219: His Tender Trap

Susan Thompson knew Andrew Lucas wasn't joking.

Bella Quinn's facial scars would never fully heal. Even the best plastic surgeon couldn't guarantee results.

Victoria Lucas's scar removal ointment had been a medical miracle, but the rare ingredients and complex formula made it impossible to find now.

"Susan," Andrew's voice was low and tempting, "Just one kiss, and I'll deliver the ointment tomorrow."

She was about to refuse when warm lips pressed against hers.

The kiss came without warning, lingering until she gasped for air. Only then did he pull back, reluctant.

"Good girl." His thumb brushed her swollen lips as he smirked like a satisfied cat. "I'll bring it myself tomorrow."

Susan's cheeks burned with anger.

The man was shameless! He'd forced the kiss yet made it sound like she'd thrown herself at him.

Four years ago, he'd been the same—cold and aloof in public, but a hungry wolf in private, pouncing at every chance.

The memories made her ears flush crimson.

She turned away, hiding her embarrassment.

Andrew noticed the pink tips of her ears anyway, his smile deepening. His Susan still blushed so easily. Even her anger made him ache for her.

"Tomorrow." He bid farewell like a gentleman, but pinched her waist as he left.

The moment Susan stepped inside, Daniel called.

"Mom, I saw Dad today." His voice was hesitant. "I... called him Dad. Are you mad?"

Her heart clenched.

"Daniel, you hated him."

"I did." He paused. "But I want a dad. Mom, can we give him a chance? Like you said—everyone deserves forgiveness if they change."

Her hand trembled around the phone.

The past wounds were still raw, but she couldn't crush Daniel's hope.

"Let me think about it, okay? I'll tell you tomorrow."

After hanging up, she tossed in bed, sleepless.

Andrew was like an inescapable net, closing in on her. But could betrayal and pain really be erased?

Frustrated, she scrolled through her phone—then froze.

After King's Glory announced her as their ambassador, backlash had flooded social media. But tonight, the outrage had taken a darker turn.

She was now being branded a "traitor."

Susan stared at the screen, her fingers turning ice-cold.
###Chapter 220: The Traitor's Label

Comments flooded Susan Thompson's phone screen like a tidal wave.

Her finger froze mid-air.

The words stung her eyes.

"Traitor" stood out like a brand searing into her heart.

She tapped the trending topic and finally understood the source of the storm.

The costume stills mistaken for a kimono now topped the hot search list.

The comment section had exploded.

"Can't Hua Nation find anyone better than a traitor to play Diao Chan?"

"Disgusting! Wearing enemy attire to portray a historical figure!"

"Get out of the entertainment industry!"

Susan's fingertips trembled slightly.

She knew better than anyone—this was a meticulously recreated Han costume.

But no one wanted explanations now.

Public opinion had become a runaway horse, galloping toward chaos.

Then an interview video suddenly went viral.

Candy Wilson appeared on screen in a white dress, tearfully saying, "Susan... always had a thing for R Nation's culture." She hesitated. "Her ex was from R Nation. Maybe that influenced her..."

The words became a spark in a powder keg.

Comments erupted instantly.

"So she's been a traitor all along!"

"Ban her permanently!"

"May her whole family die horribly!"

Susan's gaze turned icy at the last comment.

She could endure insults—but never curses against her family.

The computer's blue light reflected on her face.

She opened a long-buried webpage—a five-year-old tabloid report from R Nation.

The photo showed Candy wrapped in R Nation's flag, beaming.

Susan clicked send.

"Miss Wilson," she murmured to the empty room, "hope you enjoy this gift."

The hurricane of public opinion was about to change course.
###Chapter 221: The Fall from Grace

Candy Wilson's schedule was packed tonight.

First, she attended a luxury brand's gala. Then she rushed to South Lake TV station for a live speech program.

Her prepared speech was about her Cinderella story—how she rose from obscurity to marry into wealth. But her agent noticed her recent patriotic posts had gone viral.

The team held an emergency meeting. They decided to change the topic last minute.

"Patriotism" was always a safe bet in showbiz.

Under the spotlight, Candy wore a white dress with flawless makeup. She delivered an emotional speech about loving her country. At the climax, she choked up with tears.

"I'll never forget the first time I saw our national flag rising..."

The audience was moved. Applause filled the room.

Live chat comments flooded the screen:

"A true national goddess!"

"Much better than that foreign-loving Susan Thompson!"

Candy bowed gracefully, ready to exit. Suddenly, a young man in black-framed glasses rushed onstage.

Security moved to stop him, but Candy waved them off with a gentle smile. "Let him speak."

Her expression was encouraging.

"Miss Wilson, you claim to love your country?" The man's voice trembled.

"Of course." She tilted her head, flashing her signature sweet smile. "It's in my blood."

He suddenly raised his phone. A faded photo appeared on screen.

"Then explain this."

The photo showed a younger Candy wrapped in a foreign flag, fawning over a foreign man.

Her smile froze.

Her mind went blank. This was from her early career—a desperate attempt to please a wealthy foreigner. She thought it would never surface.

"This...this is photoshopped!" Her voice shook.

"Foreign media reported it extensively back then." The man smirked. "You wore their flag and publicly renounced your citizenship!"

The live feed zoomed in on the photo.

The crowd erupted.

Candy's legs weakened. Her carefully crafted image crumbled instantly.

Worse—she realized Vincent King might see this.

"Security! Stop him!" Her agent screamed, rushing onstage.

But it was too late.

Viewership skyrocketed. Comments exploded:

"Liar!"

"Traitorous gold-digger!"

"Does Vincent know how dirty you are?"

Staff shielded Candy as she fled. Outside, a shadow lunged at her.

"Die, traitor!"

A bucket of foul liquid drenched her.

She stood frozen, soaked, the stench making her gag.

Camera flashes lit up the scene.

She knew—it was over.
###Chapter 222: Andrew Lucas Personally Seeks Justice for Susan!

Candy Wilson froze on the spot.

The pungent stench made her gag.

Vincent King stood nearby, his tailored suit immaculate, his handsome features godlike. Candy's eyes welled up as tears cascaded down her cheeks.

"Vincent..."

Sobbing pitifully, she stumbled toward him.

The assistants exchanged uneasy glances, none daring to approach. The smell was suffocating. They silently signaled security to apprehend the manure-throwing culprit.

Vincent's brow furrowed slightly.

When Candy lunged at him, covered in filth, he instinctively sidestepped.

"Ah!"

Her feet slipped, sending her crashing onto the pavement. Her meticulously styled hair was now matted with waste, her expensive gown ruined beyond repair.

"Vincent, it hurts..."

She lifted her face, attempting her usual pitiful expression. But smeared with grime, she only looked ridiculous.

Vincent's outstretched hand paused midair.

"Roger."

He summoned his assistant with a low command, stepping back another two paces.

Suddenly, camera flashes erupted.

"Miss Wilson, any response to the R-country reports?"

"Does Mr. King know about your past with the tycoon?"

Reporters swarmed, lenses trained on the disheveled Candy.

"Get away! Stop filming!"

She shrieked hysterically, lunging for a camera. The journalists recoiled, protecting their expensive equipment from contamination.

Vincent's icy gaze swept the crowd.

"Leave."

A single word sent chills down their spines. Remembering his ruthless reputation, they scattered in panic.

"Vincent, I was framed..."

Tears streaming, Candy tried approaching again.

Vincent retreated impassively. "Roger will take you home."

He turned toward the opposite sidewalk, his departure final.

Roger grimaced as he opened the car door, rolling windows down completely. This vehicle was beyond salvage...

Meanwhile, Leo Miller stood trembling before Andrew Lucas.

"Boss, Alexander Grant just joined Weibo."

Andrew's eyes turned glacial.

"He posted." Leo swallowed hard. "Called Miss Thompson the most wonderful woman... and tagged her."

The air froze.

Leo's back prickled with cold sweat. Just as he braced for fury, a soft chuckle broke the tension.

"Daniel is my son."

Andrew's lips curved, triumph gleaming in his eyes.

Leo suddenly understood. With the child as leverage, victory was assured.

"Who called her a shoehorn face?" Andrew's voice turned dangerous.

Leo jumped. "Blind fools! Miss Thompson is absolutely stunning!"

The chill dissipated.

Andrew nodded approvingly. "My taste has always been impeccable."

Leo gaped. Was this really the cold-blooded Andrew Lucas?

"And Candy Wilson?"

"Proceeding as planned. Tomorrow's headlines are secured."

Andrew's slender fingers tapped the desk. "Not enough." His gaze darkened. "Take her to South Lake. Tonight, I'll personally deliver Susan's justice."
###Chapter 223: Gouge Out Candy's Eyes!

Leo's back instantly stiffened.

He stole a glance at Andrew's sinister profile, his Adam's apple bobbing involuntarily. The boss looked more terrifying tonight than the devil himself.

Strangely, he felt a thrill of excitement.

"Boss, I'll handle it immediately!" Leo straightened his posture, eyes gleaming with peculiar intensity.

Candy had just changed clothes when her phone began vibrating wildly.

It was that gangster.

"Got the money ready?" The threatening voice growled through the receiver. "Try anything funny, and I'll have a nice chat with Vincent about the bastard in your belly!"

Her fingernails dug deep into her palms.

Grabbing the prepared cash, she stumbled out of her apartment.

The night wind slapped her face just as excruciating pain exploded at the back of her neck.

Darkness swallowed all consciousness.

Blinding lights made Candy squint instinctively.

As she struggled to sit up, she met Andrew's ice-cold gaze.

"M-Mr. Lucas?" Her voice trembled uncontrollably. The man before her possessed godlike beauty, yet radiated suffocating murderous intent.

Andrew's lips curled slowly.

That smile froze the blood in her veins.

"Hel—" She yanked out her phone, only for Leo to smack it to the ground before she could dial. The shattered device mirrored her crumbling courage.

"I'm Nicole's best friend!" Candy clung to her last shred of rationality. "If you hurt me, she'll hate you forever!"

Andrew suddenly chuckled.

The sound made her hair stand on end.

"Susan's little finger," he drawled, each word a knife, "remained on the operating table because of you."

Her pupils contracted violently.

Now she understood Andrew's intention.

"No!" She scrambled backward like a madwoman, only to be hauled back by bodyguards and slammed onto the concrete floor.

When they pinned her left hand down, Candy completely broke.

"I was wrong! I swear I'll never do it again!" Snot and tears streamed down her face. "Please spare me!"

Andrew watched her hysterical display impassively.

"Did you spare Susan when she begged?"

Cold steel flashed.

A bloodcurdling scream pierced the night.

Candy lay in a pool of her own filth. But the nightmare continued—they roughly tied her to the back of a sports car.

The screech of burning rubber became her personal hell.

By the time the car stopped, she'd lost her voice.

Andrew's polished shoes entered her blurred vision.

"Daniel almost lost his eyes because of you." He crouched down, whispering like a lover. "What should I do with yours?"
###Chapter 224: Blood for Blood

"Stop..."

Candy Wilson curled up in a pool of blood, the excruciating pain from her severed fingers nearly suffocating her. She had never imagined enduring such heart-wrenching torment.

The skin on her back was already mangled, the exposed bone of her severed fingers scraping against the ground. Trembling, she lifted her blood-streaked face, tears mingling with blood as they fell.

"Andrew Lucas... please..." Her voice was hoarse, barely recognizable. "I swear... I'll never dare again..."

Andrew Lucas looked down at her with a gaze colder than steel.

"Too late."

Two words sealed her fate.

Candy's pupils contracted in terror. She watched as the bodyguard raised a gleaming dagger, its tip aimed directly at her eye.

"No—!"

A piercing scream tore through the air. Just as the blade was about to pierce her skin, a dark figure swept in like a gust of wind.

"Candy!"

A familiar scent enveloped her. Shaking, Candy forced her eyes open and met Vincent King's bloodshot gaze.

"Vincent..." she whispered weakly, tears flooding down her face.

Vincent pulled her tightly into his arms, his murderous glare locking onto Andrew. "Andrew Lucas, you're dead!"

"Such bold words, Vincent King," Andrew sneered. "Where was this righteous fury when you came after what was mine?"

"That bitch Susan—"

"Shut your mouth!" Andrew's eyes darkened dangerously. "One more insult about her, and I'll cut out your tongue!"

Vincent's chest heaved with rage. He bent down and picked up the severed finger from the ground, his own fingers trembling.

"This debt will be repaid."

In his arms, Candy suddenly convulsed, blood trickling from the corner of her mouth. Vincent could no longer delay. He carried her out and rushed toward the car.

Inside the vehicle, Candy's sobs clawed at his nerves like a dull blade.

"Vincent... it hurts so much..." she whimpered between ragged breaths. "I just... wanted to atone... why... did they have to kill me..."

Vincent's grip on the steering wheel turned his knuckles white.

In the rearview mirror, Candy's pale face was streaked with blood, her severed fingers still oozing. And all of this—because of Susan Thompson!

"Hang on, Candy," he rasped, his voice terrifyingly rough. "I'll make her... pay in blood."

A weak smile tugged at Candy's lips. She knew—from this moment on, Susan was as good as dead.
###Chapter 225: The Shameful Alexander Grant and Susan Thompson

Candy Wilson lay in the VIP hospital bed, her pinky finger wrapped in thick gauze.

Vincent King's team of specialists had just completed the surgery. Though they saved her finger, the excruciating pain kept her awake all night.

She stared at the ceiling, eyes burning with venom.

"Susan Thompson..." Candy gritted her teeth, nails digging into her palms.

She didn't dare direct her hatred toward the powerful Andrew Lucas. All her fury was reserved for Susan.

Public opinion had completely reversed.

The photo of Susan draped in a foreign flag was exposed as a forgery. Meanwhile, someone dug up old pictures of Candy cozying up to a foreign billionaire.

The official King's Glory account clarified that the outfit was authentic traditional design.

Alexander Grant personally registered on Weibo to defend Susan.

The final blow came when medical authority Victoria Lucas released archaeological findings of historical garments nearly identical to Susan's.

"This can't be happening!" Candy frantically refreshed her phone, watching the flood of insults.

"Candy the Traitor, get out of showbiz!"
"May Candy be reincarnated as a toilet brush!"
"How dare a traitor frame an innocent person?"

The most devastating was her manure-dousing video trending at number one.

Vincent used his connections to suppress the news, but the label "Candy the Traitor" stuck.

Susan's lips curled as she scrolled through her phone.

Her Weibo followers had skyrocketed to 100,000—mostly Alexander's fans attacking her for being unworthy of their idol.

Stranger still, a "South-Tang Couple" fan group emerged.

A novel titled The Domineering CEO Spoils His Internet Celebrity Wife was climbing the charts.

Curious, Susan clicked—then flushed crimson.

"This...this is too..." She fumbled to close the tab.

The first chapter featured explicit bedroom scenes with a cliché plot: the heroine gets sent to the wrong room and spends the night with Alexander.

Ding-dong—

The doorbell rang.

Through the peephole, Alexander's tall frame stood outside.

Susan took a deep breath, reaching for the knob—

Ding. The elevator doors slid open.

Andrew stepped out holding Daniel's hand, his gaze instantly locking onto Alexander.

A phone shrilled abruptly.

"Boss!" Leo Miller's panicked voice crackled. "There's a story online about Ms. Thompson and Alexander Grant...they...they..."

Andrew's face darkened like storm clouds.
###Chapter 226: The Rivalry Between Andrew Lucas and Alexander Grant

"What did you say?!" Andrew's knuckles turned white, his grip on the phone threatening to shatter the screen. "Say that again!"

Even through the phone, Leo could feel the icy rage. His voice trembled. "Boss... you should check online yourself..."

Andrew ended the call abruptly. Holding a shopping bag in one hand and Daniel's small hand in the other, he strode into the apartment.

He dropped onto the couch, his long fingers swiping rapidly across his phone screen.

Susan watched the uninvited man, her temple throbbing. Was his face made of steel?

"Mr. Grant, what brings you here?" She turned to the man standing at the door.

Alexander's gaze was deep. "Aren't you going to invite me in?"

Reluctantly, Susan stepped aside. One intruder was bad enough—now there were two.

The thought of that online novel, The CEO's Obsession with His Internet Darling, made her want to hunt down the author, Nina Young, immediately.

"Old Mr. Nash asked me to tell you—dinner tomorrow night," Alexander said suddenly.

"Perfect!" Susan's eyes lit up. "I've been meaning to cook a few special dishes for him."

"Your sweet and sour ribs last time were excellent." A faint smile touched Alexander's lips. "I'll assist you tomorrow."

Andrew's head snapped up. He had just finished reading the latest chapter—where the protagonists went from cooking in the kitchen to something far more intimate.

"I'm coming too," he cut in coldly. "It's been a while since I visited Old Mr. Nash."

Susan ignored him completely, continuing her menu discussion with Alexander.

Andrew narrowed his eyes. "Susan, Daniel said he wants hot pot." He deliberately emphasized the words "family of three."

"Mr. Lucas, you're not welcome here." Her voice was like ice.

Then Daniel tugged at her sleeve. "Mom... just this once, please?"

Faced with her son's pleading eyes, Susan relented.

"Mr. Grant, you should join us too," she said pointedly.

Andrew's face darkened instantly.

Leo had prepared everything for the hot pot—even a divided pot for different broths.

Alexander slid a bowl of dipping sauce toward her.

"Susan likes it spicy," Andrew said, handing her a bowl of bright red sauce.

But she took Alexander's bowl instead. "Thanks, but I don't eat spicy anymore."

Alexander clumsily peeled a shrimp. "Try this."

Andrew's pupils constricted. He remembered exactly what happened next in that damned novel.

"I'll do it!" He snatched the plate of shrimp away.

The two men locked eyes across the table, the steam from the hot pot turning to frost between them.
###Chapter 227: Susan's Leading Man

Susan's fingers trembled slightly as she stared at the shrimp Alexander Grant had placed in her bowl.

Andrew Lucas' chopsticks suddenly intervened, precisely snatching the shrimp away. He chewed slowly, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Not bad."

With practiced elegance, he picked up another shrimp, his slender fingers deftly peeling the shell. The motion was achingly familiar—four years ago, during every date, Susan would wait eagerly for him to peel shrimp for her.

Back then, she loved to pout and gaze at him with those dewy eyes. The young master of the Lucas family had never served anyone before. But under her pleading gaze, all his principles flew out the window.

Gradually, he found joy in the act. Each time he fed her shrimp, he was rewarded with a sweet kiss. The memory of her soft lips made his throat tighten.

"Susan." He placed a shrimp dipped in spicy sauce onto her plate.

She stared blankly at it. Once a lover of all things spicy, she now recoiled at the mere scent. Coldly, she pushed the plate away. "Mr. Lucas, I don't eat spicy food anymore."

Andrew's brow furrowed. In the blink of an eye, Alexander had already peeled three shrimp and placed them in her bowl. Before Susan could react, she had swallowed them.

Andrew's face darkened instantly.

Alexander's phone suddenly rang. After the call, he buttoned his suit jacket. "I'll pick you up tomorrow for dinner at Grandfather's."

"Okay," Susan replied instinctively.

Andrew's molars ground audibly. He glared at the closed door, as if the air had suddenly cleared.

"Susan, why won't you eat spicy food anymore?" He peeled another shrimp. "Still angry with me?"

"People change." She lowered her gaze. "Just like how I once loved you, but don't anymore."

The words stabbed like a knife into his heart. But then it hit him—she had admitted to loving him once! A fire ignited in Andrew's eyes. She had given birth to Daniel for him—how could that love simply vanish?

He leaned in to kiss her, but his phone erupted with a shrill ring.

"Boss, should we blacklist that novelist?" Leo Miller's voice wavered.

"Transfer a million." Andrew's lips curled. "And change the male lead to me."

A sharp intake of breath came from the other end of the line.

Susan slammed her chopsticks down. "I refuse!"

"The leading man in your life—" Andrew yanked her into his arms, "—can only be me."

As his scorching lips descended, Daniel quickly covered his eyes. "Keep going, Mom and Dad! I can't see anything!"

Susan's ears burned red. Just as she was about to explode, her phone vibrated.

A message about Bella Quinn's accident flashed on the screen.
###Chapter 228: She Will Disappear Forever!

Bella Quinn stood at the end of the hospital corridor. Raindrops slanted against the windowpane outside.

Her grandmother's death certificate remained clutched in her hand, the paper soaked through with tears.

Calvin Grant had just left, repeatedly instructing the nurse to watch over her before departing. But she had to go. She needed to find him.

The gates of the Bowman mansion felt both familiar and foreign. The butler visibly startled upon seeing her, hesitating before finally allowing her inside.

Bruce Bowman sat in the living room, a cigarette between his slender fingers. Smoke curled around his sharp features.

"Bruce." Bella's voice came out hoarse and broken.

He lifted his gaze, eyes like poisoned daggers. "Who gave you permission to enter?"

"My grandmother is gone." Bella's nails dug into her palms. "Please... give her back to me."

Bruce crushed his cigarette into the ashtray with a cold laugh. "Did you ever consider this outcome when Michelle Thompson jumped into the sea?"

Bella trembled, silent tears streaming down her face. "Hate me all you want. But my grandmother was innocent."

"Innocent?" Bruce surged to his feet, gripping her chin. "A woman like you dares speak of innocence?"

Forced to meet his gaze, Bella saw only disgust in eyes that once held tenderness.

"I'll do anything." Her words came with difficulty. "Just tell me where she is."

Something dangerous flickered in Bruce's expression. Releasing her, he slowly unbuttoned his cuff. "Take it off."

Bella froze.

"Having second thoughts?" His lips curled mockingly. "You weren't so shy in my bed all those years ago."

The rain intensified outside as Bella's shaking fingers undid her coat buttons. The fabric fell soundlessly to the floor.

Bruce's gaze darkened. Even consumed by hatred, his body remembered her warmth.

He shoved her onto the sofa, his kiss brutal and desperate. Bella closed her eyes, tears disappearing into her hair.

"Bruce!" Michelle's shrill cry came from the staircase.

He shoved Bella away as if discarding something filthy.

Michelle stood on the landing, a kitchen knife in hand, tears streaming. "I'll give you what you want!"

The blade flashed. Bruce's face paled. "Michelle!"

Bella scrambled up, pain shooting through her ankle. She watched Bruce lunge toward Michelle, saw the knife press against that delicate throat.

"I'll disappear." Michelle sobbed pitifully. "Forever!"
###Chapter 229: You're the Only One I Want in This Lifetime

"Michelle!"

Bruce's pupils constricted as he lunged toward the staircase like a madman. The fruit knife in Michelle's hand gleamed coldly under the light, its blade already pressing a thin red line against her slender neck.

Tears streamed down her face as her voice trembled uncontrollably. "Bruce... Don't come closer... Let me die..."

"How could a cripple like me ever deserve you?"

"I don't blame you for falling for Bella... I just hate myself... for not even being able to stand..."

Bella watched the farce with cold detachment. If she truly wanted to die, why wait until Bruce arrived? Such clumsy acting, yet someone still fell for it.

"Put the knife down!" Bruce's voice shook. "I've never thought of you as a burden!"

He stepped closer, his eyes filled with anguish. "Michelle, you'll always be the one I love most. Your injury only makes me cherish you more."

Michelle wept pitifully. "Then what were you doing with Bella earlier?"

"I despise her!" Bruce declared without hesitation. "If I cared about her, why would I have married her off to Simon?"

"But they're divorced now..." The knife pressed deeper, blood trickling down the blade.

Bruce's breath hitched. "If you drop the knife, I'll send her away immediately!"

"Marry her to my brother, please?" Michelle suddenly lifted her tear-filled eyes. "They're in love..."

Bruce frowned slightly. His mind flashed to that rainy night—Hugo pinning Bella down in the rose bushes.

"You can't bear to?" Michelle's voice turned sharp.

"Of course not!" He seized her wrist holding the knife. "I'll send her over tonight!"

A faint smirk curled Michelle's lips, while Bella's face turned deathly pale.

Hugo—that demonic name sent chills down her spine. The hostess he'd beaten to death last month still lay at the bottom of the moat...
###Chapter 230: The Desperate Leap

Excruciating pain shot through Bella Quinn's ankle, yet her expression remained unflinching.

She grabbed her coat and staggered toward the exit.

"Bella!"

Bruce Bowman's voice cut through the air like ice, making her pause mid-step.

"Do you still want your grandmother's ashes returned?"

The words stabbed her heart like a dagger.

Her fists clenched until nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

After fourteen years, she finally saw the monster beneath the man she'd loved.

"I'd rather die than marry Hugo Thompson!"

She flung open the door, dragging her injured leg behind her.

"Bruce..."

Michelle Thompson's tearful voice floated down from upstairs.

Bruce's eyes darkened as he made a call.

Within moments, a dozen black-suited bodyguards blocked the villa's entrance.

"Deliver her to the Thompson residence."

"Let me go!" Bella thrashed against their grip. "You don't own me, Bruce!"

Her struggles proved futile against trained professionals.

"Stop pretending you're above this." His laugh held no warmth. "Starting tonight, you belong to Hugo."

Bella suddenly went still.

Her gaze held the detachment one reserves for strangers.

"Dead or alive..." She repeated the phrase with a bitter smile.

To him, her life held less value than weeds.

The sports car carried her toward Hugo's apartment in eerie silence.

Gold-leaf opulence couldn't mask the apartment's underlying decay.

A battered woman struggled beneath Hugo on the bed.

Spotting Bella, he kicked the woman aside.

"Get out!"

The woman fled naked, stumbling in her haste.

Bella's stomach dropped.

Her eyes darted, searching for escape routes.

Hugo's phone rang.

"Michelle?" His grin turned predatory. "Don't worry, I'll give her a proper welcome."

"Marriage? Don't be ridiculous."

"Understood..."

His reptilian stare crawled over her skin.

As he turned away, Bella lunged for the open window.

Sixteen stories promised certain death.

But anything was better than Hugo's hands.

She climbed onto the ledge without hesitation.

Night wind lifted her hair like a butterfly's broken wings.
###Chapter 231: Let's Perish Together!

"You vile, ugly bitch! How dare you try to jump? I'll kill you!"

Hugo Thompson was despicable, but his reflexes were sharp. Like a starving wolf, he lunged for the windowsill, grabbing Bella Quinn by the collar and yanking her back into the room.

Bella's ankle was already sprained, and the fall sent waves of pain through her, cold sweat beading on her skin. Before she could recover, Hugo's leather shoe slammed into her chest.

"I haven't even touched you yet, and you're already trying to die?" He sneered, dragging her by her hair toward the bed. "Tonight, I'll show you what true suffering feels like!"

"Let me go!" Bella struggled wildly, but she was no match for his brute strength. Her resistance only enraged him further. A vicious slap struck her face, making the scar beneath his hand appear even more grotesque.

"You still think you're the Bowman family's precious daughter? You're nothing but a disgusting freak now!" Hugo spat. "I'm doing you a favor by touching you!"

"You're worse than a freak!" Bella laughed coldly. "You're a sick, twisted animal!"

"What did you say?!" His eyes bulged with rage, and another slap cracked across her face. "Say it again!"

"I said you're a coward who only dares to hurt women!" She spat blood onto the floor. "A waste of life like you deserves to be despised by every woman alive!"

Hugo's eyes darkened with fury. He wrapped his hands around Bella's throat and slammed her repeatedly against the wall. The pain blurred her vision, but it only hardened her resolve.

When he threw her onto the bed again, she seized the lamp from the nightstand and smashed it against his head. Glass shards exploded, blood immediately gushing from his forehead.

"You bitch!" He wiped the blood from his face and lunged at her like a wounded beast. Bella grabbed the vanity stool and swung it hard into his back. As he staggered, she bolted for the door.

"Trying to run?" Hugo seized her hair and hurled her onto the broken glass. Sharp fragments pierced her back, the pain so intense her vision went black. A pool of blood spread beneath her.

Hugo tore open his shirt buttons, sneering down at her. "Now you understand what happens when you cross me?"

As he leaned in, Bella summoned every ounce of strength left and drove her knee upward. Hugo howled, doubling over in agony, his face ghostly pale.

"You're dead!" Once he recovered, he threw her onto the bed in a blind rage. Blood loss made Bella's vision swim, but she bit her lip hard, clinging to consciousness.

When Hugo pinned her down, she squeezed her eyes shut in despair. Images flashed through her mind—her grandmother's kind smile, Susan Thompson's warm hands, little Daniel's innocent eyes, and... Calvin Grant's silent, retreating figure.

The man who had always watched over her in silence. If she could see him again, she'd gather the courage to embrace him—no longer ashamed of her scars, no longer held back by her past.

"Filthy whore, let's see how tough you are now!" Hugo's sneer exploded in her ear. Bella's eyes snapped open. With her last ounce of strength, she grabbed the metal photo frame from the bedside—

If she was going to die, she'd drag this demon to hell with her!
###Chapter 232: Andrew's Cheesy Antics

Hugo Thompson licked his lips, his eyes glinting with lust. "Bella Quinn, don't come crying for mercy later!"

BANG!

The moment Calvin Grant's men picked the lock, he kicked the door open. Hugo was just about to assault Bella when a sharp pain shot through his shoulder. He was thrown violently to the ground.

"Ah—!"

Hugo landed right on a pile of shattered porcelain, blood immediately staining his clothes. He writhed in agony, but fury burned in his eyes.

"Who the hell dares—" He scrambled up, cursing, but the words died in his throat when he saw who stood before him.

Forcing a servile smile through the pain, he stammered, "C-Calvin... What brings you here?"

Remembering his connection to the Bowman family, Hugo straightened up. "Calvin, this woman was a gift from my brother-in-law. How about we—"

CRACK!

Calvin's fist smashed into his face. Hugo spat out a mouthful of blood, two front teeth mixed in.

"Calvin!" Hugo clutched his mouth, howling. "I'm Bruce's brother-in-law!"

Calvin's gaze was icy. Another punch shattered Hugo's nose. The man's eyes rolled back, too dazed to even scream.

"Touch my woman? You're dead." Calvin kicked Hugo square between the legs, sending him flying into the corner.

Hugo curled into a whimpering ball, like a dying shrimp.

"Bella!" Trembling, Calvin gathered the bloodied woman into his arms. "I'm sorry..."

Bella weakly shook her head. "Not... too late..."

"Bella!" Susan Thompson rushed in, tears instantly streaming down her face. "Does it hurt?"

Bella managed a faint smile. "I'm okay."

Spotting Susan, Hugo seized his chance. "Sis! Calvin's trying to kill me!"

Susan finally noticed him in the corner. Rage ignited in her eyes. She lunged forward and kicked him. "You monster!"

"Susan!" Andrew Lucas quickly pulled her back, then delivered a few more kicks himself. "Let me handle the dirty work."

He pulled an exquisite porcelain vial from his pocket. "Stop crying. I brought the medicine."

Susan froze. She hadn't expected him to actually procure it.

Andrew leaned in, whispering in her ear, "That kiss last night was worth it, huh?"

Susan's face flushed crimson. Just as she was about to snap, the door burst open again.

Bruce Bowman stormed in, his expression dark, an aura of lethal frost radiating from him.
###Chapter 233: Andrew Lucas Fights for Susan Thompson

The tall figure at the bedroom doorway made Bella Quinn tremble.

The person she once relied on most had become her deepest fear.

Calvin Grant tightened his arms around her, sensing her shaking.

"Don't be afraid," his deep voice carried a soothing strength.

Bruce Bowman stood at the door, his gaze dark and terrifying as he watched Bella nestled in Calvin's embrace.

He had already decided to hand her over to Hugo Thompson, yet he'd inexplicably followed them here.

"Bella Quinn, you're still alive?" Bruce's voice was icy.

"Get out!" Susan Thompson trembled with rage.

Andrew Lucas had uncovered everything on the way—Bruce not only gave Bella to Hugo but also planned to marry her off to that beast tomorrow.

"Shut up!" Bruce snapped.

Thud!

Andrew's fist slammed into Bruce's face.

"Andrew!" Bruce clutched his cheek in disbelief.

Andrew's eyes were sharp as blades. "Dare to yell at my woman? Asking for death?"

"Your woman?" Bruce sneered. "Birds of a feather. If Bella's a tramp, how much better can Susan be?"

Thud!

Another brutal punch landed.

"Apologize," Andrew's voice was terrifyingly cold.

Bruce spat blood. "Dream on."

Andrew swung again without hesitation.

The two men brawled violently, turning the room into chaos.

Though Susan disliked Andrew, watching him beat Bruce gave her an inexplicable satisfaction.

Calvin carried Bella out swiftly. Susan grabbed Hugo's phone and smashed it against his face before following.

Seeing Susan leave, Andrew stopped fighting but delivered one last punch to Bruce before walking away.

"Brother-in-law!" Hugo wailed. "Avenge me!"

Bruce stared coldly at the repulsive man on the floor, suddenly overwhelmed with disgust.

Even if Bella were blind, she'd never stoop to this.

"Scram!" He kicked Hugo aside and strode out.

At the hospital, Bella's injuries looked severe but fortunately weren't life-threatening.

Susan stayed by her side, distracting her with conversation when Calvin entered.

He carried a sandalwood urn.

"Your grandmother's," Calvin said softly.

Bella's eyes reddened instantly.

Her hands shook as she took the familiar silver locket—something she'd worn as a child.

"Grandma..." She clutched the urn and sobbed uncontrollably.

Susan's eyes welled up, reminded of her own murdered grandmother.

Unable to bear her sorrow, Andrew gently led her out of the room.

"Thank you," Susan whispered.

Andrew's gaze burned. "Really thanking me?"

"Give me one chance. Let's start over."
###Chapter 234: Mr. Lucas, It's Over Between Us

Susan's eyelashes fluttered like butterfly wings caught in a breeze.

Her heart softened uncontrollably for a fleeting moment before tightening painfully again.

Memories of heartbreak surged over her like a tidal wave, bringing instant clarity.

There was no going back for them.

She abruptly pushed Andrew away, putting several steps between them.

"Mr. Lucas." She lifted her gaze, her expression terrifyingly calm. "I remember you saying the only way you wouldn't be disgusted was by treating me as Nicole's substitute."

Andrew's face drained of color.

"Why bother now?" Susan's voice was soft. "You love Nicole so much. Why force yourself because of Daniel?"

"Susan, that's not true!" Andrew stepped forward urgently, grabbing her hand.

Only now did he realize his past cruel words had become knives stabbing his own heart.

"There's no need." Susan yanked her hand free. "Daniel is your child—I won't deny that. But we're over."

"Broken mirrors can't be mended. Forcing this would only torture us both." Her quiet voice carried lethal precision. "I'm happy now. I won't invite misery back into my life."

Pain flashed in Andrew's eyes.

He pulled Susan into a crushing embrace, his voice hoarse. "Susan, I don't love Nicole. It's only ever been you!"

The familiarity of his arms made Susan's mind waver momentarily.

But she quickly regained her composure.

"Save those words for someone else, Mr. Lucas." Her tone turned icy. "The heart that loved you died long ago."

"Impossible!" Andrew suddenly captured her lips in a domineering kiss. "You'll only love me in this life, the next, and every lifetime after!"

Susan struggled violently but couldn't match his strength.

Only when she nearly suffocated did Andrew reluctantly release her.

"Susan," he murmured, caressing her cheek with unbearable tenderness. "I know you still love me. Give me another chance."

Susan laughed abruptly.

"Mr. Lucas, remember our vow? 'One lifetime, one love.'"

Her gaze turned glacial. "Four years ago, it was Henry who forced me. I've never betrayed you all these years."

"But you?" Her voice began trembling. "You slept with Nicole. She carried your child!"

"I may not be some delicate flower, but I won't tolerate betrayal." Each word fell like a hammer. "I warned you—if you betrayed me, I'd walk away."

"Now, I don't want you anymore."

Andrew stood frozen as if struck by lightning.

Susan seized the moment to shove him away and fled the hospital without looking back.

The night wind chilled her tear-streaked face.

The man who'd sworn to protect her forever had become the thorn she could never remove from her heart.

Andrew remained rooted, his fists clenched until his knuckles whitened.

He wanted to explain he'd been drunk that night, unaware of what happened.

But infidelity was infidelity—no excuse could change that.

Yet he couldn't let go.

No matter what, he'd win her back.

Susan returned to her apartment late at night.

Daniel was with Benjamin. Not wanting to disturb the elderly man, she decided to fetch her son tomorrow.

Her phone buzzed with a notification.

The online writer Nina Young had updated "The Domineering CEO's Pampered Internet Celebrity Wife."

Susan opened it and nearly threw her phone in fury.

The male lead had been rewritten as Andrew!

The latest chapter's graphic description of Andrew forcing himself on her in a bathroom was downright obscene.

As she prepared to call and confront Andrew, her phone vibrated wildly.

It was Leo calling.

"Miss Thompson," his voice was unusually frantic. "Mr. Lucas is in trouble!"
###Chapter 235: Daniel Almond Kidnapped

After being rejected, Andrew Lucas drowned his sorrows in alcohol all night and ended up in the emergency room.

Susan Thompson was on set filming when she received the call from Leo Miller. His voice trembled on the other end: "Ms. Thompson, Mr. Lucas is unconscious from a stomach hemorrhage. The doctors say he needs immediate surgery, but he keeps calling your name..."

Her fingers tightened around the phone. She had told herself not to care about him anymore, yet hearing this news felt like an invisible hand squeezing her heart.

"I'll be right there."

Hanging up, Susan hastily excused herself from the director. By the time she reached the hospital, Andrew had already been wheeled into the operating room. Leo stood guard outside, his eyes red-rimmed, relief flooding his face when he saw her.

"Ms. Thompson, Mr. Lucas barely ate these past few days. He survived on alcohol alone. The doctors said if he'd arrived half an hour later, he might have..."

Susan pressed her lips together, staring at the glowing red light above the operating room. She remembered the agony of her own stomach cancer—like thousands of needles piercing through her. No one understood that pain better than her.

Three hours later, the light turned off. The surgeon emerged, announcing the procedure was successful but required rest.

In the hospital room, Andrew lay pale as paper, an IV drip attached to his hand. Susan stood by the bed, watching his closed eyes and furrowed brows, a dull ache spreading through her chest.

"Water..." A weak voice came from the bed.

Susan quickly poured a glass of water and carefully lifted his head. Andrew's eyes fluttered open, and the moment he recognized her, the dullness in his gaze brightened.

"Susan..." His fingers, icy yet burning, wrapped around her wrist. "You came."

She tried to pull away, but his grip tightened.

"Mr. Lucas, let go," she said, turning her face away from his hopeful expression. "I just wanted to see if you were still alive."

Andrew gave a bitter smile. "Would you be sad if I died?"

The question stole her breath. Of course she would—but she couldn't say it.

"Daniel needs his father," was all she offered.

"Just Daniel?" Andrew struggled to sit up, the IV line shaking violently. "What about you, Susan?"

She took a step back, putting distance between them. "Mr. Lucas, focus on recovering. I should go."

"Don't!" He yanked out the IV needle, blood trickling down his hand. Staggering to his feet, he pulled her into his arms. "I know you still care. Susan, give me one more chance—"

Before she could break free, her phone rang sharply.

An unknown number flashed on the screen. She answered, and a mechanically distorted voice spoke:

"Susan Thompson, Daniel Almond is with me."
###Chapter 236: A Life for a Life

Susan Thompson's heart clenched when she heard the unfamiliar male voice on the phone.

"Don't touch Daniel!"

Her nails dug into her palms as her voice trembled. "Where are you? What do you want?"

Daniel took evening walks in the square every day. This madman must have snatched him there.

The eerie silence on the other end nearly suffocated her. She gripped the phone until her knuckles turned white. "Please don't hurt him! I'll give you anything!"

Memories of South Mountain Cliff flooded back. The image of Daniel being thrown over the edge flashed through her mind. A crushing pain struck her chest, bending her double.

"Speak! What have you done to Daniel?!"

Lucas Lynch's icy voice finally responded. "Susan, remember Louis Lynch? My brother!"

"Andrew Lucas had him killed in a hit-and-run! Today, I'll use Andrew's blood to avenge him!"

"Tell him to come to South Mountain Cliff within an hour, or—" Lucas sneered, "I'll chop the brat into pieces and feed him to dogs!"

"Last time, he was lucky to survive. Let's see if he can cheat death again!"

The call ended abruptly.

Susan stared at the blackened screen, her body turning cold. Trade Andrew for Daniel? The man who couldn't even let go of Nicole Capra—how could he risk his life for Daniel?

She frantically redialed, but only got a busy tone.

"Susan, is Daniel in trouble?"

Andrew's voice suddenly sounded beside her. He'd heard everything.

He took her freezing hands. "Don't be afraid. I'll bring him home."

Before she could react, he'd already rushed out of the private room.

The lingering warmth in her palm stunned her. Was he really going? Wasn't he afraid to die?

Tears spilled over. Limping on her sprained ankle, she chased after him—only to see the taillights of his Koenigsegg vanish into the night.

"I'll use Andrew Lucas's blood to avenge my brother!"

Lucas's words exploded in her ears. Susan flagged down a taxi, trembling. "South Mountain!"

She didn't understand why Lucas blamed Andrew for his brother's death. But she knew one thing—Andrew was going there to trade his life for Daniel's safety.

He was willing to die for Daniel.

The neon lights outside the window blurred into streaks. Wiping her tears, Susan clutched her aching chest.

Daniel was her life.

But the man she'd once loved and hated—wasn't he also?

The bitter wind cut like knives. When Susan reached the cliff, she saw Daniel pinned near the edge, his small face deathly pale.

Lucas's thugs brandished machetes, their faces twisted with malice.

Andrew stood under the lights, his suit jacket flapping in the wind. His gaze fixed on Lucas, colder than ice.

"Let him go."

"Andrew Lucas, do you think we're fools?" Lucas laughed wildly. "This is your own son! Even if you won't trade your life, killing him will give my brother peace!"

Daniel lay quietly by the cliff's edge. He didn't cry or struggle—just stole one glance at Andrew before lowering his head.

He loved his father. But he remembered—this was where his father had abandoned him.

"Mom and Dad should go home," Daniel whispered. "I'll be okay."

Tears fell silently. "Dad should treat Mom better... Mom should give Dad another chance..."

He forced a small smile. "I love you both."

Andrew suddenly stepped forward, his voice steel.

"Tell me. How do you want me to die?"
###Chapter 237: The Castration Blade

Daniel Almond jerked his head up, tears blurring his vision. He couldn't believe the father who had once abandoned him was now willing to die for him.

"Dad, no!" Daniel shook his head violently, his voice hoarse from screaming. "I'm not afraid to die! You need to stay alive to protect Mom!"

Susan Thompson's heart felt like it was being torn apart. She finally understood this was another one of Nicole Capra's vicious schemes—using Lucas Lynch to eliminate Daniel.

Andrew Lucas's gaze had never been so tender. He stared at Daniel, the child he'd personally cast aside, who was now only concerned for his safety.

"Let him go." Andrew turned to Lucas Lynch, his voice icy. "Take my life instead."

Lucas Lynch sneered and tossed a knife at him. "Andrew Lucas, always so decisive! But death is too easy for you. I want you to suffer!"

The blade flashed as Andrew plunged it into his left shoulder without hesitation. Blood instantly stained his white shirt.

"Are you insane?!" Susan rushed forward, but Andrew effortlessly dodged her. He even smiled at her. "Don't cry, Susan. It doesn't hurt."

Lucas Lynch dragged the sobbing Daniel back a step. "Second strike—left arm!"

The sickening sound of the blade piercing flesh made Susan tremble. Yet Andrew gently wiped her tears away. "One kiss, and the pain will disappear."

This bastard! Even at death's door, he was still flirting!

But Susan rose on her toes and kissed him fiercely. If she'd known this was goodbye, she wouldn't have wasted so much time.

"Third strike—" Lucas Lynch grinned maliciously. "Since my brother lost his manhood, you won't keep yours either!"

The sharp blade pointed straight at Andrew's groin.

Susan's heart nearly stopped. She clutched Andrew's hand, but he gently pushed her away.

"Remember," he whispered in her ear, "no matter what happens, take Daniel and leave."

He turned to face Lucas Lynch, a cold smirk curling his lips. "Go ahead. Show me what you've got."
###Chapter 238: Andrew Lucas's Proposal

Lucas Lynch's sinister gaze locked onto Andrew Lucas.

The most prestigious young master of Greenhill becoming a eunuch...

Just imagining that scene made him tremble with excitement.

He looked up at the dark night sky. "Big brother, watch me make those who killed you pay!"

Seeing Andrew hesitate, Lucas pressed the knife harder against Daniel's neck. Blood immediately seeped out.

"Can't do it, Mr. Lucas? Then I'll send this brat to hell first!"

"Willing to throw away your life over this?" Andrew twirled the knife casually, as if discussing the weather.

Susan Thompson bit her lip hard, her nails digging into her palms.

Tears blurred her vision as she watched Andrew slowly raise the knife.

"Big brother, do you see? Mr. Lucas won't be a man much longer!" Lucas laughed maniacally. "Soon he'll join you!"

Suddenly, muffled thuds sounded. Lucas whirled around.

His men lay in pools of blood, crimson dots marking their foreheads.

"Andrew, you—"

A flash of steel.

Lucas's eyes widened as blood gushed from his throat. He collapsed stiffly.

"Daniel!"

Susan rushed forward and clutched her son tightly, terrified he'd disappear if she let go.

"Mommy, it doesn't hurt." Daniel hid his injured hand behind his back, offering a sweet smile.

Leo Miller and his team emerged from the woods, supporting Andrew. "Sir!"

"I'm fine."

Though pale, Andrew's eyes burned with intensity.

He'd arranged snipers in advance, waiting for Lucas to step away from the cliff's edge.

"Susan." Pushing Leo aside, he walked toward her.

His smile in the sunlight was dazzling enough to make hearts tremble.

"You cried for me. You still love me, don't you?"

"Andrew..."

Susan threw herself into his arms.

At life's brink, past grudges seemed trivial.

"Susan!" Ignoring his wound's pain, Andrew kissed her deeply.

"Uncle Leo can't peek!" Daniel covered his eyes. "Teacher Jing says it's rude!"

Blushing, Susan pushed Andrew away.

Leo stifled a laugh and quickly arranged their transport home.

The doctor confirmed the wounds weren't deep, but Andrew insisted on recuperating at Susan's place.

"I'm staying here," he declared shamelessly.

That night, Andrew held Susan gently.

Though his body ached for more, today's blood loss...

He gritted his teeth. Tomorrow, he'd pull out all the stops.

Susan signed with her senior Cecilia Grant's studio.

"Third female lead!" She rushed home excitedly with the contract to share the news.

As she entered the neighborhood, rose petals suddenly rained from the sky.

Then, fireworks exploded across the night:

"Susan, marry me."
###Chapter 239: Susan's Husband Isn't Andrew Lucas!

"Leo, I adore roses the most."

"If you want to marry me, you'll have to propose with a city full of roses. Otherwise, I won't say yes!"

"Susan, I'll make sure all of Seaview blooms with roses."

Amidst the swirling rose petals, whole crimson roses stood out—fiery and breathtakingly beautiful.

Susan bent to pick up one perfect rose, her fingers trembling slightly.

So he remembered the playful promise from their youth.

Her eyes grew warm. As she turned, she could almost see the boy in white walking toward her with roses in his hands.

The boy from her memories slowly merged with the man before her—Andrew Lucas. Time had left no mark on his face, only enhancing his radiance.

Gazing at Andrew holding the roses, Susan thought his face truly lived up to the title "Timeless Beauty."

She was utterly enchanted.

"Susan, marry me."

Andrew knelt on one knee, his gaze burning. "I'll love you, protect you, and be faithful to you for the rest of my life. Together in life and death, never apart."

Roses bloomed under fireworks—this was the dream of her girlhood. The man before her was the only one she had ever loved.

Her throat tightened. All she could do was nod firmly.

Andrew was overjoyed, fumbling as he pulled out the ring. The usually composed Andrew Lucas now looked as clumsy as a nervous teenager.

His hands shook so badly he failed seven or eight times to slide the ring onto her finger.

Susan nearly laughed. Who would have thought the formidable Andrew Lucas couldn't even put on a ring properly?

When the ring almost dropped for the ninth time, Susan almost reached to help—but held back. Surely he'd manage before the night ended?

Finally, the ring settled securely on her ring finger.

Noticing Susan's missing pinky, Andrew's eyes darkened. He gently clasped her hand. "Susan, you're mine now. You can only be my wife for the rest of your life."

"Who wants to be your wife?" Susan retorted, blushing.

"I'll shamelessly chase only you." Andrew swept her into his arms. "Tonight, let's be shameless together."

"Put me down! Your wound might reopen!"

"It's just a scratch." He held her tighter. "Even if my arm breaks, I'll still carry my wife. I want to hold you like this forever."

Susan muttered half-hearted protests, but her heart was sweet with joy.

Watching the fireworks light up the night sky, she suddenly worried. "Aren't fireworks banned in this neighborhood?"

"Don't worry." Andrew smirked. If anyone got scolded, it would be Leo.

Back at the apartment, Susan moved toward the kitchen. "Aren't you hungry?"

Andrew's gaze darkened. "I am hungry." He kissed her deeply. "But what I crave is you."

Late that night, Andrew lay content with Susan asleep in his arms. Then his phone buzzed on the nightstand.

The word "Husband" on the screen stabbed at his eyes.

His expression turned stormy as he stepped onto the balcony. The phone rang again.

"Susan, I miss you." Henry Bartley's voice came through the receiver.
###Chapter 240: Andrew Lucas and Susan Thompson - The World Crumbles

"Henry..."

Susan had been with Andrew Lucas for so long, yet she'd never once called him "husband." But she uttered that intimate term for Henry with such ease.

How laughable that he'd believed her explanation—that the incident four years ago was Henry forcing himself on her.

Thud!

Andrew's fingers trembled, and the phone crashed onto the balcony tiles.

The gray ceramic reflected the cold glow of the screen. The device remained intact, and Henry's voice continued clearly.

"Susan, darling, what's wrong?" Henry instantly sensed it wasn't Susan who had picked up.

He'd only been testing his luck—and hit the jackpot.

"Sweetheart, why aren't you speaking? Are you feeling unwell? Don't scare me!" Henry suppressed a smirk, layering his tone with urgency.

Andrew bent to retrieve the phone, his knuckles whitening from the force of his grip.

"Are you still upset with me, love? It was my fault for asking you to get close to Andrew Lucas." Henry's voice dripped with unsettling tenderness. "Every night, I burn with jealousy."

"But for our future, you'll have to endure it a little longer." He continued smoothly, "I can see Andrew still cares for you. Just string him along, and we'll live in luxury."

"You can give him a taste, but don't let him touch you." Henry's voice shook. "The thought of another man's hands on you—it's unbearable."

"The plan is working. Daniel has been acknowledged as his heir." Henry chuckled darkly. "Once the boy has an... accident, and we get the inheritance, we can finally be happy."

"The Bartley Group belongs to my elder brother now. I can't give you the life you deserve." His tone turned apologetic. "But I'll treat Daniel as my own, even if he isn't biologically mine."

"Darling, say something, please?" Henry suddenly brightened. "Ah, I sent you that video you wanted! Watching it will feel like I'm right there with you."

"Oh, and I've captured Nicole Capra." He lowered his voice. "Tomorrow's headlines will feature her scandalous photos. I'll send you the address. Want to come torture her yourself?"

The call ended with an exaggerated kissing sound.

Andrew stood frozen, his fingers clenched until they turned blue.

A WeChat notification snapped him back.

A video arrived from "My Beloved Husband."

Knowing it was poison, Andrew tapped play.

The screen showed Susan and Henry entangled on a bed. The sheets moved rhythmically, their heavy breaths unmistakable.

"Who's better—me or Andrew Lucas?" Henry rasped.

"You, of course!" Susan's voice was sickly sweet. "That fool could never compare to my husband!"

"Are you angry about having his child?"

"Why would I be? Once he's dead, the child inherits everything, and we'll live like royalty!"

"Such a good girl. I'll always love only you."

"And I only love you. Andrew Lucas is nothing!"

The phone hit the floor again.

The video kept playing, but Andrew couldn't bear to watch.

Kill him? Let that cripple inherit everything?

Susan... you're dead.
###Chapter 241: Susan Thompson, You've Betrayed Me, Andrew Lucas!

How dare a cripple covet the Lucas family fortune?

Even if he had the guts, he wouldn't live long enough to enjoy it!

Andrew Lucas knelt on the floor, shivering from the icy pain in his chest. He reached for his phone but couldn't grasp it.

How pathetic—he'd stabbed himself twice for that cripple.

How pathetic—he'd even considered dying for that cripple last night.

How pathetic—he'd begged Susan Thompson for forgiveness like a fool, planned an elaborate proposal, and gone down on one knee to ask for her hand.

How pathetic—he'd actually believed Susan had been faithful, torturing himself with guilt over Nicole Capra's pregnancy.

How pathetic—he'd thought Susan cared for him.

Utterly pathetic...

Andrew closed his eyes. Susan, did you enjoy making a fool out of me? Laughing at how stupid Andrew Lucas is?

Playing games with me while pretending to love Henry Bartley—doesn't it sicken you?

He turned abruptly, his dark gaze landing on Susan's sleeping face.

Stumbling to the balcony, he retrieved his phone and staggered back to the bed like a walking corpse.

A smile still lingered on her lips.

Look—even in her dreams, she's gloating about deceiving this idiot!

Andrew sat on the edge of the bed, his fingers closing around her slender neck.

Susan, why are you doing this to me?

Is toying with my feelings fun for you?

But he released her.

The bitter truth struck him—even if she lied, hurt him, or wanted him dead, he still couldn't bring himself to harm her.

Tears welled in his bloodshot eyes as he withdrew his hand.

He appeared invincible, yet was fragile to the core.

And this fragility existed only because of her.

He loved her, so he feared losing her.

Tracing her delicate features, he'd thought happiness was within reach—only to be discarded.

Or perhaps she'd never been his to begin with.

"Susan, you're heartless!"

Andrew's teeth ground together. He despised himself for being unable to hurt this viper.

No matter how much he hated her, he'd rather endure agony than see her suffer.

So his fist didn't strike her face—it smashed into the bedframe instead. Blood dripped, yet he felt no pain.

All suffering concentrated in his heart, where no wound could bring relief.

Clutching his chest, he surrendered to the bone-deep torment.

The pain paralyzed him. He wished for death.

But Henry's phone call forced him to move.

Nicole might already be in Henry's clutches. If he didn't act now, her life would be ruined!

Grabbing Susan's phone, Henry's address flashed on the unlocked screen.

Andrew didn't bother with a coat. Snatching his keys, he bolted out the door.

He had to reach Nicole in time.

Henry's villa stood in the suburbs.

Andrew sped through the night, arriving quickly.

Henry had been "thoughtful"—even providing the gate code: Susan's birthday.

The gates swung open as Andrew entered the numbers, his expression murderous.

Only one room on the second floor was lit.

Nicole's screams pierced the air as he mounted the stairs.

"Help! No!"

"Andrew, save me!"

"Henry Bartley, you monster! Let me go! Please!"

Slap!

The sharp sound of repeated blows echoed.

Then Henry's cold voice: "Nicole Capra, shut up! You hurt my Susan—now I'll destroy you."

"Make my wife unhappy? I'll make you wish for death."

"Tonight, you're going straight to hell!"

"No!" Nicole sobbed hysterically. "I never touched Susan—she's the one framing me! Henry, please!"

"I only love Andrew! How can I live after this?"

The screams came from the end of the hall.

Andrew kicked open the slightly ajar door.

Nicole lay bound to the bed, covered in blood, surrounded by recording equipment.

Henry had already violated her.

"Keep screaming and I'll kill you!" Henry raised his hand again.

Andrew lunged, sending Henry flying with a kick.

Seeing Andrew, Nicole's tears overflowed.

Her swollen face twisted as she tried hiding her shame, but the restraints held her fast.

Turning away, she wept: "Andrew, don't look...I'm filthy now...just kill me!"
###Chapter 242: The Engagement

"Andrew... I... Henry, he..." Nicole Capra curled up in the corner of the bed, her slender fingers clutching the sheets as tears streamed down her pale face.

Henry Bartley scrambled to gather his scattered clothes, staggering out of the room but not without casting one last glance behind him.

Andrew Lucas's fists clenched, veins bulging, yet he didn't give chase. He feared what Nicole might do if he left her alone.

The glaring bloodstains on the sheets made his pupils constrict sharply.

"Nicole..."

Gently, he untied the ropes binding her and wrapped her tightly in the sheets. But Nicole flinched away from his touch like a frightened animal.

"Don't touch me..." She trembled, hugging her knees. "I'm filthy... I don't deserve you anymore..."

Andrew's heart ached as if sliced by a dull blade. He thought of Susan Thompson's deceitful smile and how he had betrayed the girl who had given him everything for a woman like that.

"I'm sorry." He pulled Nicole into his arms, his voice hoarse. "I failed to protect you."

Nicole shook violently in his embrace, her tears soaking through his shirt. "It was Susan... Susan told Henry to do this to me... I don't blame her... really..."

Her words stabbed into Andrew's heart like a knife. He tightened his hold, his voice low but firm. "Nicole, marry me."

Her body stiffened in his arms.

"Next month." He stroked her hair. "I'll give you the grandest wedding."

Nicole looked up, her swollen eyes filled with disbelief. "But Susan—"

"Don't mention her." Andrew's gaze turned icy. "From now on, you're the only woman I'll call my wife."

Nicole buried her face in his chest and sobbed uncontrollably. Andrew mechanically patted her back, feeling his heart slowly wither.

Love? What a ridiculous notion.

The greatest regret of Andrew Lucas's life was entrusting his heart to that venomous woman. From this moment on, he would live for only two things—

Revenge against Susan Thompson.
And taking care of Nicole Capra.

After Nicole cried herself to sleep, Andrew smashed every recording device in the room. He dialed Ryan Lucas's number, his voice cold as ice. "Brother, hack into all of Henry's storage devices."

Hanging up, he smirked self-deprecatingly. Even now, he was still worried that the footage might ruin Susan's reputation.

How utterly foolish.

The sound of running water came from the bathroom. Andrew waited in the living room, but the water never stopped. A sudden sense of foreboding gripped him—

The heavy scent of blood seeped through the door crack.
###Chapter 243: Bloody Revenge - Andrew Demands Susan's Life

"Nina!"

Andrew kicked open the bathroom door. His pupils constricted at the sight before him.

Nicole lay in a pool of blood, her left wrist bearing a gruesome gash that still oozed crimson. A blood-stained eyebrow razor rested nearby, its scarlet glare searing into his nerves.

He snatched a towel to wrap around Nicole and carried her out in a frantic rush.

In the private hospital corridor, Andrew stared at the emergency room's red light, his knuckles whitening. The doctor said five minutes later would have been too late.

"It's all Susan's fault..." He ground out the name between clenched teeth.

At dawn, Nicole was wheeled out of surgery. Jenny arrived to tend to her. Andrew turned on his heel—he had a debt to collect.

Susan awoke to golden sunlight.

Her fingers brushed the empty space beside her, lips curving unconsciously. The diamond ring on her left hand sparkled, its pink rose carving lifelike in the morning glow.

She recognized this ring. Four years ago, she'd seen its design in Andrew's apartment. She never thought he'd actually have it made.

Humming in the kitchen, Susan prepared lunch. The turn of the door lock made her pulse quicken.

"Andy!" She spun around eagerly, but her smile froze.

Andrew stood in the doorway, his eyes churning with a fury she'd never witnessed.

"I made your favorite..." Her voice trailed off.

Those same eyes that had brimmed with tenderness last night now held nothing but murderous ice.
###Chapter 244: Andrew, You've Changed!

"Andrew?" Susan Thompson shivered under Andrew Lucas's piercing gaze, instinctively stepping back half a step.

Dark currents swirled in his pupils as if threatening to swallow her whole. He suddenly grabbed her chin with bruising force.

"It hurts..." Susan's eyes instantly reddened.

"Hurt?" Andrew sneered. "Now you know pain?"

Releasing her abruptly, Susan staggered and barely caught herself on the sofa. The man who'd been tender moments ago had transformed into someone unrecognizable.

"Andrew, what's wrong?" She fought through the throbbing pain in her jaw.

Andrew pulled out his phone, displaying a photo of Nicole Capra lying pale on a hospital bed, her wrists wrapped in thick bandages.

"She attempted suicide." His voice turned glacial. "Because of you."

Susan's pupils contracted. "Me? I haven't seen her recently!"

"Playing dumb?" He seized her wrist. "Watch this!"

A video played onscreen—Susan disheveled in Henry Bartley's embrace, whispering sickening sweet nothings.

"No... this isn't real!" Susan trembled violently. "He forced me to film this four years ago!"

"Forced you?" Andrew's lips curled mockingly. "You looked quite willing."

A sharp pain twisted Susan's stomach. She crumpled to the floor, sweat drenching her back.

"Faking illness again?" Andrew loomed over her. "I won't fall for it this time."

"Andrew..." She lifted her face with effort. "You promised to trust me..."

"Trust you?" He exploded, punching the wall. "I was a goddamn fool to believe you!"

A framed painting crashed down, glass shattering across the floor. Susan flinched as tears finally spilled over.

"That cripple..." Andrew bent close, his whisper terrifyingly gentle. "I'll make him wish he were dead."

Susan clutched his sleeve desperately. "Daniel's innocent!"

He pried her fingers off one by one. "Starting today, neither of you will know peace."

Turning on his heel, he strode out. Susan tried to follow but collapsed from the agony in her ankle.

"Andrew Lucas!" She screamed at the empty doorway. "Come back and let me explain!"

Only the slam of the door answered her.
###Chapter 245: A Love Beyond Redemption

Susan trembled violently, instinctively shielding Daniel behind her.

"Andrew, don't hurt Daniel!"

Her voice shook as her nails dug into her palms.

"Nothing happened between Henry and me! That video was forced!"

Andrew Lucas sneered, his eyes glinting with cold fury.

"By threatening your grandmother?" His lips curled in mockery. "Susan, aren't you tired of these lies?"

She bit her lower lip.

She couldn't explain the full context of that video. Ironically, Henry's loyalty to Nicole Capra back then had become her only saving grace.

"Andrew, I swear Henry and I are innocent."

"Innocent?" He lunged forward but stopped just short of touching her. "Were you also forced when you called him 'husband'?"

Susan's pupils contracted.

She suddenly remembered—during the King's Glory audition, Megan York had tampered with her bag. Nicole's trap had been set long ago.

"This is Nicole's scheme!"

"Enough!" Andrew roared. "Nicole is suffering unimaginably, yet you still slander her?"

Susan laughed then.

A laugh so desolate it chilled the bone.

"Andrew, you're pitiful." Her voice was barely a whisper. "Played like a fool by a murderer."

Rage exploded in Andrew's eyes.

He seized her wrist and dragged her brutally from the apartment.

In a guest room at the villa, a greasy middle-aged man rubbed his hands in anticipation. His eyes gleamed with greed at the sight of her.

Susan's heart turned to ice.

"Mr. Wang, enjoy yourself." Andrew's voice dripped venom. "She loves these games."

Susan didn't struggle.

She simply stared at Andrew with terrifying emptiness.

"Last chance." He gripped her chin. "Why did you hurt Nicole?"

Susan closed her eyes slowly.

A single tear fell soundlessly.

At last, she understood—what stood between them wasn't misunderstanding, but an abyss of trust that could never be crossed.
###Chapter 246: Andrew, You Owe Me an Apology

Susan bit her lower lip until it turned white.

She would never confess to something she didn't do.

Not even when Andrew Lucas threatened her in the cruelest way possible.

She lifted her chin, the defiance in her eyes stinging him like shards of glass.

"Andrew," she whispered, her voice soft yet razor-sharp. "My greatest regret was believing you were still the man I once loved."

Her oath cut deeper than any blade.

"If I ever love you again, may I find no peace in life nor rest in death."

His knuckles cracked under the strain of his clenched fists.

She would rather curse herself than love him.

That truth shattered what little restraint he had left.

"Mr. Ferber," Andrew commanded, his voice glacial. "Don't disappoint me."

Susan laughed then—a hollow, broken sound.

So this was how it felt when a heart turned numb.

The man she loved most was pushing her into hell.

How poetic.

"Mr. Lucas..." William Ferber wiped his sweaty brow. "Perhaps you'd prefer to wait outside—"

"Do I need to repeat myself?" Andrew's dangerous whisper silenced him instantly.

"Susan." Andrew seized her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. "Apologize. To Nicole."

This was his final mercy.

"You're the ones who should beg forgiveness!" Pain lanced through her abdomen, but she refused to yield. "You and Nicole owe me that much!"

Her silent stare conveyed what words could not.

You're wrong, Andrew.

But even if you apologized now, it's too late.

"Very well." Andrew's chuckle sent chills down her spine. "Mr. Ferber, proceed."

When William's greasy fingers closed around her wrist, nausea overwhelmed her.

Her gaze fell to the diamond ring on her finger—the one Andrew had slipped onto her hand just last night with such tenderness.

Now he would tear it away himself.

"Reluctant to part with it?" Andrew sneered. "I'm sure it'll fetch a pretty price."

He wrenched her hand violently.

"But I won't let a faithless woman profit from my generosity!"

The band sliced her skin as he ripped it off.

Blood dripped from her finger like the shattered pieces of her heart.
###Chapter 247: Daddy, Why Are You Hurting Mommy?!

Susan's fingers trembled slightly.

She tried to curl them into fists, but Andrew wrenched them open with brutal force. His grip was terrifyingly strong as he yanked the ring off her left ring finger.

The diamond glittered coldly under the lights.

"Disgusting." Andrew sneered at the ring.

With a sudden flick of his wrist, the ring traced a silver arc through the air before vanishing out the window.

Susan felt her heart shatter into pieces.

Mr. Ferber could no longer contain himself. He grabbed Susan's waist, pressing his greasy face close to her ear. "Susan..."

A sharp pain stabbed through Susan's stomach.

She recognized that face—Bella Quinn had nearly been destroyed by this monster. Rumor had it he and Hugo Thompson were equally skilled at torturing women.

"Get away..." She struggled weakly.

Andrew stood with his back turned, knuckles white from clenching his fists.

He thought he was punishing Susan, yet his own heart bled as if sliced by knives.

BANG!

The door burst open.

Alexander Grant stormed in like a black lightning bolt, kicking Mr. Ferber across the room. Pale-faced Daniel followed close behind.

"Mommy!" Daniel threw himself at Susan, fat tears rolling down his cheeks.

Susan's white dress was already stained crimson with blood.

Andrew's pupils contracted violently.

"Daddy!" Daniel suddenly turned to Andrew, voice choked with sobs. "You promised to protect Mommy!"

Dead silence filled the room.

Only Susan's muffled coughs and the expanding pool of blood on the floor could be heard.
###Chapter 248: Mr. Lucas, It Ends Here!

Daniel clenched his small fists, nails digging deep into his palms. He looked up at the father he once admired, stubbornness flickering like stars in his eyes.

"Daddy, you hurt Mommy." His voice trembled. "You promised to protect her."

Andrew Lucas's pupils constricted violently. The frail child before him bore traces of his own childhood features. The blood connection stabbed his heart, only to be drowned by raging fury.

"A pawn." He sneered. "You're just her tool to seize the Lucas fortune."

Daniel shuddered, tears welling but refusing to fall. He couldn't understand why his father's gaze had turned so terrifying, as if facing an enemy.

"I'm not a cripple." Daniel straightened his spine. "Mommy says I'm her bravest little soldier."

Andrew felt a needle-like pang. He remembered this child nearly dying to save him at the cliff. But deeper hatred swallowed the thought.

"Get out." His voice was glacial. "If I see you again, I'll throw you off this building."

Daniel's lips quivered as tears finally spilled. He wiped them quickly, standing tall like a miniature adult.

"Mr. Lucas." He imitated grown-up speech. "From today, I have no father."

The words stabbed Andrew's heart like a knife. He clenched his fists, nails drawing blood, yet felt no pain.

"Mommy." Daniel turned to hug Susan's leg. "Let's go home. I'll protect you. No bad people will hurt you again."

A metallic taste rose in Susan's throat. Suppressing the urge to vomit blood, she gently stroked her son's soft hair.

"Mommy's sorry." Her voice was feather-light. "You shouldn't have seen this."

Watching them embrace, Andrew's chest tightened painfully. He should feel triumphant—so why did his heart feel shredded?

Susan leaned against the wall to stand, each step like walking on blades. She faced Andrew, her pale face resolute.

"Mr. Lucas." She said calmly. "Let's end this."

Andrew's pupils dilated. He seized her wrist with bone-crushing force.

"End?" He laughed coldly. "You think you deserve that? Just a whore who spreads her legs for money."

Susan's lashes fluttered, but she smiled with relief. Clean breaks were best.

As she turned, blood trickled from her lips. Alexander Grant moved to support her, but she gently pushed him away.

The stairwell wind lifted her hair. Darkness swallowed Susan's vision as her body fell like a severed kite string.

The last sound she heard was Andrew's heartrending scream.
###Chapter 249: The Lost Diamond Ring

"Susan!"

Little Daniel screamed in terror, his small hands desperately reaching forward.

He watched helplessly as his mother tumbled down the stairs.

Alexander Grant lunged forward, shielding Susan in his arms at the last possible moment. They crashed down the steps together, his body forming a protective barrier around her.

Thud—

The dull impact echoed through the empty stairwell.

Susan opened her eyes to find herself cradled securely in Alexander's embrace. Her fingers trembled as she touched his bleeding hand. "Mr. Grant, you're hurt!"

"It's nothing." He withdrew his hand casually, then swept her up into his arms.

Susan instinctively struggled, but froze when she saw the bloody gash on his face.

Daniel rushed over, his eyes red-rimmed, tiny fists clutching Susan's clothes. His mother had promised never to lie to him—yet the sight of that glaring pool of blood made his heart tremble.

Andrew Lucas stood on the second-floor landing, his knuckles white with tension.

Watching Susan gaze tearfully at Alexander's wound felt like a sledgehammer to his chest. Had she already moved on to someone new?

Hmph.

His cold laugh echoed down the empty hallway. As Andrew turned away, his peripheral vision caught the bloodstains on the floor, and his steps faltered.

So much blood... Was it really just a bitten lip?

He yanked his tie loose irritably and strode to the window. On the lawn below, Mr. Wang howled like a dying pig.

Andrew's gaze fixed on those greasy hands—the same hands that had dared to touch her.

"Ah—!"

A piercing scream split the night. Andrew stepped mercilessly on Mr. Wang's wrist, grinding down until the sound of snapping bones reached his ears.

"Mr. Lucas—" Snot and tears streamed down Mr. Wang's face as he begged for mercy. "Next time, I'll teach that bitch a lesson—"

Before he could finish, a polished shoe crushed his mouth.

The butler watched in horror as his young master tore through the lawn like a madman. He retreated to a corner and dialed frantically. "Madam, the young master... he's pulling up the grass..."

Under the moonlight, Andrew knelt in the dirt, his fingers stained with soil. The diamond ring was gone—just like the love he had lost forever.

The atmosphere in Dr. Nash's clinic was heavy.

After Daniel was taken out, Alexander gripped the old doctor's wrist. "Tell me the truth, Grandfather."

Benjamin Nash sighed deeply, looking at Susan's unconscious form. Her pulse was erratic as a candle in the wind—this girl might not last through the winter.

"She—"

Outside, lightning split the sky, and rain poured down in torrents.
###Chapter 250: Susan, Marry Me!

Benjamin Nash silently took out the silver needles, his fingertips pressing gently against Susan Thompson's pale skin. Alexander Grant's knuckles turned white as his fists clenched, his voice trembling with unprecedented panic. "Grandfather, what's wrong with her?"

"Terminal stomach cancer."

The words pierced Alexander's heart like a blade. His tall frame swayed before he steadied himself against the bed.

"No!" His bloodshot eyes burned with denial. "But she was already—"

Benjamin sighed, the cold glint of the needle reflecting in his fingers. "Life and death are beyond our control. I spent a month stabilizing her condition—she should have had at least a year." He paused. "But her emotional turmoil accelerated the disease."

Alexander dropped to one knee beside the bed, his trembling hand brushing Susan's icy cheek. Memories flooded back—the grand funeral that shook the city, Andrew Lucas burying her with a widow's rites, Vincent King and Ethan Sullivan carrying her casket. He thought rebirth meant a fresh start, but fate had other plans.

"How long?" His voice was hoarse.

"That depends." Benjamin tucked the needle away. "Catherine Capra was in worse condition, yet she survived. If Susan can hold on until I finish the new treatment—"

Alexander suddenly gripped the old man's hand. "Grandfather, I'm going to marry her."

Benjamin froze, seeing the unshakable determination in his grandson's eyes. Finally, he sighed. "Do as you wish. But what about Daniel—"

"I'll raise him as my own."

The evening light filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the hospital bed. Susan's lashes fluttered as she slowly opened her eyes. The sterile scent of disinfectant left her disoriented, unsure of the time or place.

"Awake?"

The deep voice startled her. Alexander stood silhouetted against the light, his violet eyes unfathomable.

"Mr. Grant?" She tried to sit up, but his bandaged hand gently pressed her back.

"Don't move." His warmth seeped through the thin blanket. "Does your stomach still hurt?"

She shook her head, her gaze lingering on the bloodstained gauze. "Your injury—"

"Just a scratch." He withdrew his hand, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Susan, stop wasting your heart on those who don't deserve it."

Her breath hitched. That name was a dagger—one touch sent pain radiating through her chest.

"Thank you for today—"

"No thanks between us." Alexander cut her off, pulling a velvet box from his inner pocket. "I saw your promotional video."

The lid snapped open, the diamond ring glittering in the sunset.

"You belong in the spotlight." He knelt, his violet eyes stormy with emotion. "Susan, marry me."
###Chapter 251 Susan's Meteoric Rise

"Mr. Grant, what did you just say?"

Susan nearly dropped her coffee cup, convinced she'd misheard. But Alexander Grant repeated with solemn intensity, "Susan, marry me."

The air froze between them.

Her fingers absently traced the rim of her cup. Ten minutes ago they'd been discussing next season's design proposal. How had the conversation veered into marriage territory?

"That's not funny," she forced a weak smile.

Alexander leaned forward abruptly, his long fingers covering her hand. "I never joke."

Susan jerked back as if electrocuted. "I'm divorced. With a child..."

"I don't care."

"I'm dying." She met his gaze squarely. "The doctors give me two years at most."

His pupils contracted violently before steadying. "All the more reason to cherish every second."

Sunlight through the floor-to-ceiling windows sculpted his sharp profile. This titan of industry looked at her with impossibly tender eyes.

"Three days," he declared suddenly. "Give me three days to prove myself."

Before she could refuse, Alexander stood and left, his posture straight as a pine.

The glass door swung behind him as Susan pressed a hand to her constricted chest. Reason screamed for immediate rejection—until she thought of Daniel...

Her phone vibrated, shattering the moment. The screen exploded with 99+ notifications. Twitter's trending hashtag blared: #MostBeautifulDiaoChanSusan.

The video froze her in place. Moonlight illuminated a girl on a swing turning with a smile that detonated the comment section:

"Is this a goddess descending?"
"Who said Susan was ugly? Eat your words!"
"Mom, I'm in love!"

Half an hour. That's all it took to gain a million new followers. Hate accounts scrubbed their insults and vanished.

Susan switched off her phone with a bitter laugh. The irony wasn't lost on her—just as she'd resolved to walk alone toward the end, her career skyrocketed. Even Alexander...

Dew still glistened on the roses he'd left, blazing like sunlight piercing her barren existence.
###Chapter 252: Susan Thompson Outshines All, Nicole Capra and Candy Wilson Humiliated!

Raw footage never lies.

When China TV aired the unedited interview, the entire entertainment industry was shaken. Known as the "truth mirror," this network never provides celebrities with any filters or special treatment.

The camera revealed Nicole Capra's carefully crafted makeup for what it truly was. Her dull complexion and dark circles were a far cry from her usual glamorous image.

But Susan Thompson was breathtakingly beautiful.

In close-up shots, she appeared completely natural. Her translucent skin and limpid eyes could captivate millions with just a faint smile. Such peerless beauty could only be matched by Catherine Capra and Bella Lucas in the entire industry.

Netizens went wild.

"What kind of goddess-level beauty is this?"
"I'm straight but she's making me question my sexuality!"

Then two viral videos set the internet ablaze.

The first was behind-the-scenes footage from "Enchanting the World." Under peach blossoms, a red-clad enchantress danced her final farewell, sacrificing her powers for love. Those mesmerizing moves were actually performed by Susan as Nicole's dance double. The "divine dancing skills" Nicole's fans boasted about became a colossal joke.

The second video showed Susan's audition for the "Enchanted Love" perfume campaign. Dressed in red palace attire, she danced barefoot. The heartbreaking moment when a single tear fell from her sorrowful expression shattered hearts across the web.

In comparison, Nicole and Candy's campaign performances paled.

Outrage erupted.

"Where's the promised fair selection?"
"Does being the Capra heiress make you special?"
"How dare that traitor Candy steal the endorsement!"

Susan's Weibo followers surged by two million overnight.

"Don't cry, we've got your back!"
"Please teach dance classes, Susan!"

Meanwhile, Susan was heading to a new film set when a dark figure suddenly rushed toward her—
###Chapter 253: Susan and Alexander Caught in Secret Rendezvous

Susan stumbled backward from the unexpected impact.

She instinctively dodged to the side, but the assailant still grazed her arm sharply. A burning pain spread instantly.

"My bag!"

A shrill female voice pierced the air. Susan looked up into the heavily made-up face of Heidi Young—a famously statuesque beauty in the entertainment industry and close friend to Nicole Capra and Candy Wilson.

A pink handbag lay in the muddy slush, its surface ruined by melted snow and dirt, its contents scattered across the ground.

Out of the corner of her eye, Susan spotted two glamorous couples standing nearby. Nicole's wrist was still bandaged, and Candy's fingers were splinted, yet both women clung happily to their respective partners. Andrew Lucas and Vincent King stood tall in their tailored suits like twin sentinels.

"You hit me on purpose?!" Heidi's voice rose sharply. "This is a limited-edition LX bag! Only two exist in the world!"

Susan smirked. She recognized it immediately as a counterfeit—the stitching was too crude, and the hardware's finish was off.

"You're the one who bumped into me," Susan replied coolly. "If you're going to stage a scam, at least make it believable."

Heidi's face twisted. She yanked a staff member forward. "Tell me—who hit who?"

The young man lowered his head, voice trembling. "It... it was Ms. Thompson who bumped into Ms. Young."

Another voice chimed in. "We all saw it."

"Five million. Not a cent less!" Heidi held up five fingers triumphantly. "This was a love token from Zack Howard!"

Just as Susan was about to expose the lie, a warm hand closed around her wrist.

A silver mask gleamed coldly under the studio lights, but the violet eyes behind it burned with intensity. Alexander Grant stood in full costume—his broad shoulders and narrow waist perfectly accentuated by the guard's uniform.

Susan's breath hitched. Today's scene involved an imperial concubine caught in an affair with a palace guard.

And Alexander was clearly playing the "lover."

The set fell dead silent. Everyone recognized the heir to the Grant conglomerate—even Heidi froze mid-performance.

"My woman isn't yours to bully." Alexander's voice was calm, yet it dropped the temperature in the room.

He bent down, picking up the muddied bag. With a flick of his fingers, the inner label was exposed—clearly displaying the logo of a wholesale market.

"Five million?" He chuckled. "This isn't even worth five hundred."

Heidi paled. Nicole and Candy's expressions stiffened. Andrew narrowed his eyes while Vincent studied the "adulterous pair" with quiet interest.

Susan's ears burned. She hadn't expected Alexander to appear like this—let alone publicly claim their relationship.

The scene hadn't even started filming, yet their "affair" was already confirmed.
###Chapter 254: Get Susan Thompson Out of Showbiz!

Susan stood at the edge of the set, her fingers unconsciously twisting the hem of her costume. She never expected Director Cyrus would assign her this cameo role—an intimate scene with a palace guard.

"Susan! Are you deaf?" Heidi Young's shrill voice cut through the air. She stormed over in ten-inch heels, her perfectly made-up face twisted with malice. "Playing the innocent now? Feeling ashamed?"

Before Susan could respond, a strong masculine hand suddenly blocked her path. Alexander Grant wore a guard's mask, revealing only his sharply defined jawline.

"Back off!" Heidi sneered at Alexander's cheap costume. "Who does an extra think he is?"

"I'm her man." Alexander's voice was glacial.

The words made Andrew Lucas clench his fists nearby. Nicole Capra immediately noticed his tension and leaned against him weakly. "Andrew... she's already moved on so fast... She never loved you—"

"Shut up!" Andrew shoved her away, his dark eyes fixed on Susan and Alexander's intertwined hands.

Heidi dramatically waved her diamond ring. "Peasants! Do you know how much this bag costs? Can't pay? Then prepare for a lawsuit!"

Nicole chimed in sweetly, malice glinting in her eyes. "Sister, I could lend you the money—"

"Had enough acting?" Susan's laugh was icy. "This staged accident routine—four years and you're still using it?"

Commotion erupted as a slick-haired man barged in with bodyguards. "Who dares bully my girlfriend?"

Zack Howard's eyes bulged when he saw Susan. Heidi pinched him sharply, jolting him back to reality. He cleared his throat pompously. "Apologize and pay up now, or I'll erase you from Hollywood!"

Alexander chuckled darkly. He slowly removed his mask, revealing the face that commanded respect across the city.

"Erase my woman?" His gaze swept over Zack's suddenly ashen face. "Try me."

Dead silence fell. Heidi's purse hit the ground with a thud. Nicole's expression froze completely. Only Andrew remained, kicking over a chair in fury, his eyes burning with apocalyptic rage.
###Chapter 255: The Grant Heir is a Kept Man?

"Kneel!"

Susan Thompson frowned, her cold gaze sweeping over the slick-haired Zack Howard. A man who used counterfeit bags to chase women dared demand her submission?

Her fingers itched with the urge to smash that mud-stained fake purse right into his smug face.

Andrew Lucas's expression darkened dangerously. Though he resented Susan, seeing others bully her ignited something far more volatile.

"Who exactly won't survive in Southridge?" Alexander Grant's voice cut through the tension like a blade, laced with undeniable authority.

"This bitch!" Zack puffed his chest under Alexander's piercing stare, though his bravado wavered. "What? Playing white knight? Know your place!"

Heidi Young whispered, "Mr. Howard, he's Susan's boyfriend. A nobody in the industry."

Zack's smirk returned with a vengeance. He jabbed a finger at Alexander. "On your knees! Or say goodbye to your acting career!"

Susan nearly laughed aloud. Demanding the Grant heir to kneel? Zack must have a death wish.

"Me? Kneel?" Alexander's disdainful glance flicked to the filthy bag. "Extorting five million for counterfeit trash? What delusion fuels you?"

"Counterfeit?" Zack spluttered. "Open your damn eyes! This is LX's limited edition!"

Alexander adjusted his cufflinks. "Understandable you can't tell. LX would never produce such hideous designs. My designers would be fired for less."

"Your designers?" Zack barked a laugh. "What, are you Alexander Grant? Prove you're the Grant heir, and I'll kneel as your footstool!"

Patrick Pope arrived then, trailed by LX's design director Sean Stapleton.

Heidi brightened. "Director Stapleton! May I have your autograph?"

Sean ignored her, rushing to Alexander. "Sir, your instructions?"

"Sir?" Zack's grin froze. "Director, you're mistaken! He's just a trophy boyfriend!"

Dead silence engulfed them.

Sean's forehead gleamed with sweat. "Sir, pay no mind to this lunatic."

Zack's legs began trembling. This "trophy boyfriend"... was truly the Grant heir?
###Chapter 256: Alexander and Susan's Improper Relationship!

Alexander Grant's slender fingers lightly pinched Susan Thompson's fingertips, his lips curling into an amused smirk. "Being a kept man isn't so bad."

"After tonight's shoot, join me for late-night snacks."

Just as Susan opened her mouth to refuse, he decided for her. "That barbecue stall behind your high school."

She absentmindedly touched her empty stomach. Filming really took a lot out of her.

Andrew Lucas' face darkened dangerously. A kept man? Flirting right in front of him?

Vincent King watched coldly, his knuckles turning white. This venomous woman had truly mastered the art of seduction.

Alexander suddenly turned to Sean Stapleton. "That bag on the ground—your limited edition design?"

Following his gaze, Sean nearly jumped out of his skin. "Boss! How dare they slap our LX logo on this trash? Look at this cheap leather! These crooked stitches! The counterfeiters didn't even try!"

Mocking laughter rippled across the set.

Heidi Young turned deathly pale. The "half-million-dollar limited edition" she'd been flaunting turned out to be fake.

"Zack Howard!" she shrieked. "You swore this was authentic!"

Zack broke out in a cold sweat. With his family drowning in debt, where would he get money for real luxury bags?

"I... I got it through a friend..." he stammered.

Patrick Pope stepped forward leisurely, reciting a string of numbers. "Howard Group liabilities: 35.1 billion. Personal debts of Zack Mingxian..."

Zack's legs gave out, collapsing to his knees. The Grant heir was about to turn his family estate into a pig farm!

"Miss Thompson! My mistake!" He yanked Heidi forward. "Apologize now!"

Heidi pouted her chest, batting her lashes at Alexander. "Mr. Grant, I really did get hurt when she bumped into me..."

Alexander's face twisted in disgust. "Last chance. Who hit whom?"

The false witness immediately changed his tune. "Heidi crashed into Miss Thompson!"

"Apologize." Alexander's voice could freeze hell.

Zack forcibly pushed Heidi's head into a bow.

Director Cyrus' voice called for filming to resume. Alexander pulled Susan toward the set.

In the makeup room, Susan's face burned hotter as she read the script. Forced kisses. Bed scenes. Non-consensual advances... The scenes were far too explicit!

She suddenly wanted to flee.
###Chapter 257 Susan Thompson's Absolute Domination

Susan's fingers trembled as she clutched the script. The further she read, the hotter her cheeks burned.

She was about to discuss script changes with Director Cyrus when footsteps echoed at the door.

Andrew Lucas, Nicole Capra, Vincent King, and Candy Wilson filed in.

Andrew held an identical script, his knuckles turning white.

A mocking smirk curled his lips, but his eyes were cold as ice, piercing through Susan.

Vincent frowned, his gaze dark and unreadable as it swept over the script's contents.

Susan tightened her grip on her clothes.

Even though they'd broken up, she couldn't film this kind of scene in front of Andrew.

"Director," she said, her voice strained, "this scene might be..."

"Susan!" Director Cyrus cut her off. "You promised me! No one else can play Consort Young!"

Susan gave a bitter smile. "But it's just a cameo..."

"Do you know who Consort Young is?" The director waved his arms excitedly. "The most beautiful woman in the Rong Kingdom! A minor role that outshines everyone!"

He pointed at Nicole and Candy. "They're playing the female leads, but you're the only one in the entire industry who can overshadow them!"

Nicole's smile froze.

Candy's face darkened as she tugged Vincent's sleeve. "Vincent, he just called me ugly..."

Vincent absentmindedly hummed in response.

Candy looked as if she'd been struck by lightning.

Behind them, Patrick Pope burst into laughter. "Mr. King's brutally honest."

Candy trembled with rage.

Seeing Susan still hesitating, Director Cyrus resorted to blackmail. "If you don't do it, I'm cutting ties with you!"

Susan massaged her temples in resignation.

She glanced at the two statues by the door. "Then... can we clear the set?"

"Hah." Andrew scoffed. "Now you're shy?"

Susan's chest tightened.

Taking a deep breath, she turned to Alexander Grant. "I'm ready."

The set fell silent.

Everyone held their breath, waiting for the drama to unfold.
###Chapter 258: Andrew's Head Turns Emerald Green

Alexander Grant closed the script with a light tap of his fingers on the cover. Patrick Pope immediately hunched forward, hands outstretched to receive it, resembling an ancient eunuch attending to his master.

Director Cyrus was about to call "Action" when a sudden chill ran down his spine. Despite the high temperature in the studio, an icy sensation crept along his back as if a blade had grazed his vertebrae.

Susan Thompson took a deep breath. On the surface, this scene depicted an affair, but in reality, it was just camera angles. She played Consort Young, a woman consumed by love-turned-hatred, determined to cuckold the emperor by seducing his most trusted guard.

"Action!"

Susan instantly slipped into character. Seated on the intricately carved bed, her heavily made-up face radiated venom. Gem-studded nails dug into her palms as her crimson lips parted:

"If your heart belongs only to the dead, why should I remain trapped in this lonely palace? Today, I, Nina Young, will make you the laughingstock of history!"

Alexander was escorted in by two eunuchs, a silver mask concealing half his face.

"Dismissed," Susan commanded with a flick of her wide sleeve.

Once the attendants retreated, she abruptly closed the distance between them. Her lacquered fingernail lifted his chin. "Guard Liam? The emperor's right-hand man?"

Behind the mask, his lips thinned. "Your Highness, maintain your dignity."

"Dignity?" Susan scoffed before shoving him against the wall. The clash of ornate robes against armor rang through the set.

As Alexander struggled, she spun and pinned him onto the bed. Silk covers billowed like waves as she leaned in, her lips hovering a breath away from his—

"Hmph."

Andrew Lucas's mocking laugh sliced through the studio.

Susan's lashes fluttered, but she pressed on, sealing the scripted kiss. The moment their lips met, Alexander's eyes darkened. In one swift motion, he flipped her beneath him.

"Cut!" Director Cyrus suddenly shouted.

Susan scrambled out from under Alexander. "Director, was something wrong?"

"It was perfect!" Cyrus gushed, waving his hands excitedly. "But I have a better idea! Susan, you can dance, right? Use your movements to seduce him, then let him lose control and grab your waist—"

The tips of Susan's ears burned scarlet. Though it was just camera angles, the thought of simulating such intimacy with Alexander in front of the crew made her fingers tingle with heat.

"Like this—" Cyrus grabbed Alexander to demonstrate, "tease him until he can't resist—"

"Hmph."

Andrew's derisive snort cut through again. Only then did Cyrus notice the glowering figure in the corner. "Mr. Lucas, is your throat bothering you?"

The set fell dead silent. Andrew stared at Susan's flushed cheeks, his grip on the water bottle producing ominous creaks.

She used to dance only for him. Her snow-white toes would barely graze the floor, her waist supple as willow branches in spring. Now, she was about to perform like this for another man...

Andrew felt his head turning a shade of green bright enough to host a horse race.
###Chapter 259: Susan, I'm Getting Married!

Nicole's nails dug deep into her palms.

She glared at Susan standing at the center of the film set, her meticulously made-up face twisting with barely contained rage.

How could this disfigured woman still make Andrew lose control?

"Andrew, your throat..." she cooed, attempting to salvage the situation.

"Shut up."

Andrew shook off her hand, his gaze icy.

The set fell into terrifying silence.

Director Cyrus wiped sweat from his brow, forcing an uneasy smile. "Mr. Lucas, this scene is necessary for the plot—"

"Necessary for what?" Andrew sneered. "Necessary to flaunt yourself in public?"

Susan clenched the hem of her costume.

She met his gaze squarely. "Mr. Lucas, this is artistic expression."

"Art?" His eyes raked over her exposed shoulders, his Adam's apple bobbing. "You call this art?"

Vincent suddenly stepped forward. "Mr. Lucas, investors have the right to suggest script changes."

The two men locked eyes, tension crackling between them.

Alexander gently rested a hand on Susan's shoulder. "Her foot injury hasn't fully healed. We'll reschedule this scene."

Susan froze.

She hadn't expected Alexander to remember such a detail.

"How touching." Andrew suddenly laughed coldly. "How considerate of you, Mr. Grant."

He turned on his heel and strode away, Nicole scrambling after him.

The set remained deathly quiet.

Director Cyrus wiped his forehead. "Then today we'll shoot—"

"Continue." Susan's voice cut through the silence.

She refused to let Andrew's interference delay production.

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "Sure?"

"Yes." She took a deep breath. "One take."

When Alexander pressed her down onto the bed, Susan could hear her own heartbeat pounding in her ears.

"Cut!"

The moment the director called it, she practically sprang up.

By the time she finished removing her makeup, it was already midnight.

As Susan exited the studio, she saw the familiar Rolls-Royce idling outside.

"Get in." Alexander rolled down the window.

The night breeze carried a slight chill.

An awkward silence filled the car.

"What brings you to this cameo role, Mr. Grant?" Susan attempted small talk.

"You."

The single word made the air between them freeze.

Susan's ears burned.

Alexander suddenly turned to face her. "That moment earlier... felt different."

Heat exploded across Susan's face.

The driver's hands jerked on the wheel, causing the car to lurch.

Fortunately, her apartment building soon came into view.

Susan practically fled from the vehicle.

But when she pushed open her front door, she froze.

Andrew sat on her couch, his expression dark.

"Having fun?" he sneered.

Susan gripped the doorknob. "Get out."

"The eighteenth of next month." He stood slowly, enunciating each word. "Nicole and I are getting married."

He stepped closer until his breath fanned her face. "Happy now?"
###Chapter 260: Farewell, Mr. Lucas

They were getting married.

Susan Thompson's fingers turned white as she clenched the medicine bottle. Even though she had resolved to cut ties with Andrew Lucas long ago, the news still pierced her heart like a blade.

The eighteenth of next month—only twenty-eight days away.

Her lips curled into a faint, bitter smile. "Was it really necessary for you to come all this way just to tell me, Mr. Lucas?"

"Who you marry is none of my concern." She lifted her chin. "Even if it's a dog."

"Leave the key." She held out her palm. "Breaking and entering is a crime."

Dark emotions churned in Andrew's eyes. Ever since that night, he hadn't slept properly.

How could she act so unaffected?

"Did you seduce Alexander Grant for Henry Bartley?" He shoved her against the door. "Aren't you afraid the truth will come out?"

"The truth?" Susan laughed coldly. "Your version of the truth has always come from Nicole Capra."

"At least Alexander was willing to hear me out."

Andrew's gaze turned to ice. "In your eyes, is everyone better than me?"

"Yes." Her voice was barely a whisper. "You disappointed me the most."

"Then let's part ways for good."

Those words ignited his fury. He crushed his lips against hers, the taste of blood blooming between them.

"Nicole won't mind." His voice dripped with sarcasm. "She's so generous."

Susan suddenly coughed violently, blood seeping through her fingers and staining his white shirt.

"Hospital!" He panicked, trying to wipe it away.

"Don't bother." She pushed him back. "Even if I die, it's none of your business."

Andrew froze. As the cold wind rushed in from the hallway, he heard himself say, "A woman like you—the world would be better off without you."

When he turned away, something warm trailed down his cheek.
###Chapter 261: Susan's Deadly Trap

Andrew's ears echoed with Susan's words.

"Mr. Lucas, you're pathetic."

The elevator doors slid shut. His fists clenched, knuckles turning white.

Susan leaned against her apartment door, chest heaving. She pulled out a pill bottle, shook out a black tablet, and swallowed it dry.

Her phone rang sharply.

"Ms. Thompson, Nicole Capra will be at the Imperial Hotel tonight at eight," the private detective said excitedly. "Room 1808. Director Zachary Quinn's suite."

A cold smile curled Susan's lips.

She opened her notebook and quickly jotted down Bianca Quinn's number. The director's wife was notorious—last year, she'd publicly stripped a starlet naked.

The clock struck 7:30.

Susan changed into a black trench coat and pulled on a baseball cap. In the mirror, her eyes gleamed like ice.

Imperial Hotel underground garage.

Nicole stepped out of her van, scanning the area warily. Jenny Keene handed her a keycard. "The director said the script's waiting in his room."

"The press is handled?"

"Relax. This hotel's discreet."

The elevator ascended to the 18th floor. Nicole touched up her lipstick and pushed open the door.

Zachary was already waiting. His greasy hands grabbed her waist. "Darling, this lead role has your name on it."

Meanwhile, Susan dialed Bianca's number.

"Mrs. Quinn, room 1808 at the Imperial. Your husband's entertaining a certain A-list actress right now."

A glass shattered on the other end.

"You'd better not be lying."

Susan hung up, watching from the café across the street. She opened her phone's camera, zooming in on 1808's window.

8:20 PM.

Three black SUVs screeched to a halt at the hotel entrance. Bianca stormed in with a dozen hulking bodyguards—followed by eight paparazzi crews.

When the door burst open, camera flashes lit up the room.

Nicole's scream pierced the hallway.

Susan stopped recording and sipped her coffee. Her phone buzzed—the detective's message: "Video uploaded to all major platforms."

Trending lists exploded instantly.

#NicoleCapraCastingCouch
#ZacharyQuinnAffair
#LucasFianceeScandal

Susan watched the view counts climb, satisfaction flickering in her eyes.

Top floor of Lucas Corporation.

Andrew's phone blew up with notifications. He frowned at the screen—Nicole's disheveled photo filled the display.

"Impossible!" He stood abruptly, papers scattering.

His assistant timidly offered a tablet. "Sir, the livestream is still going..."

On screen, Bianca slammed Nicole's head against the wall. Paparazzi lenses captured every detail.

Andrew grabbed his car keys, face stormy.

Back at her apartment, Susan turned on the TV. Every channel covered the scandal.

Water ran in the bathroom.

She studied her reflection—color finally returning to her pale face.

"This is just the beginning, Nicole."
###Chapter 262: Nicole Capra's Humiliation!

Director Zachary Quinn was undeniably charismatic.

His tall frame carried an air of sophistication.

Though nearing fifty, his well-maintained physique spared him the typical middle-aged man's greasiness.

More importantly, his status and talent in the entertainment industry made him irresistible to countless starlets.

Nicole felt no affection for him—only the promise of resources and benefits made the arrangement worthwhile.

As they lost themselves in pleasure, the doorbell suddenly rang with urgent insistence.

Zachary frowned, assuming it was hotel staff, and waved dismissively.

Just as he was about to continue, the ringing escalated into violent pounding.

"Zachary Quinn! Open this door!"

At the sound of that voice, his face drained of color.

He shoved Nicole away, scrambling for his clothes in panic.

Before she could react, the door burst open with a crash.

Bianca Quinn stormed in with three formidable women, a gleaming axe clutched in her hand.

"Director Quinn, what's happening?" Nicole complained, irritated.

Only when she saw the intruders did she grasp the severity of the situation.

Bianca took in the scene before her, fury blazing in her eyes.

She raised the axe, teeth clenched. "Zachary, you cheating bastard!"

Nicole trembled violently, her mind blank with terror.

Zachary, thinking fast, pointed at Nicole and shouted, "Honey, she seduced me!"

Nicole stared at him in disbelief—the same man who had whispered sweet nothings moments ago.

Regret flooded her, but it was too late.

Bianca smirked and nodded to her companions.

Two women seized Nicole while the others pulled out their phones and began snapping photos.

"No!" Nicole thrashed desperately but was no match for their strength.

She tried to cover herself with the sheets, only for them to be yanked away.

"Homewrecker dares to fight back?" One woman slapped her hard across the face.

Another grabbed her hair and slammed her head against the bedframe.

Zachary cowered in the corner, not daring to breathe.

Bianca raised the axe and advanced on Nicole, snarling, "Today, I rid the world of this scourge!"

Nicole squeezed her eyes shut, bracing for the inevitable.
###Chapter 263: Nicole Capra's Downfall Goes Viral!

The cold glint of the axe blade froze Nicole's blood in her veins.

She watched in horror as the sharp blade grazed her arm and embedded deep into the mattress. Cold sweat drenched her back. Her legs trembled uncontrollably.

"Aaaah—"

After the scream, Nicole realized with mortification that she'd wet herself. Warm liquid trickled down her thighs. Humiliation burned through her, but her body had betrayed her.

"Film this! Get all of it!" Bianca's friends excitedly raised their phones. Camera flashes lit up the room like strobe lights.

Nicole curled into a ball, desperate to hide her disgrace. But two burly women pinned her wrists down, rendering her helpless.

"You slut!" Bianca yanked her hair. "Daring to seduce my husband?"

"I didn't!" Tears streamed down Nicole's face. "I was framed! Director Zachary can vouch for me!"

She turned pleading eyes toward the cowering director, only to hear him disavow her immediately. "You drugged me! I was drunk and remember nothing!"

Nicole shook with rage. This old man had been whispering sweet nothings moments ago, yet now threw her under the bus.

Slap!

Bianca's palm struck hard. Blood seeped from Nicole's split lip.

"Playing innocent now?" Bianca sneered. "After all that moaning earlier?"

The women descended like vultures, nails carving bloody trails across Nicole's skin. She covered her face and wailed, "Please don't hit my face! I admit I was wrong!"

"Wrong?" Bianca grabbed a crystal ashtray. "Let me teach you what wrong really means."

Crash!

White-hot pain exploded through Nicole's jaw. A tooth flew from her mouth with a spray of blood. Curled into a fetal position, she sobbed uncontrollably, tears and snot smearing her ruined face.

"Wait!" someone gasped. "Isn't that Nicole Capra? The actress?"

The assault paused as they examined her swollen, distorted features.

"It's really her! Andrew Lucas's fiancée!"

Malicious glee flashed in Bianca's eyes. "Post the video online. Let the world see their 'Pure Goddess' for what she really is."

Nicole squeezed her eyes shut. She knew—her life was over.
###Chapter 264: Nicole Capra, Disgusting and Pathetic!

"Stop!" Nicole's voice was hoarse as she screamed. Blood mixed with tears streamed down her face, leaving her in a pitiful state.

She had never been so terrified before.

Physical pain was bearable, but once her reputation was ruined, there was no going back.

The most damning evidence was the fake scar on her abdomen. That mark made it impossible to deny the woman in the video was her.

"Please, sisters..." Nicole trembled as she clutched the woman's sleeve. "If this gets out, my life is over!"

Sobbing uncontrollably, she begged, "I know I was wrong! I'll change! Just give me one chance, please!"

"Did you think about the consequences when you were playing homewrecker?" The woman yanked her arm away in disgust. "A bitch like you deserves to be torn apart!"

"Andrew Lucas must be blind!" Another woman kicked her hard in the face.

Nicole spat out a mouthful of blood, her hair sticking to the grime, making her look revolting.

"Post that video online now!" the woman snapped. "Let everyone see the true face of this green tea bitch!"

"Especially Andrew Lucas—he needs to see what kind of snake she really is!"

"No!" Nicole suddenly shrieked. "I'll pay you! A million each!"

Desperation laced her voice. "What's done is done. Ruining me won't benefit you either..."

"Disgusting!" Hannah Green spat in her face. "You think we want your dirty money?"

She flashed the Patek Philippe on her wrist. "Take a good look. Do we look like we need your pocket change?"

Nicole trembled violently. She had always believed money could solve anything, but now she'd hit a wall.

As seconds ticked by, she slowly regained her composure.

If begging didn't work...

"You know who I am," Nicole suddenly straightened her back. "I'm Victor Thompson's daughter. Andrew Lucas's fiancée."

A ruthless glint flashed in her eyes. "If you touch me, you'll never survive in Seaview City!"

Hannah froze mid-motion.

Even Jade Smith, who had been uploading the video, paused.

Nicole knew her threat had landed.

"Delete the video and apologize to me," she wrapped the sheet tighter around herself, lifting her chin. "Or I'll make sure you rot in prison!"

Director Zachary Quinn stumbled over, hastily buttoning his shirt. "Bianca, we can't afford to mess with the Thompsons..."

He pleaded, "For the sake of my career, just let her go."
###Chapter 265: Trampled by Thousands

Director Zachary's words still hung in the air when Nicole Capra lifted her chin.

She sat on the bed like a proud peacock, waiting to watch Bianca Quinn and the others grovel in humiliation.

Some might resist money, but who would dare gamble their future against power?

Nicole was certain of her victory.

"Disgusting!"

Bianca spat directly in her face.

"A homewrecker with this much audacity? Do you really think the Lucas family would want trash like you? Once those shameful photos spread online, let's see if Andrew Lucas still wants you!"

"Even if Andrew were blind, the Lucas family wouldn't tolerate this disgrace!"

"Mr. Thompson despises homewreckers who destroy families!"

Bianca yanked the bedsheet off Nicole.

Her sharp nails left bloody scratches on Nicole's face.

"My face!" Nicole shrieked.

The other women surged forward, adding more crimson streaks to her skin.

Director Zachary turned away, afraid of getting burned.

"The video's uploaded!" Jade Smith waved her phone excitedly. "Views are skyrocketing! Nicole, you're about to go viral!"

Nicole trembled violently.

It was over.

Those unspeakable images would forever brand her with shame.

After unleashing their fury, Bianca and the others dragged Zachary away, leaving Nicole behind.

Nicole collapsed on the bed like a dying fish.

Tears mixed with blood rolled down her cheeks.

Her phone lay at her feet, but she didn't dare check the storm raging online.

Her shaking fingers accidentally tapped a notification:

"Pure Goddess Nicole Capra's Affair Exposed!"

The comments section exploded:

"This is the same Nicole who 'sold her kidney to save her husband'? Disgusting!"

"Andrew Lucas must have a whole forest growing on his head by now!"

"Someone should dump manure on this bitch!"

"Hahaha look at her pissing herself in fear!"

Nicole hurled her phone across the room.

She bit her lip so hard blood dripped from her chin.

She couldn't just wait for death!

Henry Bartley—she needed to find Henry!

Her phone suddenly vibrated.

Henry's furious roar erupted from the speaker:

"Nicole! You lied to me!"

"You said you only loved me! Why were you in Zachary Quinn's bed?!"

Nicole clenched the bedsheet, her nails digging deep into her palms.
###Chapter 266: Ready to Walk Through Fire for Her

"Nicole Capra, I've given you my heart!" Henry Bartley's eyes burned crimson, his voice hoarse with fury.

"I've done everything for you these years. Is this how you repay me?"

Nicole had never seen Henry like this. The man she remembered was always docile as a lamb, but now he roared like an enraged lion.

Her nails dug into her palms until crescent marks formed. Swallowing her anger, she summoned tears that spilled instantly.

"Henry, you're wrong about me..." Her voice trembled violently.

"I admit my past mistakes, but this time—it wasn't my choice!"

"Zachary Quinn drugged me!" Nicole sobbed pitifully. "When I woke up, I was already... already..."

The veins on Henry's phone-clutching hand bulged. The video footage tortured him, yet her swollen red eyes melted his resolve.

"Swear it," he rasped.

"I swear!" Nicole threw herself against his chest. "How could that old man compare to you? Why would I ever—"

Her words pleased him. He inhaled deeply, gently patting her back.

"When I reached the bar, it was too late..." Nicole hiccuped between sobs. "His wife stormed in with her friends, called me a homewrecker... They beat me, even..."

She rolled up her sleeve, revealing horrific bruises. Henry's pupils contracted, his heart aching beyond measure.

"The whole internet hates me..." Nicole hyperventilated through tears. "But I'm the victim here!"

Henry fully relented. Cradling her face, he wiped her tears. "Don't be afraid. I'm here."

"How can you protect me?" Nicole suddenly shoved him away. "My life is over! Just let me die!"

She feigned a dash toward the wall. Henry seized her in a desperate embrace.

"I'll fix this!" His voice shook. "Even if it costs my life, I'll help you!"

Nicole smirked against his shoulder, though her voice remained broken. "There's only one way now..."

Lifting tearful eyes, she studied the man enslaved by her charms. The fish had taken the bait.
###Chapter 267: His Heart Ached for Susan

The Koenigsegg's interior was warm, but Andrew Lucas felt no comfort.

His long fingers gripped the steering wheel, knuckles turning white.

Since parting with Susan, it was as if he lived in perpetual winter. No coat could chase away the bone-deep chill.

The image of Susan coughing up blood haunted him.

He slammed the wheel in frustration.

That cruel woman deserved to suffer—yet he knew all too well the agony of a bleeding stomach.

She'd always feared pain.

A mere pinprick used to make her whimper for hours. How much was she hurting now?

Andrew abruptly turned the car around.

He told himself he was only going back to ensure she didn't die too easily.

The car sped through the night.

He dialed Susan's number. At least he could hear her voice first.

——

Susan curled on the sofa, scrolling through news clips.

Nicole Capra's humiliating video had her laughing uncontrollably.

The comments were even better than the footage.

"Nicole wet herself like a toddler. Does she pee the bed when sleeping with Andrew too?"

The user "PlainYear" was downright savage.

Her phone rang.

Seeing Andrew's name, she assumed it was about returning keys and answered absently.

"Hahaha—"

She couldn't stop giggling.

Andrew's grip on his phone tightened.

His rehearsed concern lodged in his throat.

She was... laughing?

"Susan!" he growled through clenched teeth.

She rolled her eyes.

Calling just to yell at her at this hour?

"Mr. Lucas, I know my own name," she said coldly. "Mail the keys back. I don't want to see you."

Click.

Satisfaction.

Andrew stared at the black screen, tempted to hurl his phone.

Then he remembered her old, spirited laugh and his lips twitched upward.

Immediately, he punched the steering wheel in self-disgust.

He was losing his mind.

Glancing at the time—well past midnight—he meant to return to Willow Lane.

Yet somehow, the car pulled up to Benjamin Nash's courtyard.

He entered the code and ascended the familiar stairs.

Daniel's door was ajar.

Moonlight spilled across the sleeping boy's face.

His blanket lay discarded on the floor.

Andrew frowned.

However insincere this mother and son were toward him, the sight still stung.
###Chapter 268: The Pain of Abandonment

Daniel wore only thin pajama pants.

The flimsy fabric clung to his skin, offering little protection against the cold despite the heater running.

He was alarmingly thin—his loose pant legs barely concealed the sharp angles of his bones.

His small face had lost its softness, now all sharp edges, and his fragile frame looked especially pitiful lying in bed.

His leg was still injured.

His body was far weaker than most children's.

Yet his intelligence and maturity surpassed his peers.

Andrew Lucas's lips curved unconsciously at the memory of Daniel effortlessly outshining other kids at kindergarten.

But the smile froze when he recalled the boy calling him "monster" with those accusing eyes.

He forced himself to turn away, refusing to look at the child any longer.

That vile woman and her crippled son didn’t deserve his concern.

Even if the boy froze to death, what was it to him?

Andrew strode toward the door.

But he paused at the staircase.

Finally, he turned back.

Bending down, he picked up the fallen blanket.

With clumsy yet gentle movements, he draped it over Daniel, carefully tucking the edges around him.

His fingers accidentally brushed the child’s warm cheek.

No matter how harsh his words, he still loved Susan Thompson.

And their son.

His eyes burned suddenly. The man known for his ruthlessness now felt as helpless as an abandoned child.

Outwardly strong, his heart was riddled with wounds.

Severe psychological illness made him sensitive and fragile.

The ones he loved most could hurt him the deepest.

"Susan… Daniel…"

His throat tightened in a voiceless whisper.

"You’ve both left me."

After one last glance at the sleeping boy, he walked away, his silhouette bleak.

The moment he returned to his villa at Shallow Bay, his phone rang.

The caller ID made his pupils constrict.

Henry Bartley.

The man who had taken Susan from him.

"Impressive memory, Andrew. You still have my number," came the mocking voice.

"What do you want?" Andrew’s tone was glacial.

"Heard Nicole Capra got caught cheating at a hotel tonight?" Henry’s laugh dripped malice. "The video’s gone viral."

Andrew’s grip on the phone tightened.

"I spiked her drink and personally delivered her to Zachary Quinn’s bed." Henry lowered his voice. "This is what happens to those who hurt Susan."

After the call ended, Andrew immediately checked the news.

Footage of Nicole in disarray topped the trending list.

The comments were vile.

He dialed five times before she answered.

"Andrew—" Her voice was ragged with sobs. "Let’s call off the engagement… I’m not worthy of you anymore—"

"Don’t do anything reckless." His voice was strained. "I’ll handle it."

"But I’m tainted—"

"The wedding proceeds as planned." The promise was mechanical. "You’ll get justice."

Hanging up, Andrew stood motionless before the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Strangely, seeing his fiancée’s scandal didn’t spark betrayal or rage—just numb obligation.

He grabbed his car keys, ready to confront Susan.

But as he started the engine, her words echoed:

"You always believe others’ lies but never my truth."

His hands froze on the steering wheel.

What if… this was another misunderstanding?

"Pull the hotel surveillance," he ordered his assistant. "I need to know if Nicole entered that room willingly—or if she was drugged."
###Chapter 269: Let Victor Destroy Susan!

Leo Miller was having a sweet dream, hugging a pillow that had transformed into a stunning beauty in his sleep. Just as he was about to act, his phone rang abruptly.

The caller ID showed "Boss."

He jolted awake, all drowsiness gone.

"Yes, Boss! I'll investigate immediately!"

After hanging up, Leo dove into work. Within half an hour, he called Andrew Lucas again.

"Boss..." Leo's voice trembled. "Tonight's hotel surveillance footage was completely wiped. The tech team said... unless Mr. Ryan Lucas personally intervenes..."

The other end of the line was terrifyingly silent.

After checking the news, Leo realized his boss had been publicly cuckolded. He swallowed hard and cautiously asked, "Boss... are you okay?"

Still no response.

Leo imagined Andrew weeping alone and felt heartbroken. "Boss, everyone faces setbacks in life—"

The call disconnected abruptly.

Panicked, Leo grabbed his car keys and rushed out, fearing his boss might do something drastic.

Meanwhile, Andrew stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, his eyes dark and stormy.

He tried calling Ryan Lucas, but the line was dead. From Victoria Lucas, he learned his eldest brother had gone to a remote island with no communication.

It would take at least two weeks for Ryan to return.

Andrew clenched his phone.

The destroyed footage meant only two possibilities: either Susan Thompson and Henry Bartley were responsible, or Nicole Capra had done it herself.

Considering Henry's earlier phone call, he leaned toward the former.

Yet he still wanted to give Susan a chance.

Even if it was just self-deception.

"Andrew Lucas, you're truly pathetic," he mocked himself with a bitter smile.

At the hotel, Nicole hung up the phone and exhaled in relief.

Despite her tarnished image, Andrew still wanted to marry her.

That was enough.

Facing the mirror, she dipped her fingers in water and smeared the blood at the corner of her lips. Then she put on sunglasses and a mask before leaving the hotel fully disguised.

Victor Thompson was tending to Catherine Capra in the bedroom when he heard the maid's startled cry downstairs.

"Miss Nicole! Put down that knife!"

He hurried downstairs and froze at the sight of Nicole's blood-streaked face.

"Nicole! Who did this to you?"

Nicole threw herself into his arms, sobbing hysterically. "Dad... it was Susan... she ruined me..."

Victor's expression darkened like storm clouds.

As she imagined the impending revenge on Susan, Nicole slowly curled her lips into a cold smile—hidden safely from her father's view.
###Chapter 270: Nicole Demands Blood for Blood

Nicole's hand trembled as she gripped the kitchen knife, its blade glinting coldly under the light. Two maids clung to her arms, their nails digging into her flesh.

"Dad!" Nicole's wail rose sharply at the sound of footsteps. She suddenly raised the knife toward her throat, the blade grazing her skin and leaving a thin trail of blood.

The maids shrieked and lunged forward. The knife clattered to the floor.

Victor rushed forward in three strides, kicking the blade away. He seized his daughter's wrist, his voice shaking. "Nicole! Have you lost your mind?"

"Let me die!" Nicole thrashed hysterically. "I'm ruined! The whole world knows what happened to me!" Her legs gave out, and she collapsed, her nails scraping the floor with a screech.

The housekeeper hurriedly snatched up the knife and hid it in the kitchen. When she returned, Nicole was slamming her head against the wall. Blood trickled down her pale cheeks, mingling with tears and staining her silk nightgown.

Victor pulled his daughter into his arms, his palm brushing against the sharp protrusion of her shoulder blades. The realization stabbed through his heart—when had his precious girl become so gaunt?

"Who did this?" Victor's voice was laced with ice. He stroked her tangled hair, his fingers coming away sticky with blood.

Nicole suddenly convulsed violently. "It was Susan... She drugged me..." She clutched her father's collar, her nails sinking into the expensive fabric. "She hired men to rape me and posted the video online!"

The living room fell deathly silent. The maids kept their heads bowed, listening to the sound of Victor's knuckles cracking.

"Just now, she called..." Nicole let out a shrill, unnatural laugh. "She said I'll never have Andrew... That I'll never be clean again..."

Victor shot to his feet. His suit jacket brushed against the coffee table, knocking over a glass that shattered on the floor. He pulled out his phone. The hashtag #NicoleCapraHomewrecker trended with a blazing red "BREAKING" beside it.

The video of his disheveled daughter made his vision darken.

"Dad, there's more..." Nicole staggered upright, lifting her nightgown to reveal a scar on her abdomen. "She killed my baby..." She raised her left wrist, where a gruesome wound still oozed blood. "I should have died last time..."

Victor's pupils constricted. That scar—he knew it too well. Twenty years ago, Catherine had left the same mark when she took her own life.

"She won't even spare Mom..." Nicole suddenly buried her face in her father's chest. "Dad, if Mom wakes up and sees me like this..."

Those words were the final straw. Victor gently pushed her away. When he turned, his eyes burned with murderous rage. He grabbed the car keys from the foyer, the metal biting into his palm.

"Wait here." His voice was terrifyingly soft. "Daddy will make this right."

The moment the door slammed shut, Nicole wiped her face. She stared at the blood on her fingers, then slowly smiled. By sunrise, Susan would be lying in the morgue.
###Chapter 271: Father and Daughter Confrontation

Susan Thompson slept peacefully through the night.

A faint smile lingered on her lips after ending the call with Andrew Lucas. Watching Nicole Capra being torn apart online brought her immense satisfaction.

Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains as she stretched, feeling refreshed.

After a quick wash, she scrolled through her phone while eating breakfast. To her surprise, the scandal surrounding Nicole had vanished without a trace overnight.

She smirked. Andrew had intervened, as expected.

At the press conference, Andrew stood rigidly before the cameras in a tailored suit, his voice icy and resolute. "Ms. Capra was drugged and framed. The mastermind behind this has already been apprehended."

The camera panned to Nicole, who clung to him with tearful eyes. Andrew gripped her hand firmly, his voice low and unwavering. "Our wedding date remains unchanged. No matter what happens, she will always be the love of my life."

Susan stared at the screen, her heart pricked by invisible needles.

This man never changed. No matter how despicable Nicole's actions were, he would always stand by her without hesitation.

"Let this be my final warning," the man on screen declared, his gaze sharp as blades. "Anyone who dareslander my fiancée will face the full wrath of the Lucas Group."

Susan turned off the video and laughed bitterly.

Perfect. A blind fool and a venomous snake—truly a match made in heaven.

Though Andrew's intervention had salvaged some damage, Nicole's reputation was beyond repair. Her fanbase was in shambles, and brands were dropping her left and right.

A cold glint flashed in Susan's eyes as she read the updates.

This wasn't enough.

She checked the time—still over an hour before her acting class. As she gathered her things to leave, two black-suited bodyguards blocked her path downstairs.

"Ms. Thompson, Mr. Thompson wishes to see you."

"Which Mr. Thompson?" She took a wary step back.

"Victor Thompson, Chairman of Thompson Group."

Her heart lurched. Her biological father.

Tears threatened to spill, but she forced them down. How many nights had she longed to see her parents? But now...

The guards' cold expressions told her everything. Victor was here to seek justice for Nicole.

"Sorry, I have somewhere to be—"

Before she could finish, the guards seized her arms. The car door slammed shut, and the engine roared as they sped toward the Thompson mansion.

The sunlight was blinding. In the courtyard, Victor stood with his back to her, radiating an aura of chilling fury.
###Chapter 272: The Shattering Truth

The bodyguard pushed open the door to reveal Victor Thompson standing by the floor-to-ceiling window.

Sunlight streamed through the glass, casting sharp shadows around his tall, imposing figure. His deep-set eyes held a piercing intensity forged by time.

"Mr. Thompson, we've brought her."

The moment Susan Thompson was shoved into the room, her breath caught.

Twenty years.

This was the first time she'd seen her biological father this close. His face bore a striking resemblance to Ethan Sullivan's, yet it was twisted with unmistakable disgust directed at her.

"Do you know why you're here?"

Victor's voice was glacial, each word like a knife to Susan's heart.

Her fingers clenched the hem of her shirt, nails digging into her palms.

"Is this about Nicole?"

"How dare you say her name!" Victor whirled around, fury blazing in his eyes. "My daughter is lying in a hospital bed right now. The doctors say her mental state is on the verge of collapse!"

Susan's lashes trembled slightly.

How ironic.

Her own father was demanding justice for another girl—the one who had stolen everything that should have been hers.

"Mr. Thompson, have you ever considered..." Susan lifted her gaze to meet his. "That you might have the wrong daughter?"

The air turned to ice.

Victor's expression darkened dangerously. "What are you implying?"

"I suggest you run another paternity test." Her voice was soft but razor-sharp. "Using Nicole's blood this time, not her hair."

"Preposterous!" Victor seized her chin with bruising force. "Do you really think such a pathetic attempt to sow discord would work?"

Pain blurred Susan's vision, but she forced the words out. "Twenty years ago, the Thompson family adopted a girl from the orphanage—"

"Silence!"

Victor released her abruptly. Susan staggered back, colliding with the wall.

She watched as he pulled out his phone and dialed a number. "Bring it in."

When the door opened again, Susan's stomach dropped at the sight of the surgical glinting on the tray.

"Since you enjoy hurting Nicole so much..." Victor methodically pulled on gloves. "You'll experience exactly what she endured."

Susan's pupils contracted.

It wasn't the pain she feared.

It was the truth being buried forever.

"Dad..."

The word slipped out before she could stop it. Victor froze.

"What did you just call me?"

Susan gave a bitter smile. "Nothing. I just hope... you won't regret this decision later."

As the cold blade touched her wrist, Susan closed her eyes.

She heard Victor's merciless command: "Do it."

White-hot agony erupted—

And then the door burst open with a crash.

"STOP!"

A familiar figure rushed into the room.
###Chapter 273: Ethan's Return

Crimson flooded her vision.

"Dad..."

Susan silently cried out in her heart. This address would forever remain buried deep within her, a word she'd never have the chance to say aloud to him.

Victor Thompson stood with his hands clasped behind his back, exuding an aura of natural authority. Some men were born rulers—even in stillness, they commanded the room with effortless dominance.

His cold gaze swept over Susan as if she were nothing more than an insignificant insect.

Her chest tightened. A crushing wave of sorrow threatened to consume her, leaving her too drained even for tears.

Blood loss blurred her consciousness. In her daze, she thought she heard Ethan's voice.

"Susan!"

A heart-wrenching cry echoed before she collapsed into warm arms. Darkness swallowed her whole.

"Susan!"

Ethan clutched her trembling body, his vision turning red at the sight of the horrific wound on her wrist. He snapped his head up, snarling at Victor, "Father! Who gave you the right to hurt her? You're killing her!"

"Susan..."

His hands shook as he patted her pale cheeks. She didn't stir, lifeless as a corpse.

Ethan had believed Susan dead. Grief-stricken, he'd exiled himself to the wilderness. Only concern for his mother, Catherine, had drawn him back after a month.

And there she was—alive.

His joy shattered instantly when he saw the blood gushing from her wrist, the Thompson bodyguards pinning her mercilessly to the floor.

"Move!" Ethan gathered Susan in his arms and charged forward.

The guards stood firm. "Second Young Master, put Miss Thompson down."

"She's bleeding out! She needs a hospital now!" Ethan's eyes burned with desperation, but his hold on Susan left him powerless to fight.

"Ethan, she harmed Nicole. She must pay with her life," Victor's voice was glacial.

"Father! This is Nicole's scheme!" Ethan's voice cracked with urgency. "Order them to stand down!"

"Nicole is your blood sister!" Victor's eyes flashed with anger.

"Mother forbade you from hurting Susan!" A spark of inspiration struck Ethan. "When she wakes, I'll tell her you broke your promise!"

At the mention of Catherine, Victor hesitated. Seizing the moment, Ethan bolted through the door with Susan in his arms.

In the hospital, Ethan's heart twisted at Susan's ghostly pallor. She felt weightless as a feather, as though she might vanish at any second.

"Susan, I'm back," he whispered. "No one will ever hurt you again."

The emergency light finally dimmed. The doctor confirmed she was out of danger. Ethan remained at her bedside, gripping her hand.

"Susan, I missed you," his voice broke. "I saw you in every mountain, every river."

A faint frown creased Susan's brow in sleep. Ethan tensed. "Does it hurt? I'm sorry I wasn't there sooner."

"Every person who hurt you will pay," his eyes darkened. "Even Nicole won't escape justice."

"Susan, I'm home." He repeated the words like a mantra, smiling until his eyes reddened. "I'm strong now. I can protect you from everything."

"So get better fast," he gently wiped the sweat from her forehead. "When you wake, let's get married, okay?"

"I've waited lifetimes just to marry you."
###Chapter 274: Andrew Lucas Gets Played!

Ethan Sullivan was a man of action. Realizing he had confessed his feelings but still owed Susan Thompson a proper marriage proposal, he immediately called his assistant Nathan Foster.

"Prepare a proposal setup right now," he ordered in a hushed tone. "Make it the most romantic arrangement possible."

After hanging up, Ethan's lips curled into an involuntary smile. He imagined Susan's delighted expression when she woke up, his breathing turning light with anticipation.

Susan opened her eyes to find the sunset painting the window.

She thought the voices she'd heard earlier were hallucinations, until she turned and met Ethan's radiant gaze.

He had lost some weight, but his boyish face still shone with sunshine. His eyes sparkled like constellations, impossible to look away from.

Blessed with his parents' perfect genes, Ethan had always been extraordinarily handsome. Yet his youthful energy was so dazzling it often overshadowed his striking features.

"Ethan..."

Tears welled up instantly in Susan's eyes. Though barely a month had passed, it felt like lifetimes.

"Susan!" Ethan flashed his signature brilliant smile. "I'm back!"

Seeing her tears, he fumbled for tissues.

"Don't cry, my princess," he said clumsily, dabbing her cheeks. "You won't be pretty if you keep crying."

His words coaxed a teary laugh from Susan. Seizing the moment, Ethan signaled Nathan to proceed.

"Look outside, Susan!" He feigned surprise, pointing at the window.

Countless colorful balloons suddenly ascended, each bearing gilded words: "Marry Me, Susan."

Next, several hot air balloons rose gracefully, their banners displaying the same proposal.

Though initially proud of his idea, Ethan suddenly worried it seemed cliché. He stole nervous glances at Susan's reaction.

The extravagant proposal quickly drew the entire hospital's attention.

Including Andrew Lucas, who had come to visit Nicole Capra.

At first, he smirked dismissively at the balloons. Such outdated romantic gestures had been passé for twenty years.

Until he read the name—

"Susan."

Andrew's pupils constricted. He immediately checked hospital records and found Susan Thompson's name.

Concern and fury surged simultaneously. He strode purposefully toward the upper floors.

The hospital room door stood wide open.

Andrew saw Ethan kneeling on one knee, holding a blinding bouquet of red roses.

"Susan, will you marry me?"

Andrew's knuckles whitened. He should have turned away, yet some unseen force propelled him forward.

Fresh tears streamed down Susan's face as she threw herself into Ethan's embrace.

Andrew felt his blood freeze.

She said yes?

The realization darkened his vision. Had he meant so little to her? Just a passing stranger?

Were all their tender moments and vows merely tools for her gain?

Andrew stared fixedly at the embracing couple, his chest pierced by an invisible blade.
###Chapter 275: The Bloodline Truth

Susan Thompson was about to speak when the hospital door suddenly swung open.

Andrew Lucas leaned against the doorframe, his dark eyes fixed on their intertwined hands.

Ethan Sullivan immediately shielded Susan behind him. "Andrew, you're not welcome here."

Andrew let out a cold laugh. "Ethan, you'd abandon your own sister for a woman?"

"What are you talking about?" Ethan frowned.

Susan gripped the bedsheet tightly. This wasn't the right moment for the truth—Andrew's arrival had ruined her plans.

"Exactly what I said." Andrew stepped closer. "Nicole Capra is in the ICU because of her."

Ethan shot to his feet. "Andrew! Are you blind? Look at Susan's wrist!"

The blood seeping through the bandage made Andrew's breath catch. His fists clenched involuntarily, but he forced himself to look away.

"She deserved it."

The words cut through Susan like a knife. She met Andrew's gaze head-on. "Mr. Lucas, please leave."

Andrew's expression darkened. He stared at her for a long moment before suddenly grabbing Ethan's collar. "Do you even know who she really is?"

"Let go!"

As they struggled, Susan saw Ethan slam against the wall. Ignoring the IV in her arm, she rushed to steady him.

"Are you okay?"

Ethan grinned through the pain. "Just a scratch."

The sight of their intimacy crushed Andrew's chest like a boulder. He turned to leave, but Susan's icy voice stopped him.

"Mr. Lucas, do you enjoy watching people in love?"

The taunt ignited his fury. He whirled around—only to freeze at the sight of Susan's pale face.

In the end, he stormed out, the door crashing shut behind him.

Silence finally returned to the room. Susan took a deep breath and gently squeezed Ethan's hand.

"There's something I need to tell you."

"Yeah?"

"We... we're siblings."

Ethan's smile vanished. He stared at her, eyes wide, before they welled with tears.

"R-really?"

Susan nodded, silent tears streaming down her cheeks.

Outside, Andrew slumped against the wall, the cigarette between his fingers long burnt out. The muffled sobs from inside the room made him slam his fist into the concrete.

Blood dripped from his knuckles, but the pain in his chest was far worse.
###Chapter 276: The Bloodline Truth

"Susan, what did you just say?"

Ethan Sullivan's coffee cup slipped from his fingers, shattering on the floor. Dark liquid splattered across the tiles. His eyes widened as if he'd heard something impossible.

"I'm your biological sister." Susan Thompson met his gaze steadily, her voice soft but firm.

"Don't joke about this!" Ethan burst into laughter, tears forming at the corners of his eyes. "Susan, we're the same age. If my mother had triplets, how could I not know?"

"Not triplets." Susan took a deep breath. "We're twins."

Ethan's laughter died instantly. He studied her face for a long moment, finding no trace of amusement in her eyes.

"Remember Greenhill Mental Hospital?" Susan asked quietly. "Nicole thought I was doomed and revealed everything."

She repeated Nicole's words verbatim—the hair sample used for the paternity test, the truth behind Catherine's injury.

Ethan's expression grew increasingly grave. He recalled the day his mother was hurt, realizing now how many details hadn't added up.

"I never believed you hurt Mom," he murmured. "But this is..."

Abruptly, he stood and paced the room. Susan waited silently, giving him space to process.

"I get it now!" Ethan suddenly rushed toward her, eyes blazing with realization. "That first time we met—I wanted to hug you immediately! It was a blood connection!"

Susan nearly laughed at his sudden leap in logic.

"Nicole could never be my sister!" Ethan waved his arms excitedly. "Someone as adorable as me deserves an even more adorable sister!"

He pulled Susan into a tight embrace, whispering in her ear, "Shame I can't marry you, but having a sister might be nice too."

Warmth flooded Susan's chest as she returned the hug.

"But Susan," Ethan grew serious, "we should still do a DNA test. Just to be certain."

Susan nodded. "I was thinking the same."

"I'll call the hospital now!" Ethan grabbed his phone, then paused. "And from now on, no more 'Mr. Sullivan.' Call me Ethan!"

Watching the vibrant young man before her, Susan finally smiled with relief. Whatever the test results might show, this moment of connection felt undeniably real.
###Chapter 277: Selling Susan to Alexander!

Ethan Sullivan had just pulled out his phone when Susan Thompson pressed his hand down.

"Don't call Nathan."

"Why?" Ethan tilted his head in confusion.

Susan pursed her lips. "Ethan, I'm not trying to drive a wedge between you. But after that car accident, he delivered your urn and made me believe you were dead."

"What?!" Ethan's temper flared instantly. "That bastard Nathan lied to you! I'll beat him to a pulp!"

Then his expression softened as realization struck. "But Susan, it must've been Dad's order. He just wanted to separate us."

Susan said no more. She knew Nathan would never harm Ethan. The warning was enough.

Ethan took Susan directly to Henry Johnson's newly opened hospital for testing. He supervised every step of the blood draw and analysis, terrified of any mistake.

By dawn the next day, the results arrived.

The report showed their mitochondrial DNA matched perfectly - undeniable proof they were siblings.

Ethan stared blankly at the document. Susan also seemed dazed. Though they'd suspected, seeing concrete evidence left them reeling.

So Nicole Capra had truly stolen her family.

Remembering Catherine Capra's past favoritism left a bitter taste. Now Susan understood - that woman wasn't her biological mother.

Catherine Capra was.

Her gaze fell on her bandaged wrist, eyes dimming. Yet her real father had wanted her dead.

Following her line of sight, Ethan slammed the report onto the floor in fury.

"That old fool Victor! When Mom wakes up, I'll make him kneel on durians!"

Imagining Victor kneeling on spiky durians made Susan burst into laughter. Ethan always knew how to cheer her up.

"I'll survive no matter what," Susan murmured. "Just to see Dad kneel on durians."

Ethan beamed, itching to shove the report in Victor's face. But for now, he needed to stay with Susan.

Just then, Alexander Grant entered with Patrick Pope.

Ethan's eyes lit up. He'd investigated Alexander and knew the man was pursuing Susan.

As Ryan Lucas's former admirer, Ethan held Alexander in high regard - certainly higher than Andrew Lucas who kept entangling himself with Nicole.

His appraising gaze grew increasingly approving, bordering on fervent.

Patrick shifted uncomfortably under the intense stare. He stepped protectively in front of Alexander, forcing a smile. "Young Master Sullivan, how do you like my outfit today?"

Ethan gave him a baffled glance before brushing past to enthusiastically link arms with Alexander.

"Alex, what do you think of my sister?"
###Chapter 278: Susan, Does It Hurt?

"Cough cough cough..."

Susan choked on her own saliva, her face flushing crimson. Ethan Sullivan's sudden address of "sister" had caught her completely off guard.

"Sister?" Alexander Grant's brow furrowed slightly, clearly unprepared for his romantic rival to suddenly become a brother-in-law.

"That's right!" Ethan nodded excitedly. "Susan and I took a DNA test. We're biological siblings!" He stood on tiptoe to pat Alexander's shoulder. "You'd better treat me well from now on, Alex."

He even winked at Alexander, the implication unmistakable.

"Understood." Alexander responded smoothly. "I'm currently pursuing Susan. Your guidance would be appreciated."

He extended his hand with perfect gentlemanly grace.

Susan nearly laughed at their absurd exchange. Guidance? When had she ever agreed to be pursued?

But Ethan enthusiastically shook Alexander's hand. "Absolutely! If you dare hurt my sister, you'll have me to answer to!"

He waved his fist threateningly, though the gesture lacked any real menace.

"Noted." Alexander replied calmly, his gaze softening as it settled on Susan's face. "Are you feeling better now?"

"Much better." Susan was about to politely suggest they leave when Ethan suddenly bounded toward the door.

"Alex, take good care of my sister!" He threw a flirtatious glance over his shoulder.

"Will do." Alexander smoothly took a seat by the hospital bed.

"Mr. Grant, surely you have work—"

"Would you like an apple?" Alexander had already picked up a fruit knife and begun peeling an apple with deliberate care.

Susan fell silent.

Patrick Pope stood nearby, watching their interaction with quiet relief. At least his boss wouldn't be going down that other path anymore.

"Should I step out, boss?" Patrick whispered.

"Want an apple?" Alexander glanced up.

Patrick shook his head vigorously. "No no, I'll just... go!"

The room fell into sudden quiet.

Susan's wandering gaze eventually landed on Alexander's slender fingers. His peeling technique was clumsy yet strangely mesmerizing.

"I can do that myself," she offered tentatively.

"You're injured." Alexander didn't look up.

Susan glanced at her bandaged left wrist, memories of the dungeon injuries darkening her expression.

"Susan, I'm courting you. No need for formalities."

"We're not suited."

"Quite the opposite." Alexander's tone brooked no argument. "Ethan approves. My grandfather approves. I approve. The only dissenting opinion is yours, which clearly must be mistaken."

Susan's eyes widened. What kind of thieving logic was that?

"Susan," Alexander suddenly asked softly, "does it hurt?"

Those three words unlocked something tightly sealed within her. Her eyes burned unexpectedly.

Yes. It had always hurt. But no one had ever cared enough to ask.

Alexander looked up, meeting her reddened eyes. Something struck his heart like a physical blow. Reason told him to restrain himself, but his body moved first—

He pulled her into a sudden embrace.

The moment their lips met, an enraged roar shattered the moment:

"What the hell are you doing?!"
###Chapter 279: Susan, His Treasured Jewel

Andrew Lucas stood at the hospital room door, his knuckles turning white.

He had just witnessed Alexander Grant leaning down to kiss Susan Thompson. The sight felt like a knife twisting in his heart.

Susan froze, clearly startled by the sudden kiss.

"What the hell are you doing?!" Andrew's voice was a low, dangerous growl.

Alexander chuckled, pulling Susan closer. "This doesn't concern you, Andrew."

Susan instinctively tried to pull away but hesitated when she saw Andrew's thunderous expression.

"Pathetic," Andrew sneered. "Daniel hasn't been gone long, and you're already moving on?"

Susan lifted her chin, her smile sharp with mockery. "Do I need your permission to be with someone, Mr. Lucas?"

"Susan!" Andrew's eyes burned with fury.

Just then, Nicole Capra's fragile voice drifted from the hallway. "Andrew, I've been looking everywhere for you..."

She clung to his arm, casting a pitiful glance at Susan. "Sis, I'm sorry... This is all my fault..."

Andrew scowled. "Apologize to Nicole, Susan."

"Why should I?" Susan laughed coldly. "Nicole, are you done with your little act?"

Nicole's eyes welled with tears as she hid behind Andrew.

"Susan!" Andrew snapped. "You owe Nicole a debt you can never repay!"

Alexander stepped between them. "The one who should apologize is Nicole."

"Alexander, you're being played," Andrew mocked. "A woman like her—worthless and fickle—is beneath you."

Susan's hands trembled slightly.

Alexander tightened his grip on her fingers. "Susan is nothing like that."

"Really?" Andrew let out a derisive laugh. "Because she hasn't wet the bed since turning eighteen? Since when are you so naïve?"

The air in the room turned suffocating.

Suddenly, Susan laughed. "You're right, Mr. Lucas. I don't deserve Alexander." She turned to Alexander. "Let's break up."

Alexander stiffened. "Susan!"

Andrew froze, caught off guard by her words.

A triumphant gleam flashed in Nicole's eyes, but before she could speak, Susan continued—

"But before that..." She rose onto her toes and pressed her lips to Alexander's in a deliberate kiss. "Let me prove just how 'dirty' I really am."

Andrew's fist slammed into the wall.
###Chapter 280: Dad, Susan Is Your Real Daughter!

The words "bed-wetting" struck Nicole like a slap across the face.

Her smile froze. Her nails dug deep into her palms.

Though Alexander didn't name names, everyone understood he was mocking her incontinence incident.

Nicole's face turned beet red. Her chest heaved violently.

"Pfft—"

Susan couldn't suppress her laughter.

Alexander was usually ice-cold. His sudden sarcasm created a stark contrast.

"You!" Nicole's eyes burned with venom, as if she wanted to tear Susan's face apart.

Susan blinked innocently. "Sorry, I just pictured someone wetting their bed..."

She feigned concern and leaned closer. "Nicole, bed-wetting is a medical condition. You should get it treated. Aren't you hospitalized right now? Is that what you're being treated for?"

"Oh, what did the doctor say? If it's incurable, you might need adult diapers!"

"Susan!" Nicole shrieked and stormed out.

Andrew stared at Susan in a daze.

Her eyes sparkled mischievously when she argued, just like a cunning little fox—exactly as she was four years ago.

His heart softened, and he chased after Nicole.

Feeling elated, Susan suddenly realized Alexander still had his arm around her.

She quickly pulled away, her ears burning.

Alexander calmly peeled an apple and cut it into small pieces, feeding her one.

"I can do it myself—"

Before she could finish, he stuffed a piece into her mouth.

Susan wanted to cry. Why was this man so domineering?

Only when Alexander left to take a call did she finally exhale in relief.

Ethan should have arrived at the Thompson residence by now.

Would Dad believe the truth...?

Ethan clutched the paternity test report, walking with purpose.

He imagined slapping the report onto his father's face and couldn't help but chuckle.

The servants exchanged glances—why did the young master seem so giddy today?

In the bedroom, Victor was gently wiping Catherine's hands.

"Dad!" Ethan skidded to a stop, his bravado instantly deflating.

He swallowed hard and carefully handed over the report. "Um... Nicole is an imposter. Susan is your real daughter!"

Victor's hand stilled.
###Chapter 281: Andrew Lucas Finds Nicole Capra Disgusting!

Victor Thompson's gaze locked onto the DNA report in Ethan Sullivan's hands.

Ethan waited eagerly for his father to recognize the truth. Instead, Victor snatched the document and tore it to shreds.

"Ridiculous!" Victor's face darkened. "Nicole and I already did a paternity test. She's my biological daughter! Ethan, has that scheming Susan Thompson completely brainwashed you?"

"Dad!"

Ethan stomped his foot in frustration. "Nicole is an impostor! She hurt Mom and keeps trying to kill Susan!"

He grabbed Victor's arm. "If you don't believe me, come to the hospital right now and do a DNA test with Susan yourself!"

"Test with her?" Victor sneered. "So you can fabricate more evidence?"

Ethan's eyes reddened with anger. "Dad! I swear on my life this report is authentic! Nicole stole Susan's hair for the original test!"

"What credibility do you have?" Victor glared. "You can't even manage your own life properly!"

"Dad..." Ethan's voice cracked. "When Mom wakes up and learns the truth, she'll be devastated—"

"Enough!" Victor grabbed a broom and swung at him. "Keep spouting nonsense and I'll break your legs!"

Ethan dodged frantically, shouting while running: "When Mom wakes up, I'll make you kneel on durians!"

After escaping the room, Ethan punched the wall.

His eyes burned with determination. Even if his father refused to acknowledge Susan, he would protect his sister.

In the hospital room, Nicole Capra wept dramatically.

"Andrew..." She threw herself into Andrew Lucas's arms. "Why does Susan have to humiliate me like this..."

Andrew stiffened.

He stared at the damp stain on his shirt, stomach churning. Why did this woman produce so much snot and tears?

"Stop crying." He patted her back awkwardly, already planning to discard the contaminated outfit.

His phone rang.

Andrew seized the excuse to push Nicole away. "Leo?"

"Mr. Lucas, we've recovered partial footage from the hotel surveillance!"
###Chapter 282: Andrew's Solitary Eternity

"Send it now!" Andrew Lucas commanded coldly before ending the call.

The VIP hospital room had excellent signal. The surveillance footage from Leo Miller arrived almost instantly on his phone.

It was just an ordinary clip, yet Andrew's finger hovered over the screen, hesitating to press play.

He feared confronting an unbearable truth.

Feared that Susan Thompson might truly be as vicious as the rumors claimed.

Most of all, he feared discovering he meant nothing to her.

Taking a deep breath, he finally tapped the video.

The grainy footage had clearly been restored. Though timestamp-free, it unmistakably showed Henry Bartley in a hotel parking garage.

Henry stepped out of a red sports car, glancing around furtively before dragging a bulging burlap sack from the backseat.

The thin fabric clearly outlined a human form inside.

Hoisting the sack over his shoulder, he hurried toward the elevator.

The video ended abruptly.

Andrew closed his eyes. When they reopened, all light had drained from them.

He'd clung to excuses, convincing himself Susan couldn't be this monstrous.

Reality had slapped him hard.

Their love story had been his solo performance all along.

Nicole Capra leaned in, recognizing the carefully staged scene she'd orchestrated. She'd instructed Henry to carry a mannequin that night, fabricating kidnapping evidence.

This was the only clip she'd allowed to survive—Andrew's smoking gun.

"So...this is how I was delivered to that room..." Nicole collapsed dramatically, covering her face with theatrical sobs. "Why me? What did I do to deserve this?"

She pounded the floor hysterically. "The whole world knows about my...my accident now! Just let me die!"

"You won't be disgraced." Andrew gripped her wrist. "I'll make you shine brighter than ever."

His voice turned glacial. "As for Susan...she'll pay."

"The female lead in 'General's Oath' is yours."

Nicole's eyes flashed with triumph. The coveted role in the blockbuster adaptation had been destined for rising star Bella Lucas—until now.

She feigned concern. "But with my reputation..."

"I decide who's worthy." Andrew cut her off.

Nicole seized the moment, rising on tiptoes to kiss him.

Andrew stiffened. The sight of her tear-streaked, snot-smeared face repulsed him.

Suddenly he remembered kissing Susan's tear-damp cheeks. Back then, he'd only felt tenderness—never disgust.

"Nicole!" A furious shout erupted from the doorway.

Ethan Sullivan stormed in, face contorted with rage. "Drop the act! You make me sick!"

"Ethan?" Nicole adopted a wounded expression. "How could you—"

"Shut up!" Ethan slapped away her reaching hand. "You reek of piss. Stay away!"

He wiped his palm on his pants with visible revulsion. "I came back to tell you—you're no sister of mine!"

"Susan is my real sister!"
###Chapter 283: Andrew, I Only Hope You'll Never Regret This!

Nicole's heels hit the wall as she suddenly remembered the cruel words she'd spat at Susan in Greenhill Mental Hospital. Back then, she'd been certain Susan wouldn't survive three days. Yet not only had that bitch lived, she'd exposed everything to Ethan.

Her nails dug into her palms, but Nicole forced a wounded expression. "Ethan, what nonsense are you saying? Father himself did the paternity test! It's written in black and white that we're siblings!"

"Did Susan poison your mind? What has she done to you?"

"Keep acting!" Ethan tore off his tie, eyes blazing. "The results are in. Susan and I share the same blood. As for you—"

He stepped closer. "You're just a fraud."

Nicole staggered against the wall, summoning tears instantly. "Ethan, Susan is a Thompson! I'm the sister who watched you grow up!"

"Shut up!" His fist slammed against the wall. "My real sister wouldn't have been a bedwetter!"

Watching Nicole's lips pale, he hissed, "While I was gone, you hurt Susan. Now—"

Each word dripped ice. "You'll pay a hundredfold."

"Ethan..." Nicole reached for his sleeve with trembling fingers, only to be violently shaken off.

"Ethan!" Andrew suddenly shielded Nicole. "Have you lost your mind? How could Susan possibly be your sister?"

His voice turned commanding. "Apologize to Nicole."

Ethan laughed then.

That laugh sent a shiver down Andrew's spine.

"Andrew," Ethan adjusted his cuffs leisurely, "sometimes I pity you."

"Played by a scheming woman, yet you treat her like treasure."

He met Andrew's gaze squarely. "I'll wait for the day you're drowning in regret."

Andrew's jaw tightened. "I, Andrew Lucas, never regret my choices!"

"No regrets?" Ethan scoffed. "Who abandoned his wife? Who pushed his own son off a cliff?"

"Susan betrayed me first!" Andrew's eyes frosted over. "That cripple doesn't deserve to be my son!"

Ethan went eerily calm.

"Andrew," his voice feather-light, "do you know how Susan lived these past four years?"

"Locked in a dungeon. Giving birth to Daniel without even a proper bed."

Andrew's heart spasmed, but he hardened his tone. "Lies!"

"Don't believe me?" Ethan pulled photos from his inner pocket. "Then see what your precious first love has done!"

The pictures rained down on Nicole's face like snow. When she saw their contents, all color drained from her cheeks.
###Chapter 284: I Will Never Betray You, Andrew Lucas!

Nicole Capra's face turned deathly pale the moment Ethan Sullivan finished speaking.

A stack of photographs was flung violently in front of her, scattering across the floor.

The images captured intimate moments between her and Sean Stapleton. Some showed her straddling his lap, others depicted them drinking arm-in-arm, and several revealed his hands wandering over her body.

"Andrew, this is your fiancée's true nature!" Ethan sneered. "She claims Susan framed her, but what about these photos?"

Andrew Lucas bent to pick up one photograph, his expression terrifyingly calm.

The image showed Sean's hand resting on Nicole's chest.

"Andrew!" Nicole rushed forward to grasp his arm. "Let me explain—"

Ethan cut her off. "Explain what? How you actively seduced Sean?"

"That's not true!" Tears streamed down Nicole's face. "Four years ago... when you needed surgery money after your injury, I—"

Her voice broke, her entire body trembling.

A flicker of emotion finally crossed Andrew's eyes.

"I'd just entered the entertainment industry with no connections." Nicole lifted her tear-stained face. "Hostessing paid twenty thousand per night... I... I only let them touch me, nothing more—"

She suddenly pushed Andrew away. "I'm not worthy of you! Let's break up!"

Andrew yanked her back into his embrace with startling force.

"Silly girl." His voice turned hoarse. "After all you sacrificed for me, how could I ever reject you?"

Nicole sobbed violently against his chest.

Ethan shook with rage. He'd expected these photos would expose Nicole's true colors, but she'd spun herself into a self-sacrificing saint with just a few words.

"Andrew! Wake up!" Ethan roared. "She's lying to you!"

Andrew shot him an icy glare. "Enough."

Ethan clenched his fists. He knew Andrew's nature—repaying kindness tenfold. Nicole's "life-saving grace" made her untouchable in Andrew's eyes.

He needed irrefutable evidence.

Meanwhile, at the Variety of Beauties Club.

Vincent King stood smoking at the corridor's end, his brow furrowed with irritation.

His mood hadn't improved since witnessing Susan's intimate scene with Alexander Grant on set.

"That little slut Susan..." A lewd chuckle sounded behind him. "Five grand was all it took—what a bargain!"

"Right? Acting all virtuous when she just wanted cash..."

Vincent's cigarette snapped between his fingers.

Turning, he saw two men leering at a phone screen displaying Susan's photo.

"I offered to keep her and she refused—turns out I didn't flash enough bills!"

Vincent's gaze turned glacial.

So that's how it was.

Crushing his cigarette, he strode toward the elevators. If she preferred transactions, he'd bury her in money until she surrendered.
###Chapter 285: She's Not Even Homewrecker Material!

Vincent King crushed his cigarette with force, his knuckles turning white. He pulled out his phone and jabbed at the screen.

"Get me $100,000 in cash—now! Deliver it to A Variety of Beauties within ten minutes!"

"Find out which private room Susan Thompson is in!"

In less than ten minutes, Roger Davis arrived with the cash and handed over a slip of paper with the room number.

Vincent snatched the stack of bills, his expression dark as storm clouds. He strode toward the private room, his back radiating icy fury.

In the corner, Candy Wilson bit her lip so hard she tasted blood. Her nails dug into her palms as she watched Vincent's retreating figure.

Lately, he had grown colder toward her. Even when they shared a bed, he refused to touch her.

What shattered her most was hearing him whisper Susan's name in his sleep.

Tonight's scheme was supposed to expose Susan's true nature. Instead, it had only fueled Vincent's possessiveness.

A venomous glint flashed in Candy's eyes. She pulled out her phone and dialed several numbers rapidly.

If Vincent refused to wake up, she'd make sure Susan was ruined beyond repair.

Susan had only been discharged from the hospital two days ago. The wound on her wrist still ached faintly, but it didn't hinder her movements.

Tonight, Cecilia Grant had invited her to discuss a public service ad—a project advocating for disabled children, something Susan cared deeply about.

When she pushed open the private room door, she saw Cecilia's message saying she'd be late. Susan decided to wait.

Just as she was thinking about how to convince Victor Thompson of her true identity, the door was kicked open.

Vincent stood in the doorway, radiating menace, his gaze terrifyingly dark.

Susan frowned and stood, ready to avoid this madman. Before she could take a step, a thick stack of cash slammed into her face.

The $100,000 hit like a brick, making her vision blur. Bills scattered across the floor, the garish red staining the carpet.

"Vincent, have you lost your mind? Get out!"

Trembling with anger, Susan bent to gather the money to throw back at him—only for Vincent to shove her onto the couch.

"Five grand to service two men—did you enjoy it?" His voice was glacial. "I'll double it. You're not leaving tonight."

Susan had no idea what he was talking about. She struggled desperately, aggravating her wrist injury. Cold sweat dripped down her back from the pain.

"Let me go! This is assault!"

Vincent sneered and knocked her phone away. "Stop pretending to be innocent. You took the money—now deliver."

As his hands grew more aggressive, Susan's eyes burned with panic. Her injured left hand was useless, and her right was pinned.

"You're married! Think about how Candy would feel!" She tried to appeal to his reason.

"Married?" His lips curled mockingly. "Paying for fun isn't cheating. Susan, you're not even homewrecker material."

BANG—

The door burst open as a swarm of reporters rushed in, cameras flashing.
###Chapter 286: Susan Slaps Vincent with Cash!

The private room door burst open. Cecilia stormed in with her girl squad, fury blazing in her eyes when she saw Susan pinned to the couch by Vincent.

"Vincent!" Cecilia lunged forward and punched him square in the face.

The red marks on Susan's wrists made Cecilia see red. She knew all about this toxic dynamic—how Vincent kept falling for Candy's manipulative games, yet dared lay hands on Susan!

The solid hit forced Vincent to release his grip. Cecilia shielded Susan behind her like a protective lioness.

"Think money gives you the right to do anything?" Vincent wiped blood from his lip, eyes darkening. "A woman like you has no right to play hard to get."

"Like hell!" Cecilia smashed a chair against the floor. "Touch Susan again and I'll make sure you're tomorrow's headline! Should we invite Candy to witness this?"

At Candy's name, Vincent's expression shifted. He shot Susan a cold glare before turning to leave.

"Stop."

Susan's voice froze Vincent mid-step. He turned to see her gathering scattered bills from the floor.

"Take your money." Susan strode over and flung the cash in his face. "It's filthy."

The fluttering bills made Vincent's face twist with rage. He grabbed Susan's chin. "You asking for death?"

Susan met his gaze fearlessly. "Mr. King, give this money to whoever you want. But don't think you can humiliate me with it."

She wrenched free, her skirt swirling with finality. The Vincent who once took a knife for her was dead—this man was just a stranger blinded by lies.

Vincent watched Susan leave, emotions churning in his eyes. "You'll regret this," he spat before slamming the door.

Around the corner, Candy clenched a flash drive. Though her plan had been disrupted, she'd captured enough to ruin Susan.

"Mr. Wang from the Daily?" Candy dialed with a venomous smile. "I've got an exclusive scoop..."

She could already see Susan's downfall. This time, she'd make sure Susan never recovered.
###Chapter 287: Kneel and Lick It Clean!

"Susan, are you okay?" Cecilia Grant rushed forward to steady Susan Thompson's swaying figure. She remembered Susan's medical condition clearly, and her heart clenched at the sight of her pale face.

"I'm fine." Susan forced a weak smile. "Cecilia, let's focus on business first."

Cecilia hesitated. She wanted to insist on taking Susan to the hospital, but seeing her stubbornness, she reluctantly agreed to discuss work first.

The partners in the private room were all Cecilia's close friends—straightforward women who had always admired Susan. After witnessing Vincent King's behavior, their outrage grew.

The first half-hour of the meeting turned into a condemnation session against Vincent.

"Does being handsome give him the right to act like that? Money doesn't excuse everything!"

"Exactly! Our Susan doesn't tolerate such nonsense!"

"That move where she threw the money in his face was epic!"

Susan had worried they might look down on her, but instead, she was showered with praise that made her ears burn.

Like-minded people made work effortless. By the time the plan was finalized, it was already late at night. Cecilia and the others returned to their studio, while Susan prepared to head straight home.

Before leaving, she decided to visit the restroom.

In the hallway, Susan froze at the sight before her.

Michelle Thompson sat in a wheelchair, barking orders at Bella Quinn. Bella wore a janitor's uniform and a mask, but the scars peeking out remained horrifying.

"Ah—!" Michelle suddenly shrieked.

Bruce Bowman burst out of a private room and grabbed Michelle's hand. "What happened?"

"Bruce..." Michelle's eyes welled with tears. "I just wanted some fresh air when I ran into Bella... She dumped trash on me!"

Her pants were stained with filth, making her look pitiful.

Bruce's gaze turned icy. "Bella Quinn!"

Bella stood motionless, her expression hidden behind the mask. But her eyes brimmed with sorrow.

"She stuck her own foot into the trash bin."

"Lies!" Bruce roared. "Michelle can barely walk. How could she do such a thing?"

"She's not disabled at all!" Bella finally snapped. "She's been faking it!"

Slap!

The blow sent Bella's mask flying, revealing her scarred face. Her left cheek swelled instantly, making her appear even more grotesque.

"Bella!" Susan rushed forward, only to be shoved aside by Bruce.

"Susan, stay out of this!" Bruce gripped Bella's throat. "Last chance—why did you hurt Michelle?"

"Bruce, have you lost your mind?" Susan lunged again but was thrown violently to the ground.

"Susan!" Bella struggled to help her but was pinned down by Bruce.

"Kneel." Bruce's voice was cold as steel. "Lick the filth off Michelle's feet clean."

He forced Bella to the floor.
###Chapter 288: She Regretted Saving a Devil

"On your knees."

"Lick it clean!"

Bruce Bowman's voice was like a poisoned ice pick, stabbing straight into Bella Quinn's heart.

Susan Thompson trembled with rage, but her legs were too weak to stand after the fall. Blood dripped from her reopened wrist wound.

Bella was forced down, her knees slamming against the marble floor. She bit her lip, eyes burning.

For a moment, she was eight years old again.

In the earthquake ruins, she'd clawed through rubble to rescue a boy with injured eyes. He'd called her "Little Crescent," his voice as gentle as her grandmother's lullabies.

She never regretted saving him.

Not even when he forced her to jump into the sea.

But now—she did.

She regretted saving a devil.

A devil who murdered his own child.

"Bella Quinn, lick it clean! Apologize to Michelle!" Bruce's command dragged her back to reality.

Bella suddenly laughed.

How absurd. He always demanded apologies from her. But who would apologize for her pain?

"Bruce, I did nothing wrong." She lifted her head, eyes hollow. "Even if I drenched her in filth, she deserved it!"

A vein throbbed at Bruce's temple. Michelle's sobs grated on his nerves.

"Calvin, step aside. She's doing this today."

Calvin Grant glanced at the sticky mess on Michelle's shoes, chest heaving.

"Have you lost your mind?" He shielded Bella behind him. "No one touches the woman I love."

Bruce felt an inexplicable irritation.

"So my woman deserves to be humiliated? Bella, kneel!"

Before he finished, a fist smashed into his face.

Andrew Lucas appeared in the hallway, fury blazing in his eyes. Ethan Sullivan and Calvin's punches followed.

"Susan!" Ethan rushed to help her up.

Andrew's outstretched hand froze midair before he withdrew it with a bitter smile.

Calvin stood guard before Bella, voice sharp as a blade. "Bruce, you're getting dumber by the day."

Bruce wiped blood from his lip, gaze venomous.

As they faced off, Bella slowly rose. She looked at Bruce, the last light in her eyes extinguishing.

"Bruce, the Little Crescent who saved you is dead."
###Chapter 289: Exposing Her Fake Disability

Bruce Bowman's eyes darkened with terrifying intensity as he glared at Bella Quinn shielded behind Calvin Grant.

"Calvin, are you really willing to ruin our friendship over this woman?"

Calvin smirked coldly, pulling Bella further behind him.

"Just because you're blind and foolish, Bruce, doesn't mean everyone else is."

Michelle Thompson chose that moment to burst into theatrical sobs, tears streaming down her face.

"Bruce, let it go... I know Bella didn't mean it..."

She reached to wipe the stain on her dress but recoiled dramatically when her fingers brushed the trash.

Bruce immediately seized her hand protectively.

"Michelle, don't touch that filth!"

Calvin scoffed and snapped his fingers.

A waiter promptly arrived carrying a basin of ice water.

"Since you're too tenderhearted to clean her up, allow me."

Before anyone could react, the entire basin was dumped over Michelle's head.

"Ahhh!"

Michelle shrieked and leaped to her feet, completely forgetting her pretense of being wheelchair-bound.

Calvin arched an eyebrow. "How remarkably nimble your legs are, Miss Thompson."

Bruce's face turned livid, his fists clenched audibly.

"Calvin!"

"What?" Calvin dusted his sleeves indifferently. "I merely helped prove Miss Thompson isn't actually disabled."

Michelle paled, her lips trembling wordlessly.

She suddenly erupted into violent coughs, collapsing weakly against Bruce.

"Bruce... I'm so cold..."

Bruce hastily wrapped his jacket around her before shooting a venomous glare at Bella.

"This isn't over."

Calvin stepped squarely into his line of sight.

"Bruce, you should get your eyes checked."

Turning away, he swept Bella into his arms without warning.

"Put me down!" She struggled.

"Stay still." His arms tightened. "You're still injured."

The intimate sight sent a storm raging in Bruce's eyes.

He shoved Michelle's wheelchair forward aggressively—only to overbalance it.

"Crash!"

The wheelchair toppled, sending Michelle sprawling into the garbage pile.

"Michelle!" Bruce scrambled to help her up.

Though tears of pain streamed down her face, she forced out, "I'm fine..."

Nearby, Andrew Lucas gripped Susan Thompson's wrist tightly.

"You're bleeding."

Susan wrenched free. "None of your concern."

Ethan Sullivan immediately shielded her. "Andrew, stay away from my sister!"

"Your sister?" Andrew sneered. "Susan, you'd lie about being a Sullivan just to get close to their family?"

Susan didn't bother responding, turning to leave.

Andrew seized her again. "I'll take you to the hospital."

"No need." She pulled away. "I'd rather not risk another car accident."

The barb struck like a knife.

Andrew stood frozen, watching Ethan tenderly escort Susan away, his fists whitening.

Michelle continued whimpering. "Bruce, let's go home..."

But Bruce's gaze remained fixed on Bella's retreating figure, his expression inscrutable.
###Chapter 290: Susan, Don't Flatter Yourself!

Ethan Sullivan gripped Susan Thompson's wrist tightly, glaring sharply at Andrew Lucas.

"Andrew, cut the fake act!"

Andrew repeated expressionlessly, "I'm treating her wound."

"Not needed!" Ethan sneered. "Susan's affairs are none of your concern!"

"You'd rather watch her bleed?" Andrew scoffed. "Ethan, are you seriously this childish?"

Ethan fell silent. He looked down at Susan's bleeding wrist, his brow furrowed.

"My car has my mother's special medication," Andrew said coolly. "A hundred times better than pharmacy drugs."

Ethan clenched his teeth. He knew Victoria Lucas's medical skills well. For Susan's sake, he had to relent.

As he hesitated, Andrew suddenly yanked Susan into his arms. The elevator doors opened just then, and he carried her inside.

"Let me go!" Susan struggled desperately.

"Susan!" Ethan rushed forward but only saw the closing elevator doors.

Andrew shoved Susan into the backseat. She immediately reached for the door handle.

"Stay still!" he barked.

"I don't need your fake kindness!" She pushed him hard.

Andrew pinned her beneath him, his voice dangerous. "Keep moving, and I won't mind taking you right here."

Susan froze. She knew this man's vile nature too well and stopped resisting.

Andrew grabbed the first-aid kit and roughly seized her wrist. But as he unwrapped the bandage, his fingers trembled slightly.

Two gruesome scars came into view—one old, the other still bleeding.

"Does it hurt?" The question slipped out before he could stop himself. His face immediately hardened. "Susan, don't misunderstand. I'm saving you only because I don't want you to die too easily."

"I know," Susan said calmly.

Those three light words made Andrew's chest tighten. He applied the medicine roughly. "A vicious woman like you deserves to suffer!"

"Andrew!" Susan suddenly looked up. "Insult me all you want, but don't you dare insult Daniel!"

"That crippled brat?" Andrew sneered. "Is he worthy of inheriting the Lucas family?"

"You bastard!" Fury burned in Susan's eyes. "Daniel's leg will heal! And you're the one who caused all this!"

Her lips curled mockingly. "Oh, I heard you and Nicole Capra have been partying every night? Reeks of piss. Disgusting."

"Susan!" Andrew roared, grabbing her chin.

Susan broke free and ran, but he dragged her back and slammed her against a pillar. He crushed his lips against hers, his voice hoarse.

"Let me make sure you smell exactly what's on me."
###Chapter 291: Susan's Scandal

Susan shoved Andrew away.

His crisp masculine scent enveloped her like the first winter sunlight—pure enough to make her heart tremble.

Her earlier words had been spoken in anger.

But Andrew took them seriously.

The underground parking lights flickered as her back pressed against the cold wall. His punishing kiss stole her breath.

A phone rang abruptly.

Andrew glanced at the caller ID, brows furrowing.

"Nicole?"

"Andrew, have you seen Susan?" Nicole's voice wavered like a fragile white flower in the wind. "The internet is exploding with rumors about her..."

Susan's stomach dropped.

Andrew hung up and tapped open a news alert.

"D-List Influencer Seduces Married Man!"

The video clearly showed her and Vincent entering a private room together. Blurred photos followed, depicting entangled figures that invited speculation.

Susan's hands shook slightly.

She opened the trending hashtag. A flood of vitriol assaulted her.

"Homewrecker bitch!"
"She should be stoned!"
"Vincent and Candy are true love!"

Candy's tearful interview topped the feed. The camera captured her playing the victim, accusing Susan of betrayal.

"I considered her my closest friend..."

Susan scoffed.

What masterful lies.

Andrew's expression darkened dangerously. He seized her wrist with bruising force.

"You drugged yourself for Vincent?"

His voice dripped ice.

Susan lifted her chin, meeting his gaze head-on.

"You believe her?"

The air froze between them.

Andrew's eyes shadowed before he suddenly swept her into his arms.

"If you're this desperate for a man, I'll oblige."
###Chapter 292: That Disgusting Plastic Surgery Freak Susan!

"Andrew Lucas, have you lost your damn mind?"

Susan was slammed against the car door without warning, her back throbbing from the impact. She struggled desperately but couldn't match the man's brute strength.

Just when she thought there was no escape tonight, Andrew suddenly released her, shoving her away with visible disgust.

He leisurely adjusted his suit cuffs, his handsome features glowing cold under the streetlight.

"Susan, did you really think I'd touch you?" His lips curled into a mocking smile. "Vincent King's used goods? You're filthy."

Susan's face paled before she swung her handbag at him with full force.

"Mr. Lucas overestimates himself." Her laugh was icy. "Even if I wanted a boy toy, I'd pick someone young and vigorous. An old man like you? I wouldn't take you even if you paid me!"

She turned on her heel, stilettoes clicking sharply through the silent night.

Andrew remained rooted, his eyes darkening like spilled ink.

He knew the online rumors were false. If Susan had ever been involved with Vincent, she wouldn't have resisted to the death back then.

But the words stuck in his throat.

Too proud to explain, he'd rather let her misunderstand.

Remembering Susan's defiant demeanor moments ago, his lips quirked unconsciously. The little woman had grown bolder since leaving him.

Pulling out his phone, he dialed Leo Miller.

"Boss?" Leo's sleepy voice answered.

"Candy Wilson's dirty laundry. Release it now."

Hanging up, Andrew narrowed his eyes at the distant neon lights. Those who dared target what was his would pay.

Leo stared at the abruptly ended call in confusion until he saw Susan's trending scandal.

"Tsk tsk, tsundere much?" Shaking his head as he uploaded Candy's compromising materials, he muttered, "The boss is playing white knight now."

Late night streets. Susan tightened her scarf waiting for a cab.

The online abuse escalated—rumors of plastic surgery, fabricated escort past, even fake "before" photos circulated.

"That $30 ugly whore thinks she can be a star?"
"Plastic freaks should be banned from entertainment!"
"Heard she even services homeless grandpas. Disgusting!"

Susan switched off her phone, closing tired eyes.

The taxi soon reached her apartment. As she stepped out, a gust tore off her face mask.

Before she could readjust it, a liquor-soaked hand grabbed her wrist.
###Chapter 293: Susan Thompson Was Sickened by Him!

The man's rough tugging caused Susan's scarf to slip from her neck and fall to the ground.

Her delicate face was fully exposed under the dim glow of the streetlight.

The one gripping her was a drunken middle-aged man, his dark skin flushed from alcohol, his greasy face twisted into a leering grin.

He stood half a head taller than Susan, his thick arms clamping around her slender wrists like iron shackles.

The pungent stench of cheap liquor wafted from the bottle in his hand, making Susan grimace.

"Get off me!"

She turned her face away in disgust, but the man slammed her against the cold brick wall.

A sharp pain shot through her back, forcing a gasp from her lips. Her injured wrist throbbed with numbness.

The man squinted at her through drunken eyes before suddenly smashing the bottle onto the pavement.

He pulled out his phone and flipped through photos, comparing them to her face.

Susan recognized her own perfume advertisement still.

"Susan Thompson?" He leaned in, reeking of alcohol. "Finally found you!"

His greedy gaze roamed over her face, his Adam's apple bobbing.

"I'm your biggest fan! Followed you since your debut!"

The overpowering stench of liquor made Susan turn her face away, fighting nausea.

"Let me go!"

The man let out a grotesque laugh. "Let you go? Your scandals are all over the internet!"

His fingers tightened, turning Susan's face pale with pain.

"Plastic surgery! Escorting! Homewrecking!" He spat through gritted teeth. "How could you betray your fans?"

"Those are all lies!" Susan forced calm into her voice. "You should believe me!"

"Believe you?" He sneered, loosening his grip.

Susan seized the chance to bolt, but he yanked her back against the wall.

"Photos and videos don't lie!" He sprayed spittle as he shouted. "The news says you're nothing but trash!"

His face contorted with growing fury.

"You know how sick I felt seeing your pre-surgery photos?" His voice dripped venom. "So ugly I puked for three days!"

Susan stiffened, her shoulders aching under his bruising grip.

"We can talk this through..." She softened her tone.

"Talk my ass!" The man suddenly pulled out a crumpled ten-dollar bill. "Heard you go for ten bucks a pop? Tonight, you're mine!"

He shoved the money roughly down her collar.
###Chapter 294: Descent into Despair

Susan's fingers clenched her collar so tightly her nails nearly drew blood from her palms.

"Those are all lies online!" Her voice trembled. "I've never done those things!"

The man's alcohol-laced breath burned against her face, making her stomach churn.

"Call the police?" He sneered, loosening his tie. "Even they'd think you're filthy!"

When the crumpled bill struck her cheek, the sting felt like fire.

"Playing innocent?" He grabbed her chin. "You'd sleep with a garbage collector but act coy with me?"

Susan's hand flew out, her palm cracking against his greasy face.

"Bitch!" Enraged, he struck back.

The blow left her ears ringing, stars exploding in her vision. Staggering back, she stomped her heel into his foot.

"Ah!" He doubled over in pain. Seizing the chance, she drove her knee upward.

As he collapsed, clutching himself, Susan turned to flee. The apartment door was within reach—her fingertips brushed the cold metal handle.

"You're dead!"

Agony ripped through her scalp as he yanked her backward by her hair. Coarse rope bit into her wrists. The more she struggled, the tighter it became.

"Mrs. King was right," he panted, unbuckling his belt. "You're just a slut who needs to be taught a lesson."

Susan's pupils shrank.

Candy.

The name slithered into her heart like a venomous snake. So this was all that woman's doing.

The musty minivan reeked of mildew as he shoved her inside. Her knees scraped raw against the ground, but his brute strength overpowered her.

A phone rang abruptly.

"Got her?" The man simpered into the receiver. "Don't worry, you'll get the video tonight."

Ice flooded Susan's veins. The van's dark interior yawned before her—an abyss with no return.

Once inside, her life would be over.
###Chapter 295: Alexander Grant and Susan Thompson's Private Moment

Memories flooded back, making Susan tremble uncontrollably.

Those four years of imprisonment in utter darkness were like a sharp knife, relentlessly carving into her heart.

Though the guards had tormented her, at least they'd stopped touching her after her failed suicide attempt.

Back then, she'd had Vincent King by her side.

Now, she was about to be locked away in another lightless cage, forced to endure that man's abuse day after day.

"Let me go!"

Susan struggled desperately, using every ounce of strength left in her bound limbs.

The man's face darkened as he roughly shoved her into the trunk.

Darkness swallowed her, and Susan's heart sank into despair.

She would never see Daniel again.

Or Ethan Sullivan.

"Ah!"

A scream pierced the night.

The trunk suddenly opened, her restraints were undone, and she fell into a pair of warm, strong arms.

"Susan, I'm sorry I'm late."

Alexander Grant's voice was deep and steady.

Patrick Pope stood nearby, his expression tense.

"You're dead!"

The drunkard scrambled up from the ground and lunged at Alexander with a snarl.

Patrick moved to intervene, but someone was faster.

Ethan Sullivan kicked the drunkard flying, then planted a foot on his chest.

"Please, spare me, Young Master Sullivan!"

Recognizing Ethan, the drunkard instantly cowered.

"You dare lay hands on my sister?" Ethan sneered, raining down punches and kicks.

The drunkard curled into a ball, muttering Candy Wilson's name between curses, his eyes burning with hatred.

"To the hospital," Alexander ordered, his brow furrowing at the sight of Susan's swollen cheek and bleeding wrist.

"No need. I have medicine at home."

Susan tried to wriggle free, but his grip only tightened.

"Susan, I've got to go," Ethan suddenly announced, shooting Alexander a meaningful look. "Alexander, she's all yours."

"Mm."

Ethan nodded in satisfaction, then turned to Patrick. "What are you standing around for? Third wheel much?"

"I—" Patrick looked wounded.

Without waiting for an explanation, Ethan dragged him away.

Susan gaped.

Had her brother just played matchmaker?

Worse, her injuries weren't limited to her wrist. How was she supposed to treat the scrapes beneath her clothes?

Just the thought of being alone with Alexander made her pulse race.
###Chapter 296: Heroic Rescue Leads to Deeper Bonds

Susan Thompson watched Alexander Grant's retreating back as he carried her toward the apartment complex. Her fingers unconsciously tightened around the hem of her shirt.

The elevator ride was suffocatingly silent.

"Mr. Grant, really, this isn't necessary." Susan squirmed in his arms. "I can tend to my own injuries."

Alexander's grip didn't waver. "Stop moving. You'll aggravate the wound."

The elevator dinged open.

Susan's hands trembled as she fumbled for her keys. The idea of a man entering her single woman's apartment at this hour unsettled her.

"I'm fine now, truly." She planted her feet stubbornly at the doorway. "It's so late, you should—"

"Open the door." His tone brooked no argument.

With a resigned sigh, Susan turned the key.

As she bent to remove her shoes, her phone clattered to the floor. The screen illuminated a glaring notification: "D-list influencer Susan Thompson accused of threatening Mrs. King to steal her husband."

Susan's fingers froze midair.

"Pathetic." A bitter laugh escaped her. "I don't even have Candy Wilson's number."

Alexander's gaze flickered across the screen. "Ignore the noise."

"You... believe me?" Susan looked up, meeting his fathomless eyes.

"Obviously." Two simple syllables that made her nose sting with unexpected emotion.

Once, those who should have trusted her most were the first to cast doubt. Yet this man...

"Thank you," she whispered.

Alexander frowned. "I told you—no need for formalities."

He strode to the kitchen, returning moments later with a peeled hard-boiled egg.

"For your wrist." He extended it. "To reduce swelling."

Susan blinked. He'd noticed the injury she'd been hiding.

Meanwhile, outside the apartment building...

Leo Miller crouched in the shadows with several bodyguards, sweat beading on his forehead.

"Boss..." His hand shook as he dialed. "Miss Thompson... Mr. Grant took her to his place..."

The sound of shattering glass exploded through the phone.

"Playing hero?" Andrew Lucas's voice could have flash-frozen hell. "Over my dead body."

Leo shrunk into his collar, already envisioning his impending doom.

Inside the apartment, Susan fumbled with the medical supplies. Her injured right wrist made every movement clumsy.

Alexander stood nearby, his frown deepening with each passing second.

"Let me." The words burst out finally.

"No!" Susan recoiled instinctively. "I can manage."

Alexander exhaled sharply before turning to pour her a glass of warm water.

"At least... allow me to do this much."

As Susan stared at the offered glass, something shifted. Perhaps this intimidating man wasn't so terrifying after all.
###Chapter 297: Nicole, Let's Have a Baby!

Susan Thompson watched Alexander Grant rummaging through her kitchen with growing unease.

Had he gone mad with hunger?

"Mr. Grant, I only have eggs," she murmured hesitantly.

He turned, holding an egg in his palm. The warm light accentuated his striking features.

Susan instinctively shrank deeper into the couch.

Even holding an egg, he looked like he was cradling some priceless treasure.

"I'm not hungry." Alexander suddenly sat beside her.

His warm fingers pressed the egg gently against her swollen cheek.

Susan stiffened.

"To reduce swelling," he explained curtly.

The rolling sensation felt unexpectedly soothing. Gradually, her tense muscles relaxed.

"I can do it myself—"

"Can you move your hands?" He glanced at her bandaged wrists.

She fell silent.

"Consider me your doctor." His tone left no room for argument.

Drowsiness crept over her. Before she knew it, Susan had dozed off against the couch.

Alexander studied her peaceful sleeping face, his lips curving slightly.

He gathered her carefully into his arms.

In her sleep, Susan suddenly wrapped her arms around his neck and mumbled, "Mom..."

Alexander froze.

"Mom's the best..."

Amused yet unwilling to let go, he carried her to bed.

That night, Alexander slept on the couch in his clothes. Moonlight streamed through the window, making the modest furniture feel strangely comforting.

Meanwhile, outside the apartment complex...

Andrew Lucas stood in the freezing wind, his dark gaze fixed on the illuminated window.

At dawn, he finally saw Alexander's departing figure.

A cold smirk twisted his lips as he pulled out his phone.

"Nicole, come to Willow Lane."

His voice dripped with icy determination.

"Let's have a baby."
###Chapter 298: Andrew Lucas Losing Sleep Over Nicole Capra?!

Having a baby?!

The message from the other end of the line made Nicole Capra bolt upright in bed.

What did having a baby mean? It meant intimacy!

She had once tried every trick to seduce Andrew Lucas, even resorting to drugging him, but failed. This sudden invitation felt like manna from heaven.

Nicole pinched herself hard.

The sharp pain made her gasp.

Not a dream.

The pain transformed into sweet palpitations, making her glow with unusual radiance. The bruises from Bianca Quinn's beating still ached faintly, but none of that mattered now.

She had to appear flawless before him.

Nicole began meticulously applying makeup before the mirror. Layers of foundation concealed the bruises, her porcelain skin glowing pearl-like under the lights. She spritzed herself with the legendary limited-edition perfume, its floral richness enveloping her like a garden.

The makeup required special effort.

She opted for a deceptive natural look, with slightly downturned outer corners to appear vulnerable. After practicing countless smiles in the mirror, she finally perfected it—thirty percent elegance, thirty percent nobility, forty percent coyness.

Choosing an outfit proved challenging.

Red seemed too bold, black too cold, pink too juvenile. She finally selected a sheer red silk dress paired with a pristine white coat—innocent yet seductive.

Her heart pounded like thunder during the journey.

Breath caught in her throat as she pushed open the bedroom door.

Andrew sat rigidly on the bed, his perfect frame accentuated by the black suit. Sunlight gilded his edges, his breathtakingly handsome face like a deity descended. The dark circles beneath his eyes betrayed a sleepless night.

Had he been thinking of her?

The thought set Nicole's entire body aflame.

"Andrew..." she cooed, her voice dripping with honeyed sweetness.

The man remained silent.

She approached slowly, the red dress swaying with each step. "What you mentioned on the phone... is it true?" Her fingers nervously twisted the fabric. "Ever since losing that baby, I've thought about it every day—"

She suddenly noticed the door remained ajar.

Hurriedly locking it, she continued.

"I know I'm no longer pure..." Shedding the coat revealed her alluring figure. "But my heart belongs only to you."

Her dewy eyes fixed on him unblinkingly.

One minute.

Two minutes.

No reaction.

Unable to restrain herself, Nicole flung herself at him. Just as she rose on tiptoes for a kiss, an overwhelming force slammed her down—

She found herself brutally pinned to the bed.
###Chapter 299: He Could Never Love Anyone But Susan

Nicole Capra froze for a second before her eyes lit up with excitement.

She adored domineering men like Andrew Lucas. His aggressive behavior made her heart race.

Being overpowered thrilled her in ways she couldn't explain. A forceful kiss would make this moment perfect.

She reclined seductively on the bed, allowing Andrew to approach. As his lips neared hers, she instinctively closed her eyes.

But the passionate moment she anticipated never came. Instead, she was suddenly flung through the air and slammed onto the floor.

Tears welled up instantly in Nicole's eyes as she stared at Andrew in disbelief. The man who had been so intimate moments ago had just thrown her away.

"Andrew..." She curled up pitifully, her voice trembling with hurt.

Hearing her voice seemed to snap Andrew back to reality.

Susan's betrayal had enraged him. He wanted to prove he didn't need her.

That's why he'd called Nicole over.

But when he actually pinned her beneath him, Susan's face kept flashing before his eyes, making it impossible to continue.

Nicole's overpowering perfume and makeup made him nauseous.

Worse, he suddenly remembered her bedwetting incident. Before he could stop himself, he'd thrown her off.

Susan and Nicole were nothing alike.

Susan carried a faint, natural fragrance that intoxicated him. But Nicole...

"Andrew, why are you treating me like this?"

Nicole's tearful eyes looked heartbreakingly vulnerable.

Andrew knew he owed her an apology. He lit a cigarette, his expression obscured by smoke.

"Nicole, I'm sorry."

He had been thinking about Susan. After two puffs, he recalled how Susan hated the smell of smoke.

As he moved to stub it out, he laughed bitterly at himself.

What right did Susan have? Why should he care what she hated?

Yet he still extinguished the cigarette.

"You're disgusted by me, aren't you?" Nicole sobbed harder. "I know I'm tainted now. You have every right to be repulsed..."

Andrew wasn't in the mood to comfort her.

"Nicole, go home."

Nicole's eyes widened in shock. She couldn't believe he was dismissing her like this.

She was crying her heart out, and he remained unmoved?

"Andrew, I might as well die!" She played her trump card.

"I'll accompany you to the kindergarten performance tomorrow." Andrew just wanted this drama to end.

Nicole's eyes brightened. That was the same kindergarten Susan's son attended.

Flaunting their relationship there would devastate Susan!

Satisfied with this thought, she left contentedly.

She needed to hurry and discuss strategies with Henry Bartley—how to eliminate Susan for good.

When Susan Thompson woke up the next morning, she immediately checked her phone.

She expected to find it flooded with hateful comments, but instead saw an outpouring of support and comfort.

As she puzzled over this, a news alert popped up:

"Homewrecker Forces Wife to Miscarry, Leaving Her Infertile for Life!"
###Chapter 300: The Truth Revealed! Candy Is the Real Homewrecker!

Susan's finger hovered over her phone screen.

The word "homewrecker" stung her eyes.

She thought Candy was scheming behind her back again. But when she opened the notification, she froze.

The news was about Candy herself!

The photo clearly showed Candy in a revealing nightgown, snuggled in a married man's arms.

Even worse, the man's wife had been pregnant at the time.

Susan scrolled down.

The爆料 was shocking: Candy had actively seduced the wealthy married man, then sent their intimate photos to his wife. She'd even called to taunt the pregnant woman, causing a miscarriage and permanent infertility.

"This is the so-called Nation's Sweetheart?"

Susan scoffed.

Her phone vibrated. Cecilia Grant's studio had posted an official statement:

"Susan Thompson has never undergone plastic surgery, never worked as an escort, never drugged anyone, and is certainly not a homewrecker."

Accompanying childhood photos showed Susan's natural beauty from kindergarten through college.

The comment section exploded.

"Now THIS is a real beauty!"
"How dare that plastic-faced Candy criticize others?"
"Susan, we wronged you!"

Then surveillance footage from A Variety of Beauties surfaced.

It clearly showed others had been in the private room that night besides Susan and Vincent.

"I knew Susan wouldn't do such things!"
"Candy's vile - a homewrecker who framed others!"

Susan's followers skyrocketed.

One million.
Two million.
Three million.

She rubbed her eyes, hardly believing it.

The irony deepened when someone exposed Candy's charity event records.

"Red carpet leech!"
"Center-stage queen who never donates!"
"Even when Susan was a nobody, she donated $20K!"

Public opinion completely reversed.

Susan exhaled in relief. Finally, she could attend tomorrow's parent-child event without worry.

Morning sunlight bathed the kindergarten entrance.

Little Daniel clung to Susan's hand, but his gaze drifted toward the distance.

Andrew Lucas stood with Nicole Capra, laughing as they entered the school.

Susan felt Daniel's small hand tighten.

"Mommy, I'm okay." He forced a smile.

Just then, a tall figure approached against the light.

Alexander Grant strode toward them in black athletic wear.

"Sorry I'm late." He crouched to Daniel's eye level. "Shall we do the sports day together?"

Daniel's eyes instantly brightened.
