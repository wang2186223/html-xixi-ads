When I felt him bite them, I squirmed it stung, but I felt his tongue glide over his bite mark soothing the pain. But he just pressed his hardness against my thighs, rubbing slowly, but not entering. I squirmed, look at him with a mix of shyness and frustration. \"Why are you looking at me like that?\" My cheeks flush instantly. \"What do you want?

I, Stella Winston, seemed to have it all—beauty, a loving family, and a wealthy fiancé. But my perfect world shattered when my fiancé, Brian, and my sister, Lucy, betrayed me. I was compelled to become the substitute bride, marrying Adam Lancaster, a disabled man in exchange for care for my grandmother. Just when I thought all hope was lost, I discovered Adam was not at all like the rumors suggested.",

As mockery turns to awe, A-lister Ethan Smith hijacks headlines by posting a video of himself pleading to publicly date her—upending his \"Ice King\" persona. Beyond the spotlight, Lucy’s hand-drawn talismans stun mystics, her films dominate awards, and her tech empire reshapes industries. When asked about retiring to inherit her family fortune, she declares, “I’ll keep acting,” while Ethan—now her doting CEO husband—vows to bankroll her stardom indefinitely. The internet’s verdict? Lucy isn’t just rewriting her story; she’s scripting a legacy where genius and love defy every limit.",

    "description": "I never imagined I’d end up as Mrs. Alexander Kane. The cold, enigmatic billionaire barely notices anyone—let alone me. But when his grandfather's will demands that he marry and have a child within 18 months, I become his unexpected choice after he dismisses dozens of other women. Why me? I don’t know. But I’m determined to make him see me as more than just a convenient solution. Life in his world is nothing like I imagined. Beneath his frosty exterior lies a man haunted by secrets—and the closer I get, the more dangerous it feels. What started as a simple arrangement is quickly becoming something far more complicated. Now, I’m risking everything—including my heart. Can I melt the heart of a man who’s never believed in love, or will I be the one left shattered and alone?",

    "description": "Evelyn Sinclair thought marrying into the Blackwood dynasty would secure her future. Instead, she awakens to a nightmare—her \"husband\" Nathan is secretly funding her rival, her best friend is a spy, and her own identity is a lie. Trapped in a gilded cage, Evelyn discovers her late parents’ murder was no accident. The Blackwoods stole her inheritance, replaced her with a changeling twin, and used her as pawn in a decades-old power play. Now, with a hidden camera exposing their darkest secrets, she must navigate a deadly web of corporate espionage, arranged marriages, and a long-lost sibling determined to destroy her. Armed with nothing but a sharp wit and a thirst for vengeance, Evelyn wages war on the family that shattered her life. But when Nathan’s \"first love\" returns with proof of a secret child, Evelyn realizes the biggest betrayal might be the one she’s been living…",

    "description": "For ten long years, she poured her heart and soul into loving a man whose heart was as hard as stone and covered in thorns. Every attempt to get closer left her wounded and scarred by his cold and unfeeling demeanor. When an unexpected pregnancy forces her to confront the reality of her unreciprocated love, she realizes she can no longer sacrifice herself for a love that only brings pain. Her heart, once full of hope, is now too weary to continue. She decides to leave, to escape the cycle of hurt and longing. But the man, who had grown accustomed to her silent suffering and steadfast presence, is not willing to let her go. As he struggles to win her back, he begins to understand that the source of his true happiness has always been in her hands. In this journey of heartbreak and redemption, he must prove that he can change and that his love for her can be as deep and unwavering as hers once was. Will she find it in her heart to forgive and give their love a second chance, or will she walk away forever, leaving him to realize too late what he has lost?",
